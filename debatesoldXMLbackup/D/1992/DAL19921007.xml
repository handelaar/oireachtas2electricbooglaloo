      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I beg leave to announce for the information of the Dáil that, on 8 September 1992, the Government appointed Deputy Noel Treacy, Minister of State at the Department of Finance, to be Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for the new county enterprise partnership companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 from Deputies De Rossa, John Bruton and Spring.  I <Col N="2" /> propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call first on Deputy Proinsias De Rossa to state the matter of which he has given me notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the serious economic and monetary crisis facing the country increasing the underlying trend of unemployment, threatening the jobs of workers in exporting companies and increasing mortgage interest rates enormously.  I contend there is an absolute necessity for European-wide action to curb currency speculation threatening not only our economy but that of many other European countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I seek your permission to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the urgent and important matter of the increase in interest rates and the currency position, in particular, their impact on jobs and on the living standards of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to the request made by the Parliamentary Labour Party to the Taoiseach's office last week and to my notice to you, Sir, under Standing Order 30 I request permission to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to consider the following motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann views with extreme concern the rapidly deteriorating situation in the economy, as evidenced by historic levels of unemployment, significant threats to home owners and business from increases in interest rates, a draconian series of cuts in basic social welfare programmes, and the instability caused by the European monetary crisis and the impact of the devaluation of sterling.</P>
      <P>This House resolves to hold a full scale debate on this crisis and calls on the Government to facilitate such debate by the allocation of two days of Government time for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply I want to inform the Deputies concerned and the House that I have received notice from the Government Chief Whip advising me that it is proposed to have statements tomorrow and Friday on recent events in the monetary market affecting the Irish economy.  Accordingly, the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing the matters.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to withdraw my motion for the reason given but I would be somewhat concerned if this proposed debate were to be concerned solely with monetary matters.  We must be concerned also with the fact that mortgage interest rates have risen and that a large <Col N="4" /> number of people have lost their jobs, which matters must be dealt with also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be more appropriate to raise such matters when this proposal is before us tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask you, Sir, for my information and that of the House whether it is your intention to allow the debate which the Leaders of the Opposition parties here sought and to inform us whether this Government proposal is a replacement of that intention.  It appears to me that statements on these issues hardly constitute an adequate way of dealing with the current position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is immaterial really.  I would remind the House, as I have done before, that the only motion before the House under Standing Order 30 is that the House do adjourn to allow discussion of the matters raised.  In respect of statements under Standing Order 41, I should say that that Standing Order treats the matter in a similar fashion.  Therefore, in effect, under both procedures, the matter is discussed. There is no substantive motion before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) No. 1 shall be decided without debate; (2) In the case of the Second Stages of Nos. 2, 3 and 4: (i) The opening speech of the Minister or Minister of State and the speeches of the main spokespersons nominated by Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) The speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed 20 minutes and (iii) The Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply not exceeding 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Private Members' Business which shall be No. 36/Motion No. 39 shall commence at 6 p.m. and the proceedings <Col N="5" /> thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight and Members shall be called upon to speak as follows: 6.00 p.m.-6.30 p.m. &mdash; Fine Gael; 6.30 p.m.-7 p.m. &mdash; Government; 7 p.m.-7.30 p.m. &mdash; Labour; 7.30 p.m.-8 p.m. &mdash; Government; 8 p.m.-8.15 &mdash; Democratic Left; 8.15 p.m.-8.30 p.m. &mdash; Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>(4)  The sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal that No. 1 be decided without debate satisfactory?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with the Second Stages of Nos. 2, 3 and 4 satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are satisfactory. My only concern relates to the provision for the speeches of other Members.  I hope the Chair will ensure reasonable proportionality between the parties in the way in which Members will be called to speak so that all Members will be treated equally in terms of access to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the proposals are satisfactory and agreed. Are the proposals for dealing with Private Members' Business this evening satisfactory?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m. today?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the debate taking place tomorrow on the economic situation and in the light of the relentless growth in unemployment, the 3 per cent increase in mortgage interest rates and the fact that our social system contains little incentive for people to create jobs and little incentive for some people to take them up, can I have an assurance that the Government will introduce comprehensive legislation at an early date to remove the barriers to the creation of jobs in our economy so that this can become a genuinely fully employed economy within a reasonable timeframe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the contributions from Deputy Bruton and members of his party tomorrow to <Col N="6" /> produce any new ideas and initiatives they have for consideration in relation to tackling the unemployment problem. The debate should be very helpful in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to promised legislation in conjunction with the announcement made last night.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention in meeting the Opposition leaders to have meaningful consultations or have the Government made a decision already which cannot be changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not anticipate what the consultations will be about.  Consultations are consultations. That is what they mean and that is what they are intended to mean.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last remark of the Taoiseach, I suggest he is not offering very much time to the parties in Opposition to consider whatever proposals he has if he expects to finalise Government decisions by the end of this week.  That is an aspect we might deal with when we meet him later today. I want to raise a specific matter relating to proposed legislation.  Does the Taoiseach intend to issue a programme of legislation for this session?  Will he consider in any such programme laying out a timetable for the implementation of the programme? With regard to the second Finance Bill which was promised for the autumn, when is it likely to be before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that a question has been tabled at Question Time in relation to the legislative programme. It is only proper to wait and to answer it on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is looking for sincere consultation and co-operation. This House is prepared to give it if we are provided with an opportunity to do so.  I have asked a fairly simple question and I presume the Taoiseach knows the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do and I presumed the Deputy would have known the answer without even asking.  This is a matter <Col N="8" /> which is always dealt with by the Whips and the Deputy can be assured that the Government will be forthcoming regarding consultative time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>In the context of the arrangement for the finances of the country, is it intended to bring forward a supplementary Estimate for the Department of the Environment to deal with the crisis in public housing?  Do the Government intend to bring forward a further Estimate to deal with that problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

My understanding is that this Bill has not yet been published.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that this legislation is quite urgent in view of the fact that the Government were unable to say in answer to Deputy Richard Bruton whether they would introduce legislation to underpin the expenditure of £50 million.  If money on that scale can be spent without the approval of the House, clearly we need to tighten up the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate, with amendments, the law relating to the election of members to Dáil Éireann.  If the Oireachtas sees fit to enact the measure it will mean that, for the first time, the entire law in relation to Dáil elections will be contained in a single statute.</P>
      <P>The existing law on the conduct of Dáil elections is contained in 14 different pieces of legislation, the earliest of which dates back to 1923.  In addition, legislation relating to the questioning of a Dáil election is contained in a number of British enactments, the earliest of which is dated 1852.  The law relating to electoral offences is contained mainly in the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923.  The Act has been extensively amended over the years.</P>
      <P>The sheer number of statutes relating to Dáil elections and the extensive amendment of the principal enactments have left the law in a very fragmented state.  This is particularly inappropriate in the case of the electoral code which is of direct and immediate relevance to all citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be of benefit to everybody to have the basic law relating to the election of our national Parliament set out in a single comprehensive piece of legislation which is accessible and meaningful.  This Bill will bring that about.  The Bill is essentially a Dáil electoral measure. While it contains certain references to the codes relating to Presidential, Seanad, European and local elections and referenda, the Bill does not purport to consolidate <Col N="15" /> those other codes or to amend them in any comprehensive way.  This, in so far as it may be necessary, will be a matter for another occasion.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the changes in substance proposed in the Bill and, where they are not self-evident, to indicate the reasons for the proposals.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to the registration of electors are contained in Part II and the Second Schedule.  In this area, quite extensive changes are proposed, changes which arise from experience in the operation of the system over many years, and include suggestions for improvement made by Members of the Oireachtas, local authorities and others.</P>
    <P>In regard to the accuracy of the register, I would like to put it on record that the standard is by no means as deficient as is sometimes suggested.  However, there is no room for complacency and we must seek ways of securing substantial improvement.  The changes I am proposing will provide the framework for significant advance.</P>
    <P>A new and shorter time-scale for preparing the register will be introduced. Under existing law, work on the draft register commences in mid-September, the draft register is published on 1 December and the period from 1 December to 15 January is allowed for the display of the draft and the submission of claims for correction.  The revision court sittings have to be completed by 28 February. The register of electors is published on 1 April and comes into force on 15 April.  One of the problems with this timetable is that some of the information in the register is already seven months out of date by the time the final register is published.  Another is that the time for scrutiny of the draft register by public representatives and the public generally spans the Christmas holidays.</P>
    <P>The proposed new timetable, which is set out in the Second Schedule addresses both these aspects and will, I hope, set the scene for significant improvement in the accuracy of the register.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill for the publication of a supplement containing the names of qualified electors omitted <Col N="16" /> from the register.  Unfortunately we are all too familiar with instances where persons who may have been on the register for decades find themselves omitted for no apparent reason.  We can understand and sympathise with the anger and frustration of people who find themselves in this position, particularly as there is no means of restoring them to the register.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill and Part II of the Second Schedule set out a procedure under which a person incorrectly excluded from the register can have his or her name added by means of a supplement. On discovering the omission, the person concerned can apply to the local authority which will carry out the necessary inquiries and rule on the application. The applicant will be notified and, on the occurrence of an election or referendum, a supplement to the register containing the names of successful applicants will be published.  Where an application is turned down the person concerned will have the right of appeal to the county registrar and subsequently to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The test in every case will be that the person must have been eligible for inclusion in the register for the area in question on the appropriate qualifying date.</P>
    <P>Because of the necessity to ensure that every application is fully checked out and to prevent the status of the register proper being undermined, it is necessary to have a cut-off point for applications. This is set at the 12th day before the polling day.  This is really the latest date practicable.</P>
    <P>Registration in respect of more than one address will be specifically prohibited by the Bill and it is made clear that inquiries by the registration authority and county registrar for this purpose may extend beyond their functional area.</P>
    <P>While the Constitution and the electoral law make it clear that a person may vote only once at an election, the existing law in relation to the registration of electors does not specifically provide that a person may be registered only once.  In a Supreme Court judgment on a case taken by students at Waterford Regional Technical <Col N="17" /> College, it was held that existing law does not prohibit plural registration Prior to this judgment, electors were registered on the basis that a person was entitled to be registered once only at the place at which he or she was ordinarily resident.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court ruling is an authoritative statement of existing law.  It is not, however, an interpretation of a constitutional provision, or a statement of any constitutional or other fundamental right.  The court has simply clarified the meaning of the existing provision in the law.  It does not preclude amendment of the law.  Under the Constitution, this is a matter for the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>With their practical experience of elections, I am sure Deputies will agree that multiple registration would leave the way open for serious electoral malpractice.</P>
    <P>Section 11 makes it clear that a person may be registered once only as an elector. Where a person may have a claim to be registered in respect of more than one address he or she may exercise an option. In effect, the Bill will restore the position to what it was generally assumed to be before the Supreme Court ruling.</P>
    <P>Gardaí will have the option of registering as postal voters or as ordinary electors. Under existing law, a member of the Garda Síochána who is registered as an elector is entered in the postal voters list and may vote only by post.  Following requests by the Garda representative associations, section 14 provides that each garda will have the right to opt for registration as a postal voter, in which case he may vote by post only, or for registration as an ordinary elector, in which case he may vote in person at the polling station for his locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of publishing a list of additions and deletions rather than a full draft register is provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been represented that there would be advantages in publishing a list <Col N="18" /> of proposed additions and proposed deletions rather than a full draft register each year.  This would make it possible to see proposed changes at a glance and it should also help cut down the cost of handling and printing.  Section 16 enables the arrangement to be introduced on an experimental basis in selected areas.  It successful, the arrangement could then be extended generally.  It may well be that the electors lists arrangement will prove beneficial in some areas while the draft register may be more suitable in others.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer may, in future, meet three-quarters of the cost of preparing the register rather than one-half as at present.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, the cost of preparing and publishing the register of electors is borne equally by registration authorities and the Exchequer.  This principle of shared costs will continue, but under section 20, the proportion of costs borne by the Exchequer will be increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent.  Provision is also included in this section to allow the Minister to impose penalties on registration authorities for inaccuracies in the register or for delays in the preparation and publication where these are attributable to the registration authority.  The section is so worded as to permit the State contribution, at some time in the future, to be incorporated into a block grant rather than continue as an <i>ad hoc</i> grant.</P>
    <P>The Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1986, introduced a system which enables disabled electors to vote in their own home.  Under the special voting arrangement, a presiding officer accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána conveys a ballot paper to the elector at his or her home.  While the system is expensive and cumbersome to operate, it is an important and welcome facility for housebound electors and will be continued in force by section 17.</P>
    <P>Existing law requires an applicant for entry on the special voters list to produce a medical certificate each year certifying the nature and extent of his or her physical illness or disability and indicating that <Col N="19" /> the applicant is of sound mind and capable of comprehending the act of voting.</P>
    <P>The requirement in relation to &ldquo;sound mind&rdquo; may give offence to some disabled persons and the requirement of an annual medical certificate could cause inconvenience and, possibly, expense to the electors concerned.  The opportunity is, therefore, being taken to remove the &ldquo;sound mind&rdquo; requirement altogether and to provide that a medical certificate will be required only in the case of first application.  Registration authorities will be empowered to require a fresh certificate, where they consider it necessary to do so, for example if the special voter goes to live in a different registration area.  The Bill also extends the period for application for inclusion in the special voters list from one month to almost three months.</P>
    <P>The Bill restates, with some amendments, the law relating to the registration of political parties which was first introduced in the Electoral Act, 1963.  The wording of the provision has been improved to give greater clarity and, in particular, the role of the appeal board has been clarified.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the Registrar, who is the Clerk of the Dáil, will publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> his proposed ruling on any application made to him and any person aggrieved by the proposed ruling may appeal to the appeal board.  Each appeal must be accompanied by a deposit of £500 which will normally be refunded but may be forfeited if the appeal board considers the appeal frivolous or vexatious.</P>
    <P>Specific power is given to the Registrar to terminate the registration of a party if it has ceased to operate as such or is no longer entitled to be registered.  There is provision for appeal to the appeal board against a decision of the Registrar in this regard.</P>
    <P>Certain changes are proposed affecting the position of the candidate at a Dáil election.  Of these, the most important is the proposal that the deposit be increased from £100 to £500.  As the House is aware, the figure of £100 was fixed in <Col N="20" /> 1923 and has remained unaltered.  I understand that today's equivalent of £100 in 1923 would be over £3,000.  The threshold for refund of a deposit will be reduced from one third to one quarter of the quota.</P>
    <P>From the practical point of view, I think there can be no question about the necessity for a deposit, fixed at a reasonable level, or some other mechanism to provide a deterrent to non-serious candidates at an election.  In a parliamentary democracy, a general election represents the most fundamental exercise of the democratic power of the people.  In an ideal situation, every candidate should be genuinely seeking election, prepared to undertake the obligations which a parliamentary mandate will confer, and prepared to play a full part in the business of parliament, should that question arise.  The electors should be allowed to make their decisions without the distraction of non-relevant candidates.</P>
    <P>Our arrangements for nomination of candidates are probably the most open of any electoral system.  Quite literally, any Irish citizen, irrespective of place of birth or residence, irrespective of any contact whatsoever with the constituency or the country, can nominate himself or herself as a candidate or be nominated by just one elector.  It does not require a very fertile imagination to picture the confusion which could be caused at an election by swamping the ballot paper with the names of large numbers of irrelevant candidates.  Prudence requires that sensible arrangements should be in force.</P>
    <P>Requiring a deposit as an earnest of serious intent is of long standing, is well known and understood and, of course, the deposit is refunded if the candidate attracts a certain minimum level of support. That minimum is being reduced from one third to a quarter of the quota. This approach seems to be the most sensible way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>The free postage arrangement for the election address of candidates is retained under section 57.  There is some dissatisfaction at the way the arrangement works at present and there have been <Col N="21" /> suggestions for change.  To enable these to be fully developed, the Minister will have power to modify the existing arrangements, following consultation with interested parties and with the approval of both Houses.  I understand that consultation in this regard has begun.</P>
    <P>Under section 165, a candidate who contests two polls on the same day, at each of which the free postage arrangement applies, will be entitled to include material in relation to each such poll in a single election letter.  A candidate who contests more than one constituency at a Dáil election will be allowed free postage in one constituency only.  Having regard to the high cost of the free postage facility, this seems a very reasonable restriction.</P>
    <P>Some relatively minor changes are proposed in the requirements in relation to ballot papers.  It is the general practice nowadays to give each candidate exactly the same amount of space on the ballot paper.  The Bill will make this a mandatory requirement.  The candidate's first name and surname will be printed in capitals, rather than in ordinary type.  The requirement that the surname and party name, or the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo; where appropriate, should be in large block capitals will be retained.</P>
    <P>The practice has grown up in some areas, of stationing large groups of canvassers outside polling stations in a last minute effort to influence voters.  For some people, this is part of the colour and excitement of the election process and is accepted as such.  For other electors having to run the gauntlet in this way is a cause of some anxiety.  From the point of view of candidates and parties, this last minute canvassing makes no sense.  Far from influencing people, it is quite likely to antagonise them and to damage rather than improve a candidate's prospects.</P>
    <P>Section 147 will prohibit all political activity in the vicinity of a polling station for the duration of the poll and for half an hour before and after.  The prohibition will apply to congregating, canvassing in any form, display of posters and use of loudspeakers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> The prohibition will apply to any place within 50 metres of any of the entrances to the grounds of a polling station. Having regard to the different kinds of location in which polling stations are situated, this seems to be a reasonable distance.</P>
    <P>In regard to procedures in the polling station itself, no change of substance is proposed.  However, the opportunity has been taken to amend the Presidential Elections Act, 1937 to provide that an elector employed by the local returning officer in connection with a presidential election may be authorised to vote at an alternative polling station.  This will make good an omission in the presidential elections law which, unlike the other electoral codes, has no such provision at present.</P>
    <P>Parts XVIII and XIX restate existing law on arrangements for the counting of the votes and restate the counting rules under the single transferable vote system. Two technical amendments in the counting rules will be of interest.  The returning officer will be empowered to note on the ballot paper concerned his ruling on any doubtful ballot paper which is allowed as valid.  This will ensure that the same papers will not come up for adjudication again at a later stage in the count, or on a recount.  Their validity will be dealt with, once and for all, at the commencement of the count.  The provision will complement the provision in existing law which allows the returning officer to mark &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; on any ballot paper he rules to be invalid.</P>
    <P>In section 122 the rule on the exclusion of two or more candidates together is clarified.  The present rule in this regard is very restrictive.  It creates the situation where the returning officer may have to eliminate, possibly, three or four candidates individually even though they may have only a handful of votes between them.  The new provision is less restrictive and will make it possible to eliminate a number of candidates together if it is clear that none of them can secure enough transfers to save their deposit.</P>
    <P>Existing law on election petitions, which dates from the latter half of the <Col N="23" /> last century, provides for two separate procedures &mdash; one involving investigation by election commissioners and the other a petition tried by two judges of the High Court.  Both procedures are archaic and cumbersome and not really suitable for our proportional representation system.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out a new procedure under which Dáil election petitions will be tried by the High Court.  The new procedure is modelled on that which applies in relation to European Parliament elections and which worked satisfactorily in the petition relating to the constituency of Leinster at the 1989 European elections.  Under the new procedure, a petition may be presented by any elector on any grounds likely to have affected the result of the election in the constituency.  A deposit of £5,000 must be lodged as security for costs.  The petition will be tried by the High Court with right of appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>Litigation to question the result of a Dáil election is, fortunately, quite rare. There has been only one such petition since the foundation of the State.  Even though petitions are rare events it is appropriate that there should be an effective and efficient statutory procedure for dealing with them.</P>
    <P>Section 168 provides that a petition questioning the result of a referendum may only be presented with the leave of the High Court.  This is to ensure that changes in the Constitution, which have been approved by the people and may be urgent, cannot be delayed by a person presenting a frivolous petition.  Before giving leave to present a petition the High Court must be satisfied that there are good <i>prima facie</i> grounds.  Such leave has to be sought within ten days after publication of the provisional results of the referendum.</P>
    <P>Section 172 provides that a review of the European Parliament constituencies must be carried out before 1 December 1993.  This will mean that the review will be related to the population figures ascertained at the census taken in April 1991 and that any changes decided on can be in <Col N="24" /> place in good time for the next European elections which will be held in June 1994. Future revisions will be carried out at ten yearly intervals, that is, in the interval between the publication of census figures and the holding of a European election.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in this introductory statement, I have touched on all the proposed substantive changes which will be of special interest to Members of the House.  I would like to draw attention to the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill which sets out in some detail the contents of the different Parts of the Bill and its Schedules.  Should Deputies wish me to expand on any particular aspect of the Bill, I will be happy to do so in replying to Second Stage.</P>
    <P>In my view, this is a good, constructive, worthwhile and timely Bill.  Its provisions are entirely non-controversial and I look forward to a useful and positive debate. I believe the Bill is worthy of support.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to welcome Deputy Dukes who has been appointed to the Front Bench.  I look forward to working both with him and Deputy McCartan who has been appointed as his party's spokesperson.  I hope we can have a good debate on this issue and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his kind comments and look forward to working with him and his colleagues on these issues.  I suppose, Sir, that it might be something of a malapropism to say that I find the placing of this Electoral Bill at the top of our agenda for this autumn session to be rather pregnant with meaning.  In today's circumstances it might be going a bit far to say that but it is significant.  I wonder if the Government are telling us that they have a hidden agenda or perhaps the Taoiseach is trying to tell his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats something in a slightly more tactful way than he has on previous occasions up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general I welcome the Bill and most <Col N="25" /> of the amendments that it proposes in the law relating to the holding of elections of Members to this House.  I believe the Bill will help to clarify some aspects of existing law.  I think we would all agree that clarity in the law is desirable for everybody concerned.  The House should give a general welcome to Bills which bring forward consolidation legislation. Indeed, I have often thought that it might be useful if the House were to set aside a certain period each year for legislation to consolidate existing legislation.  I am not one who believes that the performance, usefulness and productivity of this House should be measured only in terms of the number of pieces of legislation that we pass in a given year. Indeed, I should say that I am personally very suspicious of the kind of mania that requires us to pass new legislation for every conceivable problem.</P>
    <P>I should say also that I find a great deal of the comment in the media, who sit in judgment upon us, about the amount of legislation that we pass in this House every year to be utterly disingenuous; it is a kind of word count or Act count measure of performance which has very little to do with content, whereas a Bill of this kind where the content is extremely important is probably more significant in its own way than a number of other measures.  Consolidation legislation is very much in the interest of the efficient working of our administration and therefore in the interest of the citizen.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very good example: it sets out to repeal 12 Acts and parts of 11 others.  It sets out also to repeal three sets of regulations and parts of three others. I have no doubt that that will be of service to Members of this House, to future candidates for election, to returning officers and, above all, to the electorate.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that this Bill proposes to continue in operation a number of very enlightened provisions.  It continues, for example, the extension of the Dáil franchise to British citizens which was initiated by the Government of which I had the honour to be a member in 1985 and it also extends the provisions relating to the granting of the postal vote to servants <Col N="26" /> of the State stationed abroad and the provisions in relation to the registration of disabled electors as special voters.  Both of those measures were introduced by that same Government in 1986 and I am delighted to see that provisions of that kind are being continued in this Bill with, in one case in relation to the question of British citizens, a very useful, if somewhat detailed, addition to the provisions that are already in place.</P>
    <P>Before going on to comment further on the provisions of this Bill I would like to commend and congratulate most sincerely the Members of Seanad Éireann who succeeded in persuading the Government to drop this asinine proposal for the banning of the taking of opinion polls in the seven days immediately preceding an election.  That formed part of the Bill as it originated in the Seanad.  The reasons given for that proposal by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, were incredibly stupid and paternalistic.  It might be no harm to look back on them because they give an indication of the view on the part of the Government which we should be aware of.  He said and I quote from column 361 of the Seanad Official Report of 6 February last:</P>
    <P>It is now generally recognised that polls have a significant effect on the manner in which electors vote and this was, in fact, confirmed by a poll published last June.  Polls can and do produce a bandwagon effect.  They provide the necessary information for tactical voting and vote management, practices which could be held to distort the genuine expression of the people's choice.</P>
    <P>Even the Minister of State is smiling at that.  One would have to go a long way before they would find anything more idiotic than that.  To say that polls, by encouraging people to indulge in tactical voting and vote management, in some way distort the result of an election is most insulting to the intelligence of a great many voters who have, whatever political parties may say to them, from <Col N="27" /> time immemorial in the context of our electoral system a very developed view of the advantages of tactical voting and the advantages to their own areas of tactical voting in order to secure representation for their areas.  For a Government to come along and say that polls, because they help people to do this, must in some way be mischievous is absolutely daft.</P>
    <P>Let me quote again from the same column:</P>
    <P>It is important, too, that the elector's choice should represent genuine conviction and not represent a second guess based on what the polls are saying or the interpretation of them by sophisticated party managers.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy O'Hanlon really believes that people are not able to make up their minds and I wonder will he be taking the same view in debates that will be held between now and 3 December. Will Deputy O'Hanlon be eschewing any attempts to influence people in making up their minds in that interval of time?  I do not think he will.  I think he will seize on any poll or other evidence he can get to support the point of view he wishes to put forward.</P>
    <P>Statements such as that are interesting. We have to remember that that proposal was originally contained in the Bill.  The Government went through the solemn procedure of bringing a Bill into this House.  A policy statement was made to Government by the Minister for the Environment, there were heads of a Bill, there was a draft Bill and the Government, including Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Ministers, solemnly passed this proposal which resulted in a Bill being brought before the House. That such a draft provision could be produced totally demolishes the reputation Fianna Fáil Ministers are supposed to have of being hard-headed political realists.  It also demolishes the reputation of Progressive Democrats Ministers as being enlightened thinkers and mould breakers because they conspired in the production of a daft provision of that <Col N="28" /> kind.  In securing the deletion of this nonsensical provision &mdash; the Progressive Democrates should bear this in mind &mdash; Seanad Éireann has again amply vindicated itself.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of important provisions about the preparation of the electoral register &mdash; the Minister mentioned these today.  The importance of accuracy in the register was also mentioned. The Minister of State today, and Deputy O'Hanlon in the Seanad last February, spoke about this matter.  The reflections of Deputy O'Hanlon on the accuracy of the register were repeated by the Minister of State today.  The ESRI published a report entitled &ldquo;A Statistical Analysis of the Irish Electoral Register and its use for Population Estimation and Sample Serveys in 1986&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Hanlon stated last February that the report shows that our register compares not unfavourably with the standard elsewhere &mdash; a curious use of words.  He said that the report concluded that it has certain deficiencies which we have documented but for most research purposes these are neither as serious nor as widespread as anecdotal evidence might suggest. Deputy O'Hanlon, who was never a man to pass up a good platitude, and the more pious the better, went on to say: &ldquo;However, there is no room for complacency and we must seek ways of securing substantial improvement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not interested in the value of our electoral register for population estimation and sample surveys.  My interest in it is: does it ensure that the citizen has the right to vote to which he or she is entitled.  No amount of congratulation about the usefulness of our register for sample surveying and population estimation will be of the slightest value to the citizen who finds that he or she has been denied a vote by some deficiency in the preparation of the register.  For that reason I generally welcome the measures contained in this Bill to improve the preparation of the register and, indeed, to bring forward the process for its preparation.</P>
    <P>There may well be a good deal to be said for excluding from the Christmas <Col N="29" /> holiday season the period during which parties and their activists consider the draft register, but the fact remains that the period for the preparation of the register as set out in the Bill, which commences on 1 September, still spans the Christmas period.  That would complete the process in a shorter period than is currently the case.  Questions of detail can be teased out on Committee Stage but I would ask the Minister to consider whether it would be worthwhile to start the process earlier so that it could be completed by Christmas, before the interruption in normal activities.  I see no compelling reason to have the new register come into effect on any particular date, either 15 April as is the case at present or 15 February as proposed in the Bill.  If we are looking for a date I would ask why not 1 January of any year, and let us begin the procedure for revision of the register accordingly at an earlier date than is proposed?</P>
    <P>I can understand that the question of giving publicity to the preparation of the register might not be an appropriate one for inclusion in a Bill of this kind but it is nevertheless a matter that needs to be addressed very seriously.  Despite our best efforts as Members of this House, the best efforts of party activists, local authority staff and all the people involved, we all come across cases in every election of people who are indignant because having slipped through the net they find, on polling day they are not included on the register and cannot vote. That is the case in spite of what I acknowledge to be extensive advertising by the Department of the Environment in the mass media at the material times.  I welcome the fact that a much greater accent has been put on television advertising in this connection in recent years, and the campaigns have been quite eye catching but there still remain indignant citizens. I would ask the Minister to consider the campaigns and whether they are having the impact they should have.  I am sure the Minister, and Deputy Kavanagh, would agree that many people never see the advertisements and are unaware that <Col N="30" /> there is a procedure that will ensure their entitlement to vote.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that allows electors to make their case for inclusion in the register up to 12 days before polling day.  I commend the Seanad and the Minister who responded to this point and reduced the period from the 21 days originally proposed to 12 days, as is in the Bill.  I also welcome the proposal to produce supplements to the electoral register, but only on the condition that they are simply what that word implies and do not replace the publication of a full and complete register.  A provision that concerns me is in section 16 which suggests that consideration might be given to the publication of a list of additions and a list of deletions to the draft register.  This provision, and the suggestion that it might be generalised if the Minister found it worked reasonably well in given areas, should be dropped.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about consolidation legislation, and the same idea of consolidation and up-dating applies by analogy to the preparation of the register. There is no substitute for a complete and up-to-date register.  The whole electoral process would become a nightmare if instead of having a full and up-to-date register we had an out-of-date register with a whole series of electors' lists constituting additions to or deletions from a register that might be several years old. I hate to think what the position would be if candidates and canvassers were going around with a register several years old and attached to it a sheaf of lists of additions and deletions.  I shudder to think what the job of personation agents on polling day might be if that kind of register existed.  I ask the Minister to delete that provision and give up any idea of conducting pilot surveys as to whether this procedure might be better than the production every year of a complete and up-dated register.</P>
    <P>I welcome the clarification in this Bill that an elector can be registered only once and in only one constituency or polling area.  Where a question of option arises as in the case of the Garda Síochána, members of the Defence Forces and, <Col N="31" /> indeed students, persons who have more than one residence, the voter should be given the choice as to where to register but should then have to stick with that choice during the currency of the register in question.</P>
    <P>I am a bit puzzled by the provisions in section 20 for the application of penalties to registration authorities which, in the Minister's view, do not carry out their jobs properly.  On Committee Stage there should be a clearer definition of how the Minister will decide whether they are carrying out their job properly.  It seems to be unfair to penalise a registration authority if they are seen to have a higher proportion than normal of people who did not bother to be included on the register.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Bill proposes to remove the requirement that an applicant for entry on the special voters' list must produce a medical certificate each year for continued inclusion on the register. It was an insulting requirement and, if possible, should be dropped even in relation to the first application.  However, I am still worried that the Bill provides that a registration authority &mdash; the Minister said it again this morning &mdash; would be entitled to require such a certificate in relation to any subsequent application where the registration authority considered this necessary.  The Minister gave the example of a voter who moves from one constituency or electoral area to another. If a person has been included in the list of special electors anywhere in the country that person should retain the same right if he or she moves to any other part of the country and it is perfectly in keeping with the logic of the provision that deletes the requirement for an annual certificate.  If we pass such a law in this House I cannot see any reason for allowing registration authorities to second guess our decision.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the issue of the entitlement of polling station staff to vote is dealt with in the Bill and I should like an assurance that the Bill will entitle every person employed in the polling stations on polling day to exercise the franchise. <Col N="32" /> That seems to be the case in relation to poll clerks but I am not sure it applies to presiding officers.  That issue should be addressed as presiding officers, people in whom we place a great deal of trust on election day, should not be deprived of the right to vote.  Will the Minister consider this matter before proceeding further with the Bill?</P>
    <P>Having mentioned the entitlement of polling station staff to vote, I should also like to touch on the matter of their appointment.  Section 95 of the Bill provides that the returning officer shall, on request, permit either candidates or their agents to inspect the list of persons who are appointed &mdash; or whom it is proposed to appoint &mdash; to carry out functions in the polling stations.  I am not sure of the intention of this provision because it simply allows the returning officer to show them the list.  Does it mean that candidates, prospective candidates or their agents are entitled to offer suggestions to the returning officer as to who might be appointed?  If so, why does the provision not explicitly say so?  Again, if that is the case, does the returning officer have to act on any such suggestion?</P>
    <P>I am sure that other Members of the House have found, as I have, that there is a certain amount of annoyance at every election in relation to the appointment of officers &mdash; or to be more accurate, the non-appointment as officers &mdash; of persons who are otherwise unemployed and suitable for appointment.  I do not mean any disrespect to any of the people who carry out those jobs on election day at election after election but the fact remains that people find it galling to see employed neighbours working in this capacity on election day while they remain unemployed. If the purpose of the provision in the Bill is to help us to deal with that, it should be clarified because it is not evident from a reading of the Bill that that is its intention.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the deposit to be lodged by or on behalf of a candidate should be increased from £100 to £500, which was a matter of considerable debate in the Seanad.  I am sure that, as long as there is a requirement for a <Col N="33" /> deposit &mdash; as I believe there should be &mdash; there will be an argument about the appropriate level.  The Minister pointed out that a sum of £100 in 1923 would be worth a sum of £3,000 in today's money. He said, in that context, to increase the deposit to £500 seems very reasonable.  I do not think so because a lot has changed in the intervening period of 69 years. For example, a proposal today to fix the deposit at £3,000 would be rightly condemned. It is obvious that we have a very different view today of the ease of access which people should have to our election system from the view which obtained in 1923.  I am in favour of securing the greatest possible access for every citizen to the electoral process.  I accept the need for a deposit but I do not think it should be a figure which would deter anybody from running.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister and other people to say that any worthwhile candidate will be able to get enough people together to raise £500.  However, that is a bit disingenuous.  When you compare the cases of a number of candidates &mdash; they may even be party candidates in an election &mdash; if £400 is provided for transporting the candidate to different areas, it means that if this Bill is passed the money will have to go towards the deposit, even if it is refundable, and it could be a material factor in helping that candidate to run a decent campaign.  The sum of £400 could be sorely missed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister being concerned about the possibility of frivolous candidates emerging. <Col N="34" /> However, we should place more trust in the electorate and in their ability to detect such frivolity.  While there have been rare cases of frivolous candidates &mdash; the Minister would remember a rather successful one not too many years ago &mdash; their incidence outside the party system in our electoral history has been very small indeed. Using a device like this very substantial hike in the deposit to get around it is not using the proper procedure.  I do not think that these cases of frivolity have been frequent enough to justify such a large deposit.</P>
      <P>However, I can think of very recent cases where a deposit might have made it difficult for a legitimate interest to be expressed.  In the 1989 election, for example, the National Army Spouses' Association ran four candidates on a very small budget.  They were perfectly entitled to do so and a deposit of £500 would have created quite a problem for a legitimate political interest to be expressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know all about it.  The provisions in section 147 of the Bill are intended to prevent obstruction of electors at polling stations on polling day and such provisions are long overdue.  I hope I will not offend any Member when I say that probably most of us from time to time have been guilty of that kind of conduct.  I suppose it is understandable, after three weeks of a fairly fraught election campaign, that in the emotion, tiredness and enthusiasm of the closing hours <Col N="35" /> of the campaign, we tend to let our enthusiasm get the better of our judgment and we forget our manners in relation to people coming to vote.  It is at moments like this when we have the tranquillity of spirit to think about such matters, that we can make sensible decisions about them.  Harassment of voters at polling stations should be brought to an end.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister made it clear both in the Seanad and here today that the 50 metre limit he refers to is to be counted from the outer boundary of the premises in which a polling station is situated. If that is so, that is fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that in the Seanad, and I hope he will repeat it at the end of this debate.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the extension of such a limit to 100 metres.  All of us can think of instances where a 50 metre ban would simply move the congregation, as the Minister calls it, down the street.  In rural areas, a 50 metre ban might move the crowed past the nearest pub, in which case the problem would be solved. However, in some urban areas 50 metres might not be sufficient to achieve the effect that the Minister, rightly, has in mind.</P>
      <P>I question only one part of that provision, the ban on the display of posters. There would be a case to provide that at every polling station a large enough space be made available to permit the display of a poster for each candidate in the election, without the attendant multitudes the Minister has in mind.  In the interests of information to the voter, a case could be made for the display of posters rather than have the hassle that goes on at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill produces, for no good reason I can discern, a very curious requirement that each voter should have to display to the presiding officer at the polling station the completed ballot paper folded so that the presiding officer is able to see the official mark on the paper before it is put <Col N="36" /> into the ballot box.  People will now be required to walk from the polling booth carrying a folded ballot paper and present themselves in front of the presiding officer, with the paper folded so that the officer can see the official mark, before putting their ballot paper into the ballot box.  Why has it been found necessary to have a proposal of that kind in the Bill? Such a provision may well cause great congestion and annoyance to voters, and in this regard I think particularly of the numbers of voters from 7 o'clock in the evening onwards in polling stations situated in populous urban districts and in polling stations in rural areas during the summer time, when people are kept busy with silage, hay and so on.  I do not understand why it was felt necessary to introduce a provision of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes clear the entitlement of candidates and their agents to be present at the counting of votes.  So far as I can tell, however, they are the only people who under the provisions of the Bill have a right to be present.  It seems that the admission of those we know as &ldquo;tally persons&rdquo; and spouses and friends of candidates is a matter to be left to the discretion of the returning officer, as is the provision of facilities so that they can actually see the papers as they are sorted and then counted.  I object to that matter being left solely to the discretion of the returning officer who may be under pressure because of the kind of premises available. It is necessary to have a more formal indication that that particular and hallowed part of our electoral tradition should be allowed to continue.  One could argue that we should all contain our souls in patience and wait until the returning officer, in the company of the candidates and their agents, has announced the result.  Indeed, that is the argument that would be made by a clinical, detached observer.  To be quite honest, however, flesh and blood would not be able to put up with that.  In any event, the information our activists get from looking at the results of boxes is information that is legitimately required in the political process.</P>
    <P>I note that these iniquitous provisions <Col N="37" /> limiting time for debate on these Bills, that I am unhappy to say are becoming more prevalent, leave me only two minutes more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to my time being so limited.  I have a few more points I want to make.</P>
      <P>Although I may be wrong, it seems that there are only two sections in the Bill that provide for orders to be made by the Minister under the provisions of this Bill to be required to come before the House and be the subject of a positive decision by the House before they can be passed.  In quite a few other instances regulations to be made by the Minister are given effect unless they are subsequently overturned by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  For matters such as this, that is a completely inappropriate way of making regulations that have an important effect on our electoral procedure and in other areas.  That is a hobbyhorse of mine and I shall come back to this issue on Committee Stage.  I invite the Minister to take a more enlightened view and bring matters before this House for decision, even if that means the adoption of a fairly summary procedure for considering them.  A positive decision by the House, one way or the other, is much preferable to a potentially negative decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other issues that might arise but there is one question I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister. I ask him to consider this matter for the convenience of people who carry out an important function at elections, namely, the personation agents, those inside the polling stations who act on behalf of the candidates.  We now intend to ban canvassing outside the polling stations and we should therefore liberate quite a number of party activists, who will not now spend their day outside. On the other hand, there are those who under the present regulations, except by special grace and favour of the returning officer, are obliged to spend the whole day inside the polling station acting as <Col N="38" /> personation agents.  It is provided under the Bill that they be allowed to leave the polling station only with the consent of the returning officer.  Now that we are releasing all those persons from the arduous task of canvassing outside, perhaps we should consider allowing the relief of personation agents inside the polling stations.  I know there are some people for whom that role is the breath of life &mdash; people who have acted as personation agents in every election since they were 15 years of age and who could not conceive of an election without doing that but there are others for whom the job represents quite a burden.  Perhaps we should build into the system a little leeway to help those people to make their contribution at less inconvenience to themselves.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome the provisions of the Bill.  I am opposed to the provision which proposes to increase the deposit, which I consider to be wrong.  It is my belief also that provisions in relation to the registration of electors could be further improved.  I hope some of those measures will be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the detailed work has already been done on this Bill in the Seanad.  It is appropriate, therefore, that I confine my main observations on the Bill at this stage to the principles behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I would have to make is that this debate takes place in the shadow of a reasonably imminent general election. It is obvious to anyone who has eyes to see it that the Government are in the grip of an internal paralysis.  It seems impossible for the Government parties to agree even on the time of day in some instances.  Inevitably, that state of paralysis will lead to a period of increasing instability and volatility, which will result in an election at any time.  If that election takes place in the near future &mdash; as seems likely &mdash; it will be carried out on the basis of constituency boundaries that were settled by the Boundary Commission and based on the 1986 census of population. That is despite the fact that a substantial <Col N="39" /> amount of information already available from the 1991 census shows that between 1986 and 1991 there was sufficient change in population trends to warrant the establishment of a new Boundary Commission. For example, in that time the population of Finglas, Dublin, has increased by 10.3 per cent, the population of Kildare has increased by 5.4 per cent and the population of Wicklow has increased by 3 per cent.  The population of Leinster as a whole has, therefore, increased slightly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy going to give back to me the strip of Kildare he took from me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to give anything, and that is why I am making the case that another Boundary Commission should be established.  I feel the people of Kildare and the people of Wicklow would prefer the boundary to be as it was, even if Kildare had to be split into two constituencies &mdash; something I am sure the Deputy would not really like. In any event, it is right because of the changes in population trends that a general election should not be held unless the arguments I make, on the basis of the 1986 census, are carried through.  In Munster there has been an overall decrease of 1.2 per cent, in Connacht the decrease is 2 per cent and in the three counties of Ulster there has been a decrease of almost 2 per cent as well.  It is clear that there have been decreases in Cork city and Limerick city but in Galway city there has been a significant increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information is not yet available on the detailed breakdown on a constituency by constituency basis but it is reasonable to assume that some constituency changes at least will be warranted by the publication of that information &mdash; which should be available in a few weeks.  In turn, that raises the constitutional issue of whether an election can be validly held on the basis of out of date constituency boundaries.  In my view, there is an onus on the Government to announce clearly &mdash; and in the context of this debate it is <Col N="40" /> appropriate that they should do so &mdash; the moment the census figures become available that a boundary commission will be established with the view to making any necessary changes in constituency boundaries.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that there is a clear commitment in the review of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Programme for Government that this will be done and that the new boundary commission will have the same terms of reference as the previous one.  The same review of the Programme for Government promised a comprehensive paper on the issue of voting rights for emigrants together with a decision by the Government before Christmas of 1991.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting, when commenting on the absence of any progress in relation to this issue, that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is already on record on that issue.  Speaking in November 1991 she said: &ldquo;Surely for the sake of those people forced to leave this country and to ensure their continuing input into Ireland's development we should now commit ourselves to tackling the problems of extending the franchise and to following the example of the United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and shortly Italy, and extend the vote to our emigrant population.  It is the least we could do for them and something we should do for ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure I could not express a more eloquent view in support of the right of emigrants to maintain their link for a reasonable period in the democratic process of the land of their birth.  Of course, eloquence is not enough because the same Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, together with the rest of her party, combined with Fianna Fáil to vote down the Labour Party Bill on that issue.  That Bill was a reasoned and considered attempt to deal with the issue.  The Labour Party expressed themselves then, as we still do, as being willing to make whatever reasonable compromises are necessary to ensure a franchise for emigrants that would be supported at home and which would not have an <Col N="41" /> undesirable distorting effect on the outcome of an election.  There are many different models that can be considered. The pity is that so far this Government have turned their face against the principle.</P>
    <P>One wonders sometimes what principle means to senior Fianna Fáil figures. It seems they can say one thing at home and quite a different thing when they are talking to emigrants abroad.  For example, on 18 March 1992, speaking in Washington, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, said that at the end of the day it is not an unreasonable expectation that emigrants recently left the country should hope for a vote.  The same Minister in a letter to Irish Emigrant Vote Campaign on 31 October 1991 &mdash; when he was not Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; said: &ldquo;I enclose the up-to-date Programme for Government between the Coalition partners and I am glad to note it will be the intention to grant the vote to the Irish emigrants.&rdquo; The same view has been expressed in writing by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, but at that time when she was not a member of the Government.</P>
    <P>Why is it always the case that Fianna Fáil are capable of saying one thing when they are not in a position to deliver but take a different view when they are in a position of power?  The Bill before the House will continue to be defective unless it deals with this issue in a reasoned and considered way.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, a number of other important issues in the Bill but many opportunities have been missed.  I would like to refer to a point made previously which deals with the consideration given in the Bill to the increase in the deposit for Dáil candidates from £100 to £500. While I fully recognise the purpose of this provision is to reduce the number of frivolous candidates taking part in Irish elections, we have been very lucky in this respect in Ireland.  We have only to look at the elections in the United Kingdom where candidates of varying shades of eccentricity take part in every election to recognise that in the main Irish elections <Col N="42" /> are fought by parties and individuals with serious agendas.  It ought to be the democratic right of every citizen to contest an election, as an Independent, if they wish or through the party system.  Democratic norms suggest that unreasonable obstacles should not be placed in the way of such candidacy.  Many candidates will be seriously inhibited by a £500 deposit.  I believe that consideration ought to be given to reducing that sum and I hope we will get an opportunity to do that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill contains provisions that would inhibit political activity outside polling stations on election day. This is welcome as far as it goes.  It has long been an undesirable feature of Irish elections, from the point of view of the electorate in particular, that voters are forced to run the gauntlet of competing political parties who are determined to advertise themselves outside the polling station.  All political parties feel obliged to do this and, therefore, all political parties will continue to hear the refrain from voters that their minds are already made up.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity for us to consider seriously whether we ought to follow the example of a number of other countries and establish a moratorium period for 24 hours only before polling in respect of all political activity.  I include the taking of polls in that 24 hour period. The idea of producing an opinion poll on the morning of the election &mdash; before people go to vote telling them the result of the election &mdash; can be dangerous as I know from my colleagues in the British Labour Party.  It can give a false impression as to the level of the electoral support which one can have.</P>

      <P>I make the point that, while opinion polls can give an overall impression of the strength of the parties, it is wrong they should come out on the morning of an election saying what the result is; mine is often very different, I am glad to say.  In the past we had a distorted version of what the election result would be.  In any event, since opinion polls cannot determine the transfers between candidates at later counts, they cannot be accurate about the total polls for individual parties.  As we all know &mdash; and some of us are very glad to know &mdash; we can get votes from other parties when they are badly needed.  I can recall two occasions when I was very happy to receive a reasonable transfer of votes and I was able to continue my term in the House.</P>

      <P>It is reasonable that there should be a moratorium for a short period, rather than for a 24 hour period as happened in the French election.  There is a lot of useful work that tired candidates and workers can do in the last 24 hours before the poll takes place but there always seems to be that last minute letter push, or something like that.  A weary electorate can become very annoyed with continuous stroke politics to catch the eye at the last minute.  It seems to me the Irish electorate are one of the most sophisticated electorates in the world; they are capable on every occasion of making very difficult and elaborate <Col N="44" /> decisions.  Our legislation should reflect that fact.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with a few points which struck me as I looked through the Bill.  I very much welcome the proposal to update the register of electors to the latest possible date.  It is one of the great faults and weaknesses of our system that people for one reason or another &mdash; perhaps they are tardy in indicating they have reached the voting age or that they have moved to another area &mdash; are unable to vote.  On election day they become very annoyed with politicians who, strictly speaking, do not have responsibility for this task.  Politicians do their best to see that the register is kept up to date and the changes in this regard being proposed in the Bill are very welcome.</P>
      <P>I cannot say I welcome the proposed changes in relation to postal voting because they do not go far enough.  There are three seaports in my constituency. Sailors and officers who work on board ships have been continuously denied a postal vote.  I hope an appropriate provision will be included in the Bill which will allow commercial travellers and other people who for one reason or another may not be in their constituencies on election day to vote.  I should like that latitude to be given to such people and not merely confined to gardaí and members of the Civil Service who are posted abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach adopted towards students is far more sinister.  It is estimated that 35,000 students live away from home.  Under this Bill they will have to give one address only.  Most of the students from my constituency, the area I know best, attend universities and colleges in Dublin or as far away as Waterford and Carlow.  One would question whether students should be able to block vote in a particular area or whether they should be forced into making a decision between the area in which the college is located or the area where they live.  I believe they should be given a postal vote and be entitled to make a choice between the two areas.  As we know, certain constituencies have returned more liberal Members due to the fact that colleges are <Col N="45" /> located there.  I do not think the Government should be afraid of that fact. Students should be given this choice rather than continuing the nonsensical system whereby cars and buses have to cross the mountains in Wicklow to get to the Carlow Regional College so that a few students, who may or may not be interested, can be brought home to vote. It is a nonsense to expect young boys and girls who are studying for examinations to be dragged back home during the middle of the week and thereby lose some of their study time when they could be given a postal vote.</P>
    <P>Changes have been suggested in relation to the method of election.  I believe my party are happy with the PR system; we hope that suggestions about a single non-transferrable vote and the like are merely figments of someone's imagination.  As can be seen, it is not always necessary for one party to have an overall majority; some parties in coalitions have worked very well.  The PR system has worked well not only in Ireland but in many countries in the European Community.  Parties can work well together in Government.  The PR system ensures that no party holds a hugely dominant position.  I hope proposals in regard to the single non-transferrable vote and multi-seat constituencies will not be put forward during the course of the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am always amazed that in spite of all the new technology and the new products which have come on the market that we still use the same old ballot boxes.  One needs to have some dexterity when applying sealing wax to these old rusty tin boxes.  As far as I know, sealing wax is used only in old solicitors' offices.  Can we not follow the example of other democracies and use transparent boxes with new locking mechanisms?  The chief superintendent or county registrar could have a key to the box so that once it is closed no one can interfere with it.  It is time we moved on from using these old tin boxes with locks which can be opened with a bent pin.  These boxes are left lying around in trucks and halls all night &mdash; I <Col N="46" /> know that gardaí are assigned to look after them.  Surely it is time we modernised the type of box we use.  Instead of requiring people to hold up their ballot papers to show they are stamped properly, they could drop them into a perspex box so that one could see the number of votes cast.  This is the type of box used in many progressive countries.  I hope we are a progressive country and that we take that system on board.  Some of the boxes we use go back to the time of the foundation of the State or maybe even before it.  I hope we can replace them. Perhaps the Minister of State will think about that suggestion.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill that a poll may continue for up to 14½ hours &mdash; I think the maximum time is between 8 a.m. and 10.30 p.m.  I hope we keep the 12 hours limit.  I have found that someone will always be late casting their vote and there will always be a last minute rush.  Even if another hour was given at the end of the day I do not think it would make any difference to the turnout.  In some cases only 5 per cent of the electorate may vote in five hours and there is suddenly a big rush at the end of the day. I do not think an extra hour at the end of the day will increase the percentage from 72 per cent or 73 per cent to 80 per cent.  We should accept that the closing time of 9 p.m. is reasonable.  As I said earlier, those who cannot make it to the polling station should be accommodated under the postal voting system.</P>
    <P>An organisation has been pushing for a number of years for ballot papers to carry pictures of the candidates.  Some years ago I thought that idea was something of a nonsense.  However, many people who attend reading and writing classes do not want it to be known at election time that they are illiterate.  They may spoil a ballot paper rather than ask a friend, relation or the presiding officer to help them fill it in.  Having pictures of the candidates on ballot papers would be of help to such people, particularly if, by coincidence, two candidates have the same name.  This proposal should be given some consideration and perhaps it can be referred to on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> I wonder when we will settle on a time limit for local elections.  It is appropriate that this point should be mentioned now. We still have not heard from the Minister &mdash; he had the opportunity to tell us today &mdash; whether elections to urban district councils and town commissioners will be held next year.  They have been promised but I do not know whether they will take place.  It is crazy to have a seven year period between the holding of local elections; the maximum period between the holding of local elections should be five years.  The electorate in local elections is small and it should not be a great problem to hold them.  Of course, there is a question mark over the approach of the Government to local democracy in that respect.  The Minister will probably tell us whether he is going to leave the boundaries as they were on the last occasion or whether they will be changed.  I hope he will avail of the opportunity to clear up any doubts in that regard.  Many people believe democracy loses its effect if the same people are let run our towns over a long period.  I hope a date will be given for the holding of the local elections.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Dukes about the 50 metres limit outside polling stations.  As I have said, some improvements had to be made in this regard.  However, I envisage that before polling stations open we will need a measuring tape to find out where we can move to and get a definition of where the polling station starts.  My own polling station is the Dominican Convent in Wicklow.  One has to drive about 40 yards to the polling station from where I live, so I would like to know if the polling station is the Dominican Convent or the polling station itself.  If it is the convent, that comprises at least 50 acres of land which would mean that one could find oneself as far out as Brittas Bay on one end of the polling station or perhaps one hundred yards away from it in another direction.</P>

      <P>Not in a winter election which we probably will have.  I find it cold enough in Brittas Bay in the summer.  We must address that particular proposal so that before the next general election we can decide exactly how we should operate. There is only one argument that I would make concerning attendances outside polling stations.  I believe that if people, while voting, did not see canvassers outside the polling station, they might feel that there was a lack of interest.  In British general elections the polling stations appear to be very quiet, which might imply a very dull election, but on the other hand what I have seen happening in Bray, where people are actually jostled while trying to enter the polling stations, is not useful either. There is a need for this problem to be addressed and we should give it more consideration at the time of the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I make a very strong plea that we set up a special committee of the House to deal with the Committee Stage of this Bill.  It is a very large Bill, comprising approximately 118 pages and over 170 sections.  My experience of the recent Housing Bill was that, having dealt with approximately one-third of that Bill, it was guillotined, with the result that many important sections were overlooked during the cut and thrust of Committee Stage.  We are now dealing with an Electoral Bill and it is fair to say that almost everybody in this House is an expert and has an opinion and, therefore, I feel this Bill could be greatly improved by allowing it to be fully debated in a special committee of the House.  There was an outcry because of what happened to the Housing Bill and, subsequently, the Roads Bill was dealt with in committee. Some constituents thought we were on holidays during the summer but in fact we spent a couple of weeks working on that Bill which proved to be very worthwhile. Regarding this Bill, I would make a strong appeal that it be dealt with in a special committee and that the usual procedures are adopted to give full representation to all sides of the House.  If that is allowed to take place the result <Col N="49" /> will be a much better Bill.  Obviously, following Committee Stage the Bill will be returned to this House and any points of principle that cannot be agreed can be dealt with on Report Stage.  I hope the Bill will be dealt with by a special committee, and I believe we can, with generosity, improve the Bill a great deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister of State for his kind remarks in welcoming me to this specific duty in the Dáil.  I look forward to working closely and constructively with him and also to have the honour of joining such eminent people in the arena as Deputy Dukes and Deputy Kavanagh.</P>
      <P>By and large, Democratic Left welcome the Bill that is before the House but, unfortunately, it has a number of shortcomings that I believe could be addressed.  I know from reading the Seanad debate that the Minister of State and the Minister who moved the Bill there and who has now moved on from that portfolio, indicated that he would be receptive to suggestions that might be made on many aspects of the legislation. I hope that will be the attitude of the Minister of State, as I am sure it will, when considering amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation, by and large, is very good and for that reason I hope that we can make such progress as will facilitate the passing of this legislation into law before the holding of the forthcoming referendum that is proposed by the Government on the issues relating to travel, information and abortion which is scheduled for the first week in December. That cuts a little across Deputy Kavanagh's hope that this Bill would be dealt with in Special Committee from here.  It is very substantial legislation but, as he pointed out in his opening remarks, much work has been done in the Seanad in terms of improving and tidying up its provisions.  I would certainly like to see this legislation in place to regulate and control the way in which the referendum and the campaign leading up to the referendum in December is conducted because it seems to me, having regard <Col N="50" /> to the activities up to now of certain elements and groups on one particular side of the debate, who seem to think that the private homes and private lives of Deputies are open to attack, to bully into and, from what I understood of Deputy Fennell's position, to very intimidating attitudes towards her at her home, that we can expect a very tough campaign indeed, particularly those of us who would campaign for some form of legislation to facilitate abortion in limited circumstances in this country.</P>
    <P>In particular, the provisions in this legislation that would regulate the conduct of people outside polling stations would be very helpful indeed.  Whatever about general election days and people running the gauntlet, I believe there could be much more very unsavoury activity outside our polling stations on the referendum on these issues but this legislation will help the position.  I hope, therefore, that we can agree a speedy passage of this legislation through the House.  Much of its work has been done in the Seanad and I hope it will be in place in time to regulate the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    <P>This legislation is very welcome in itself.  It must be almost unique in terms of the type of work that is undertaken by this House by combining in one aspect of legislation all of the law relating to an aspect of our civil society.  It has managed to draw together the basic principles that can be found in 19 legislative measures going back as far as 1850 or thereabouts. It would have been very helpful &mdash; and perhaps the Minister of State would be able to inform the House &mdash; to have a little more of the work that was necessary to put this together.  In particular, the officials in the Department of the Environment and the Minister have to be congratulated for the work they did and I hope the views of this House will be conveyed to those who worked on this legislation in compiling and drafting it. For years many of us have been arguing in the general area of law reform itself and, in particular, the area of criminal law that we should have the law streamlined, codified and worked into one basic <Col N="51" /> item of legislation but time and again we have been told that it is much too cumbersome an undertaking, that resources are not available and that it would require too much effort to do this work.  Here is a classic example of what we have been talking about and would advocate, and so perhaps the Minister of State would advise the House on when the work first began, whose idea it was to initiate the project, when did it begin, and how long did it take to put together this codifying legislation.  It is very welcome in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, should have availed of the opportunity today to reaffirm Government belief in and support for the proportional representation voting system based on multi-seat constituencies, which has obtained here since the foundation of the State.  Such a statement is expected of Government because that system has proved to be extremely fair and a good working one.</P>
    <P>Going through some Press cuttings on this issue I noted that in November 1991 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, called publicly on people to seriously address the question of single seat constituencies.  I am particularly concerned about a Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Coalition being led by a Taoiseach who has made a clear statement that his task as Taoiseach is to lead Fianna Fáil back to single party Government. If that is his serious intent then the Taoiseach must have some regard to the electoral system.  It is fair to say that the system of proportional representation which has obtained since the foundation of the State will never again provide a single party majority Government here. Deputy Haughey was motivated in that direction and the Taoiseach, who apparently is motivated in the same direction, will I believe again tinker with the concept of single seat constituencies or with doing away with the proportional representation system, as Fianna Fáil endeavoured to do twice in the past.</P>
    <P>I would challenge the Minister of State, <Col N="52" /> when replying on behalf of the Government, to indicate where the Government stand in regard to a system which is recognised internationally to be a fair, workable and tested one.</P>
    <P>The concept built into other provisions of this Bill &mdash; with which I will deal in time &mdash; of endeavouring to obliterate minority of small parties, such as the one of which I am a member, is not healthy for our democracy.  It is vital that all shades of public opinion within our community be heard and represented on the Floor of this House.  Indeed, in investigating our overall electoral system, the Minister must realise &mdash; as no doubt he does &mdash; that on average up to 30 per cent of the electorate do not vote in general elections.  A sizable proportion of the electorate entitled to exercise their democratic right to vote opt out when it comes to decide who will govern this country, in what way, or what should be the electoral programme to be followed for the ensuing five years.  Indeed, the proportion of the electorate is less when it comes to local and European elections. For example, there are some constituencies, and wards within them, where the voting numbers will be as low as 50 per cent of the electorate.  I know of one polling station in my constituency where the percentage who voted was as low as 30 per cent in the local elections in 1985.</P>
    <P>In a Bill of this kind we should not only encourage people to participate in the voting system but also engender within that system a sense of confidence and integrity leading people to believe there is a place for them within it.  Any plans for exclusion simply for sectoral gain ultimately will mean that in the long run all of us will lose out.</P>
    <P>Working on the general principle of the need to encourage participation in the electoral system I contend a number of basic issues must be addressed, the first, on which Deputy Kavanagh touched, being the position of our emigrants. It is totally unacceptable that those who, through no fault of theirs &mdash; because of poor economic performance and Government policy at home &mdash; are <Col N="53" /> obliged to go abroad to work should be automatically disadvantaged, not entitled to vote in local, general or European elections.  In the case of the latter it is beyond comprehension, especially in the case of those who move within the EC &mdash; particularly bearing in mind this great union now being built within Europe &mdash; that an Irish national working in another European country is not given a say in which Irish representatives should be elected to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>That is just one example of the incomprehensible attitude of Government of refusing to address the voting position of our emigrants.  I contend their position could be built on to an even greater extent if one were seriously interested in ensuring that people involve themselves in the electoral process.  For example, I contend that anybody who has been forced to go abroad out of economic necessity for a period of five years or less must be given the right to address and comment on the performance of the political party or parties in Government who fail, within their political and/or economic programme, to ensure jobs for them at home.  Such people must be given an opportunity to cast their vote in at least one election subsequent to their departure from these shores.</P>
    <P>The question of postal votes generally has not been addressed in the Bill.  As I understand it, the Bill allows for members of the Garda Síochána to opt for being an ordinary voter on the register or, alternatively, to use the postal vote. The same facility is afforded members of the Defence Forces, the basic principle being recognised that they are rendering a service to the State and, in so doing, should not be disadvantaged through the location in which they may find themselves on polling day or by other demands being made of them by someone in higher authority.  Clearly a member of the Garda Síochána or a soldier given an order by a superior officer could not respond or refuse to carry out that order because he wished to vote.</P>
    <P>As others have said, there are a large number of non-security personnel working, <Col N="54" /> directly or indirectly for the good of the State, who, as a class, find themselves severely disadvantaged when it comes to exercising their franchise.  For example, fishermen in Howth in my constituency frequently approach me before or after polling day claiming that they will be or have been out on the high seas at their employer's command, weather conditions being such that fish were there to be caught.  The same would apply to sailors on ships travelling abroad.  That may not be as relevant today since the demise of Irish Shipping but, when people worked for a national shipping company they were not facilitated in casting their votes, which they should have been.  The same applies to nurses working unsocial hours in hospitals, who may be on night duty and would not find it easy to cast their vote within their non-working hours.  The same applies to travelling sales people who, in the course of their work, are taken from their constituencies.</P>
    <P>If we can devise rules for members of the Garda, Defence Force and sailors why cannot we devise the same rules for others who find themselves in a similar position on polling day?  I think, for example, of workers transferred to other locations as a result of Government decentralisation programmes who may travel backwards and forwards from their place of work to their abode.  For example, there are now many workers who travel daily from Dublin to Cork and other places and workers who travel from locations outside of Dublin to the city centre and back.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for more flexible usage of the postal voting system. I do not accept the proposition that, because of the nature of their work, one can trust one group of workers but not another since all serve the State directly or indirectly.  Nobody should be discommoded or denied a vote simply because they may have been absent at work on polling day.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the question of disabled voters.  I do not understand why the Bill retains the cumbersome system of requiring a member of the Garda and <Col N="55" /> a returning officer to go to a disabled person's home with a ballot paper.  It is an excessively cumbersome system representing a significant intrusion into such a person's home.  Why cannot disabled persons be given the facility of a postal vote once it has been certified that they are unable to travel beyond their home with ease?  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this.  In particular I would ask him to examine his introductory remarks with regard to disabled voters.</P>
    <P>I welcome the removal of the obnoxious provision which required people with a physical or other disability to produce a certificate showing that they were of sound mind.  That was preposterous, whoever thought of it.  It shows an incredible nervousness within the Department or on the part of the Minister, which is reflected in this legislation, in regard to being more flexible, drawing people in and making it more easy for them to participate in the electoral system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that the requirement in relation to sound mind may give offence to some disabled persons and that the requirement of an annual medical certificate could cause inconvenience and possible expense.  The Minister suggested that such provision may give offence; it absolutely did so.  It offended and insulted all disabled persons. That is why the Minister is removing the requirement in this legislation. I would ask him to go further and to investigate the possibility of securing Government approval to accommodate the use of the postal vote in this area.  It is far more straightforward and casts no reflection on the integrity of the disabled voter.  It certainly would save the Government a considerable amount of expense in paying for the time of gardaí and other personnel.  I should like to hear from the Minister, if he proposes to allow the legislation as drafted to stand, any facts and figures with regard to the number of personnel employed, the number who seek to use the disabled vote and the expense incurred on the day of <Col N="56" /> an election in trying to accommodate the provisions of the legislation which exists.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision whereby the voter must opt for one address, if that voter has the right of address in more than one constituency.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the views of Deputy Dukes with regard to the deposit provision.  I interjected when he was speaking because I was concerned that the spokesperson for Fine Gael in the Seanad had argued for the deposit of £1,000 and had not advanced any reason. I would hope that the Government would take into account the attitude shown by the three parties in this House on this issue.</P>
    <P>Participation is what it is all about.  The unemployed came from all 32 counties to march in Dublin yesterday and to express their dissatisfaction.  The message must not be lost that politicians who turned up to participate were not allowed at the front of the march and were not invited to address the rally when it assembled in O'Connell Street.  The unemployed feel let down by politicians and that the electoral system as represented by the two Houses of the Oireachtas has little to offer in any meaningful way.  There is a lesson to be learned.  That section of the community are substantially represented in the 30 per cent who do not vote in elections.  If we say we are about to impose a further restriction on their participating in the system, in the long run we will be the losers.</P>
    <P>The simple proposition put forward to justify the increase is that £100 in 1923 would be equivalent to £3,000 today, but that is proof of nothing.  We legislate for conditions that apply at a given time.  The argument is now being advanced that the device of increasing the deposit to £500 is to allow the Government to weed out irrelevant candidates.  There is a degree of arrogance involved in that concept which is not healthy in people who are in pursuit of a democratic system that works.  Who is to say that any other person is irrelevant?  Who is to tell the thousands who marched in Dublin yesterday that they are irrelevant simply because they see no role for themselves <Col N="57" /> within the electoral system directly?  It is argued that the voter must be entitled to make a decision without the distraction of non-relevant candidates.  That is arrogant in concept and gives little or no benefit to the voter.</P>
    <P>We must work to encourage people into the system and to see that election to the Dáil or Seanad is a worthwhile objective in pursuit of a particular viewpoint or end.  I do not want to single out a Deputy but one could argue that Deputy Foxe is in some way irrelevant because he was presented at the last general election as a single issue candidate. He is not a member of a political party and he is pursuing a specific item.  Perhaps he is an irrelevancy in the cosy party political system we seem to want in this institution, which is perceived outside to be no more than a club.  We must be extremely careful about that.  Every Irish citizen who is prepared to put up a reasonable deposit of £100 should be entitled to come forward.  Public opinion would police the system and the reaction which people meet campaigning on doorsteps.</P>
    <P>The British phenomenon of people coming forward with crazy names and crazy manifestoes is a direct product of the single seat constituency organisation which substantially alienates large sections of opinion from the electoral system.  I would have great difficulty in knowing where to fit into the electoral system in Britain when the choice is between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party.  Nobody else would seem to be a possible parliamentary force.  I feel for the 15 per cent or 20 per cent of people who voted Green and did not manage to secure one seat in parliament.</P>
    <P>We must be careful not to be seen to alienate and disenfranchise people unwittingly. The notion that we can describe people as irrelevant and scratch their names off the ballot paper so that voters will not be distracted is very dangerous. If it is the motivation behind the increase in the deposit from £100 to £500, I would ask the Minister to change his mind and to leave the deposit as it stands.  It has been at that level since 1923 and we have <Col N="58" /> never had a rash of irrelevant or distracting candidates on the ballot paper. Why change it when it has worked so well for so long?</P>
    <P>I welcome any effort to eradicate difficulties outside polling stations.  In 1977 I watched two warring factions of the same political party literally fight it out, poster for poster, foot for foot and inch for inch, over who should represent the party &mdash; not the Minister's party &mdash; outside that polling station.  It was outrageous. The way to deal with this problem is to ban all canvassing and electioneering on polling day and, perhaps, the day before.  There should be a respite at the end of a campaign for voters to reflect on the issues and arguments put forward over the previous two to four weeks before making their measured judgment.</P>
    <P>I had the honour, with two other Deputies and a Senator, to travel to Chile in 1988 to see off the great and obnoxious dictator, Pinochet, in a constitutional referendum. It was remarkable to see the way in which that country, which had been deprived of the democratic process for many years, appreciated the return to normality and the right to vote.  There was no electioneering on the day before polling or on polling day.  A public holiday was declared to enable people to go to the polling stations to vote and this was done in a very ordered and dignified manner.  There is a great deal to be learned from that.  We should declare polling day a public holiday in order to allow people to vote in a general election. A general election is held approximately every four years and it would not be a big concession to give people the day off work to allow them move with ease to a polling station free from all distractions of people shouting names and shoving literature at them.  That is the way to go forward and I ask the Minister to adhere to the existing provisions in the legislation.  I suggest that he increase the distance in which canvassers may operate to at least 100 metres from the polling stations.  There should be no placing of posters on polling day although the <Col N="59" /> suggestion has been made that we allow some.  If we provide an exception to the limit of the distance people will argue their right to put up posters and attend to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one other aspect of the election process which has not been addressed.  The Minister of State said that the surname and Christian name will be on the ballot paper.  I am sure the Minister is aware of deed polls being lodged in the High Court some days before an election as a mechanism to work party political or campaign issues into a surname.  That issue should be dealt with in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The legislation proposes to maintain the age at which a candidate may be elected at 21 years.  However, we allow people of 18 years to participate in the electoral process and consider them adults for all other aspects of the law. Therefore, people of 18 years of age should be entitled to stand as candidates for Dáil Éireann.  It is about time we had younger people putting forward the views of their contemporaries in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when moving the Bill in the Seanad, said it was important to streamline the legislation to ensure it would not be controlled by experts and lawyers.  In my first election to Dáil Éireann I was the victim &mdash; if I might say so &mdash; of an overnight recount because a son of a certain esteemed Deputy had run a close second to me.  I arrived at the polling station the following day to meet three learned members of the Law Library who had many books with them, to act on his behalf.  That brought home to me for the first time just how hairs can be split and how legal arguments run in this whole area.  To the extent that the Bill helps to streamline and bring the electoral process within the understanding and control of people generally, it is very welcome and I commend the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Though largely a consolidation measure, this Bill contains a number of significant improvements to our electoral law and <Col N="60" /> does much to simplify and improve access to the electoral process.  Basically, this is what we are all trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>At its base, we should view electoral law as enabling the exercise of a fundamental right, the right of members of society to make a contribution to decisions affecting that society.  In considering legislation such as this, it is easy for professional representatives to fall into the trap of looking at the whole issue purely in terms of trying to make our lives easier.  In fairness the Bill does not fall into that trap as it sets as its objective unhindered access to the polling process. However, many areas of the Bill can be improved and a different perspective might make its intentions clearer.  I would like to devote most of my time to what I see as the three principles of the Bill, first, the registration of electors; second, the candidates' deposits and, third, canvassing in the vicinity of polling stations.</P>
      <P>In relation to the register of electors, the registration process, when working properly, should ensure as far as possible that every person over 18 years who is not specifically disqualified due to criminality, is in a position to exercise their right to vote.  At present our system is quite restrictive and in comparison to some other countries is somewhat inflexible. Therefore, I am glad the Bill provides some element of flexibility in allowing as many qualified persons as possible to cast their vote on election day.  In the United States people are still registering to vote in the Presidential election although the election is only one month away.  In North Dakota there is no register and voters have only to turn up on 5 November to prove their right to vote.  I am not recommending that we should have such a system here, but it shows the flexibility that exists in other countries.  For a number of reasons that would be impracticable here, we do not have fixed dates for elections and the principle of enabling each candidate to reach a qualified voter through the postal system is one of the rights of candidates in elections here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies welcome the introduction of a supplementary register. <Col N="61" /> It will make a significant contribution towards correcting errors.  I am sure every Deputy can refer to many instances of people complaining to him or her on or after polling day about being left off the register.  People who might have been on the register for years find on polling day they are not on it.  The supplementary register is an excellent idea as it will include those people who have been on the register for many years and through some error were left off at the time of registration.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to those who reach 18 years of age after the qualifying date of 1 September.  If a person is 18 years on 2 September it may mean that he or she may have to wait 16 months before they are entitled to vote.  Perhaps, in future reform, we can include in the supplementary register not just people who are left off the register but also those coming up to the age of 18 years.  There are a number of ways in which this could be done.  They could simply be included in the supplementary register or the date that a person reaches the age of 18 years could be written beside their name on the register.  From that day they would be entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>A third suggestion &mdash; while this might be the least satisfactory of the three it might solve the problem &mdash; is that people who reach the age of 18 years between 1 September and 15 February, which is the date the new register comes into force, could be allowed to put their name on the register.  This is happening but it is not legal.  If people reach the age of 18 between 1 September and 15 February they should be able to register.  This is something that could be covered.  It is a pity that people could be 18 years of age and not have an opportunity to become involved in the democratic process for 16 months.</P>
    <P>Place of residence is very important.  In South County Meath many people move house and this phenomenon is particularly relevant in the Dublin area.  It is relevant also in many urban areas and in areas where there is an increase in population.  Houses change hands frequently and the people on the move are <Col N="62" /> not catered for in the supplementary register.  They should be catered for. People who move, for instance, from Donegal to Dublin should not have to return to Donegal to register but should be able to use a supplementary register. A register should be established each year and people should be able to add their names to it throughout the year. With computerisation it should be possible to produce a full register within three days of the calling of an election.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to special voters.  I warmly welcome the change in the registration process for special voters. It was outrageous that special voters had to be certified as being sound of mind and produce a medical certificate every year confirming their disability.</P>

      <P>The Government's White Paper on Marriage Breakdown which was published last week says that the Government will hold a referendum on divorce after a full debate on the issues, and following the enactment of other proposals on Family Law which are outlined in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>As to issues arising from the Supreme Court decision in the case of Attorney General <i>v.</i> X, the Government have decided that the three issues, namely travel, information and the substantive issues, will be dealt with by referenda, to be held on 3 December 1992.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government are pleased that the political dialogue between the Irish and British Governments and the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland is continuing.  We are, of course, committed firmly to the talks which, as the House is aware, seek to achieve a new beginning in the relationships within Northern Ireland; within the island of Ireland; and between the peoples of Britain and Ireland.  The Government view the talks as offering the potential for the people of these islands finally to bridge the divide across historical antagonisms which have brought so much bitterness and pain to ordinary men and women in our different countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My strongest hope is that the talks will be used by the participants in the full consciousness that the people of Northern Ireland cannot be asked to bear another 23 years of violence.  The talks must be about peace rather than Protocol and procedures.  Deputies will be aware that the talks, while in progress, are subject to the rule of confidentially which the Irish side has observed at all times. However, I can say that the talks resumed with a Strand Two sub-committee meeting in Belfast on 1 September and, at the <Col N="68" /> plenary session on the following day, it was agreed that much of the work should be done within a committee with a reduced number of delegates from each group.  The Strand Two discussions have continued since then, including three days of meetings in Dublin, and have worked steadily through the agenda originally agreed on 1 July by all the parties. The second meeting of Strand Three took place in London on 11 September.  The Irish and British Governments continued their work on the Strand Three agenda and agreed to propose an early liaison meeting on Strand Three issues with the other four parties to the process.  This meeting took place in Belfast on 16 September. The third meeting of Strand Three took place in Dublin on 22 September.</P>
    <P>As to Articles 2 and 3, I need not recall here the reason for their place in our Constitution.  With Article 29, they reflect a view widely and deeply held by Irish people everywhere.</P>
    <P>The talks process mirrors this historical reality and seeks to balance the many elements within and between each of the three central relationships.  In short, the Government support and advocate the agreed position of the constitutional Nationalist parties of Ireland as set out in paragraph 5.2.4 of the Report of the New Ireland Forum &mdash; namely, that both the Nationalist and Unionist identities must have equally satisfactory, secure and durable expression and protection in the political, administrative and symbolic domains.</P>
    <P>As part of this approach, the Government have consistently said that Articles 2 and 3 must be treated with reference to other constitutional positions which include the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.</P>
    <P>As to consultation with Opposition party leaders, I said last April and on 1 July in this House that I will keep the Leaders of the main parties informed confidentially of the progress of the talks from time to time.</P>
    <P>At our meeting in London on 25 September, the British Prime Minister and I discussed a range of issues including <Col N="69" /> European Community matters, particularly preparations for the special meeting of the European Council to be held on 16 October, progress in the three-stranded talks process, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and other issues of common interest to our two countries.</P>
    <P>We discussed the prospects for ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and the wider agenda of ongoing Community business to be taken forward under the British Presidency.  We agreed that the Community should also proceed with other crucial business, including the completion of the Single Market and the negotiations on the future financing of the Community and preparations for enlargement.</P>
    <P>On Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister and I reviewed the talks and we pledged the continuing support of our two Governments to the process.  We confirmed our commitment to the full implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, including the principle of holding regular and frequent meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. We also reaffirmed our readiness to consider a new and more broadly-based agreement or structure if such an agreement can be arrived at through direct discussion and negotiation between all the parties concerned.  In order to facilitate the talks process, a second and final extension of the interval between Intergovernmental Conferences was agreed.  The next meeting of the Conference will take place on Monday, 16 November.</P>
    <P>At the meeting over lunch, the Prime Minister was accompanied by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, MP, and by the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr. Tristan Garel-Jones, MP.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Padraig Flynn.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is extremely important that an agreement be reached in the talks process and that, against the background of 3,000 deaths in Northern Ireland in the past 20 years, a breakdown in these talks would be a tragedy for this country? Would the Taoiseach agree that all parties must look not back but forward and must be generous in seeking to modify their own positions in order to accommodate others rather than looking to the historic justifications for their own positions? Would the Taoiseach agree that there is, therefore, a heavy responsibility on him as the representative of this State at this time to be flexible and show generosity in these discussions and not take the view that others must make the first move before he will make any?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that there is a heavy responsibility on me and indeed on everybody participating in this process to find a solution and the way we have seen for the past 23 years is not the way forward that any of us want to see for the next 23 years.  We have approached these talks very constructively and will continue to do so.  We hope and expect that everybody else will do the same and that with goodwill on all sides we will be able to make progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again urge the Taoiseach to consider the question of consultation or at least briefings for the Leaders of the Opposition parties in this House because the approach of all in this House in relation to these talks has been constructive.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the tenor of the discussions, particularly the leaks and incautious remarks, some of which verged on the antagonistic and the arrogant, have not been helpful. What we as participants in these discussions should be concentrating on are the areas of common ground and not the areas of division which seem to have bedevilled these talks.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will agree that all the participants have to be seen to be setting out to reconcile our differences not to entrench our <Col N="71" /> difficulties as has come across in the leaks that have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with what Deputy Spring said in relation to the leaks and the problems they have caused to these talks but we have not been responsible for these leaks.  I deplore them.  They are certainly doing more damage to the talks than helping the political views of a particular party or person.  I do not think that is the road to progress and it is not the way the rest of us want to travel.  I was delighted that despite very extreme provocation the talks continued in Dublin and have resumed in Belfast and that is the way we want to see them going forward.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the House should appreciate that the ground rules for these talks have been accepted by all the parties participating in them and there is no room for, nor would we accept, anybody trying to insert new conditions or preconditions to these talks as they go along. We all accepted the rules that were laid out in 1991 by the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke.  That is what everybody agreed and that is the basis on which the talks should continue.  We can all expect that from time to time there will be outbursts but what is important is that the talks should continue.</P>

      <P>In his initial reply the Taoiseach said that the objective of these talks was to bring about peace in Northern Ireland and that a vacuum in the political sense in Northern Ireland would only play into the hands of people who are not interested in peace.  The Nationalists in Northern Ireland feel that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is their guarantee and continuing postponements of meetings under that agreement are not conducive to building confidence among the Nationalist community.  Will the Taoiseach agree that no further meetings will be postponed and that the meetings will be held as laid down in the Anglo-Irish Agreement?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be assured that I fully recognise the importance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  In no way will I allow that it should be diminished in any way or that anybody should even think in terms of its being dismantled and thrown away.  I am sure the Deputy will also appreciate the many calls on me to ensure that the talks process was kept going in recent times.  I took a decision despite threats that the talks would break down if a definitive date were set for a meeting under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I regard the Anglo-Irish Agreement as highly important and it will stay in place unless a better agreement is forthcoming from these talks.</P>

      <P>If I understand the position correctly, Articles 2 and 3 are on the table in the talks that are taking place.  Would the Taoiseach therefore explain his statement in Tipperary on 26 September that Articles 2 and 3 are not for sale and that they are in good hands? Does this mean that the Taoiseach is withdrawing Articles 2 and 3 from the talks in Northern Ireland?  May I also ask the Taoiseach if he accepts that there can be no possible arrangement or solution in Northern Ireland without guaranteeing the democratic rights of all traditions in Northern Ireland and that, therefore, there has to be compromise on all sides if such a solution is to be found and that intransigent statements such as &ldquo;Articles 2 and 3 are not for sale&rdquo; only lead to concern and unease among those we are hoping will also compromise their position in order to reach an agreement? Finally, may I ask the Taoiseach if he would clarify what is meant by the statement in his reply today that Articles 2 and 3 reflect the views of all Irish people everywhere?

      <P>Suggestions have been made from many directions down here that Articles 2 and 3 should be changed and given away in advance of any movement in the talks.  This was asked for by certain people at the talks.  I want to make it clear to everybody that we go <Col N="75" /> along with the ground rules which were agreed by everybody involved in the talks, no more, no less and, consequently, every aspect of constitutional matters and of the Unionist and Nationalist identity are up for discussion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but may I ask the Taoiseach if that is meant to be taken as a time frame for a conclusion of the present talks or is it envisaged that the talks will continue beyond that date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a strong view that they should be given that period of time to try to advance from the position they were at and that it would take five to six weeks to do this.  The House <Col N="79" /> should recall that in July we agreed to a postponement of the Anglo-Irish Conference. The view was held by many parties at that time that the talks were likely to proceed during August.  This meant in effect that five weeks had been lost and the purpose of the extension between now and November is to replace the time that was lost.  It was also important that I show goodwill and good faith towards the talks, and that we give a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>To come back to the question raised by Deputy Barry, it is equally important that the Anglo-Irish Conference is seen not to be set aside or in any way diminished. There were developments in the North of Ireland in relation to violence &mdash; there was an escalation of violence especially from the Loyalist side &mdash; and an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting was necessary to address the change in pace of violence up there, which we all deplore. Consequently, in my discussions with John Major, the British Prime Minister, we discussed the matters that needed to be taken care of.  We agreed that 16 November was a suitable date for the meeting and that date is not changeable.  On that day we will see what progress has been made in the talks and will evaluate the position.  The Anglo-Irish Conference will take place on 16 November.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he regards as Irish the million or so inhabitants of Northern Ireland who describe themselves as Unionists &mdash; the vast majority of these people define themselves as Irish &mdash; and, if so, does he not believe that by relieving their anxieties in offering to change Articles 2 and 3 it would eliminate a major obstacle to progress towards a solution in Northern Ireland?  No-one believes that the removal of Articles 2 and 3 alone will bring about a solution but they are a <Col N="80" /> major obstacle.  Finally, would the Taoiseach not agree that the alteration of Articles 2 and 3 from a territorial claim to an aspiration would end the distorted view in the South of Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I regard the one million Unionist people as Irish. They live on the island and they have to be accommodated on this island, but I do not believe the removal of one anxiety to try to pacify another is the real way forward.  I am quite certain, and I am sure many Deputies in this House would agree, that we have to be extremely careful in the balanced approach we make to both sides of the political divide and to the two identities up there.  We want to ensure that we do not open a door to further violence either on the Nationalist or the Unionist side.  Constitutional politics has taken over and we want to ensure it holds its place at the centre of the stage. That is what I am there to do and I am working for nothing else but peace on this island of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the exchanges that have taken place could the Taoiseach confirm that in the event of a satisfactory outcome of the total talks Articles 2 and 3 might perhaps be altered or, to use the Taoiseach's charming Republican phrase, could be up for sale? Is that a correct interpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hypothetical question from the Deputy.  Articles in the papers by his leader reflect what I believe is a very sensible pragmatic approach to the question of Articles 2 and 3.  In those articles he cautioned that we should not rush into any immediate changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>I am seeking in these talks a final agreement on the totality of relationships.  I do not believe that interim peace, with the prospect of violence breaking out again in a short time, is the real answer to our problems.  We have an opportunity now to try to settle the historical differences on this island and that is the objective I have set for myself.  I am surprised at Deputy Mac Giolla's statement that this is the first time he has heard the word &ldquo;peace&rdquo; mentioned in relation to these talks.  It was the first word I mentioned when I took over as Taoiseach.  I decided I would set out to find a new path to peace and I am staying on that road.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Supreme Court, on 21 August last, decided that: (a) the respondent, who is the sole member of the inquiry into the beef processing industry, is not legally entitled to inquire into or consider the discussions, if any, occurring during the course of a meeting of the Government; and (b) the respondent is not legally entitled to inquire into or go beyond the terms of a formal or informal decision so expressed of a meeting of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was taken independently by the Attorney General in fulfilment of his <Col N="84" /> constitutional duty, as the court recognised, and was argued by him on legal and constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>Under the Supreme Court's judgment, no member of the Government or other person attending a meeting of the Government may divulge information about Government discussions.  Information on decisions is communicated to those concerned, in accordance with well established practices, which so far as I am concerned, fully comply with the terms of the judgment.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the Chief Justice, in his judgment, said that the implication of confidentiality from the provisions of the Constitution was justified by the practical impossibility of carrying on the fundamental functions of Government in its absence.  Mr. Justice Hederman, in his judgment, said that if it were permissible to compel in any circumstances the disclosure of the content of discussions which take place at Government meetings, the Executive role of the Government as envisaged in the Constitution would be undermined, perhaps even destabilised.  Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, in giving judgment, said that Dáil Éireann cannot possibly be concerned with the process of dialogue by which the Government evolve policies or reach their decisions.  That would, he says, involve the Legislature invading the sphere of the Executive which is not permissible under the doctrine of the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>I fully accept and endorse these views. I do not, therefore, intend any legislative or constitutional action along the lines suggested in the questions tabled by Deputies De Rossa and Spring.  At the same time, I can confirm to the House that the Government will continue to co-operate with the beef tribunal in every way open to them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am satisfied that adequate precautions are in place regarding the confidentiality of Government proceedings, in accordance with the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that on 20 July 1992 the Attorney General <Col N="85" /> made a submission in writing to the Supreme Court to the effect that absolute confidentiality attaches to Government discussions, why, three days later, did the Taoiseach categorically say in a briefing to the media that the Iraqi position had been discussed at a meeting of the Cabinet on 8 June 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not be listening carefully to what I am saying. The case in the Supreme Court was taken by the Attorney General in fulfilment of his constitutional duty, as the court recognised, and was argued by him on legal and constitutional grounds.  Of course the position has changed since 23 July last and I am now constrained by the terms of the Supreme Court decision to which I have referred.  While I would like to be more helpful in relation to this aspect of the question tabled by Deputy Bruton, I am sure he appreciates, as does everyone else, that I cannot be more helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he was aware that the Attorney General claimed that absolute confidentiality attached to meetings at the time the Taoiseach breached that principle on 23 July of this year by purporting to disclose what had happened at a Cabinet meeting on 8 June 1988?  Was the Taoiseach aware that the Attorney General, only three days earlier, claimed absolute confidentiality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Taoiseach does not feel that legal or constitutional change is necessary in the area of Cabinet discussions.  In relation to the assurances of the Taoiseach regarding the Government's co-operation with the beef tribunal, may I have an undertaking from the Taoiseach that he is still fully prepared to co-operate with the beef tribunal? <Col N="86" /> Will he assure the House that his legal team are not trying to delay or postpone his appearance at the beef tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  The Deputy and everybody else can rest assured that I will be available at the earliest possible opportunity to appear before the beef tribunal, when I am requested to do so.  I hope the request will not coincide with my appearance at a Summit but, even if it does, there will only be a delay of a matter of days.  I will co-operate fully with the beef tribunal in their deliberations; I will be as helpful as I can having taken into consideration the obligation placed on me &mdash; and everybody else &mdash; in relation to Cabinet confidentiality.</P>

      <P>It is a regrettable aspect of our society and administration, Government and local, that there is a virtual obsession with secrecy.  The judgment of the Supreme Court seems to copperfasten this secrecy.  The Taoiseach indicated that he supports the Supreme Court judgment and agrees with it. However, he also said that he would like to be more helpful in regard to the questions raised by Deputy Bruton.  Will he agree that there is a contradiction in what he said as he claims he is obliged not to be helpful to Deputy John Bruton while claiming at the same time to support the Supreme Court judgment?  Does he not wish to see that this judgment restricts the manner in which people &mdash; in particular the Dáil &mdash; can inquire into matters and be informed in relation to the activities of Government?  Will he accept that it should be changed?  While confidentiality is important it should not be absolute and if it requires&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Rome provides that the members of the Commission shall be appointed by common accord of the Governments of the member states.  The term of office of the present members of the Commission expires on 6 January next.  When the intergovernmental conference to reach &ldquo;the common accord&rdquo; has taken place, there will, no doubt, be an announcement of the appointments.</P>
      <P>In nominating a Commissioner the Government will, of course, have regard to the requirements of the Treaty that Commissioners shall be chosen on the grounds of their general competence and be persons whose independence is beyond doubt.</P>
      <P>In addition, as I said in reply to a previous question on 10 March last, the Government will take fully into account the best interests of this country and of the European Community, including the fundamental importance we attach to the Commission's pivotal role under the treaties &mdash; a role we wish to see fully maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to avail of this occasion to pay a tribute to Commissioner Ray MacSharry.  While performing his duties fully in accordance with the Treaty provisions that Commissioners shall neither seek nor take instructions from any Government or from any other body, he has ensured that in all the work of the Commission, there was a full understanding <Col N="91" /> of Ireland's particular needs and circumstances.  More generally, he has, through his outstandingly effective discharge of his important portfolio, reflected great credit on Ireland and helped to underline our commitment, as a country, to the Community and to European integration.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that he will continue to distinguish himself in the course of the work still to be done during his remaining term of office.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I asked Commissioner MacSharry to accept nomination as Commissioner for a further term of office but that he informed me of his decision to leave public life and to tackle new challenges in the private sector.  I regret, but understand and respect, that decision and I am sure the entire House will join me in expressing thanks and appreciation for all he has contributed to public life, to Ireland and to the European Community and in wishing him every success in his new endeavours in the private sector.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of the Deputy and for the information of the House, I point out that until last Monday afternoon it was not clear, nor had it been agreed, what the terms and the basis of the appointment of the next Commissioner would be.  Under Article 158 of the Treaty the position on 1 January 1993 if the Maastricht Treaty were not ratified, would be that the appointment would be for a period of four years, with an insertion in the contract that it would be terminated after two years to allow for the new parallellism that is being sought to have the Parliament and the Commission function for the same period, and that consequent to the introduction of such parallellism the period of appointment would be for five years from 1 January 1995.  It was only on last Monday evening that that issue was finally clarified.  The Deputy will appreciate that that was a very important factor that had to be cleared up before any names could be considered.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach in wishing Mr. Ray MacSharry well in his new course in private life.  The reforms he undertook in the Common Agricultural Policy were urgent and essential and were well carried through. Perhaps those reforms were one factor that led to Mr. MacSharry's decision to go into private life.  Would the Taoiseach <Col N="93" /> indicate what criteria he intends to use in choosing the person he will nominate to the Government and whether or not the selection criteria will be confined solely to members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 17 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government earlier this year approved the introduction of four pilot schemes in each of the 12 partnership areas introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These <Col N="95" /> schemes offer financial assistance and benefits to persons who have been unemployed for 12 months and who start their own businesses, enter paid employment, education or training courses, or partake in a community employment development programme.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the schemes is to remove, in a very direct way what is seen to be a strong disincentive, namely benefits attaching to the welfare system which are removed when a person gets a job.  The arrangement to be piloted in the area-partnerships will show the extent to which this is a real barrier, for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Persons who start their own businesses will be paid an allowance equivalent to their unemployment assistance or benefit for a period of 12 months.  They will also retain the secondary benefits applicable to such assistance or benefit from the Departments of Health, Social Welfare or local authorities.</P>
    <P>The schemes relating to paid and self employed are in operation since 1 July. The community employment development programme is in operation from 1 October and the scheme for training and education will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the uptake of the schemes may be: 500 persons in paid employment; 300 persons in self employment; 1,000 persons in education/ training; 3,000 persons in CEDP.</P>
    <P>The schemes are being administered by the relevant Government Departments and local authorities in liaison with Area Partnership Companies.</P>
    <P>The numbers who have availed of the schemes to date are small given the recent start up dates.  Reports of the uptake will be provided by the Area Partnership Companies on a quarterly basis and I will have these laid before this House for information.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is important to recognise that a more coherent and equitable linking of our welfare and tax systems will be necessary to allow the approach of the schemes I have outlined to be replicated country-wide at an acceptable cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> At the practical level, I have asked the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; acting in close consultation with other relevant public bodies &mdash; to bring forward for consideration by Government specific recommended policy measures for the equitable linking of the tax and welfare systems.  The Central Review Committee will be reporting to me, and through me to Government, on my request to them in this area as part of the review of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> at the end of this month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the view of my party that this proposal to allow and encourage those who are unemployed to set up in business is most welcome. Would the Taoiseach agree that any such exemptions from the social welfare legislation as introduced should be done on the basis of statutory provision approved in this House and that there is a danger that if an administrative decision is made to exempt people in some areas from social welfare rules that are applied rigidly in other areas there could be a legal claim of discrimination on the basis that it has not been approved in the House? I ask the Taoiseach when legislation will be introduced to give the necessary statutory authority for this welcome improvement in social welfare provisions in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy, on behalf of his party, supports this move.  The proposal is a pilot scheme operated in the 12 partnership areas.  It does carry with it some risk, but I consider that the almost 300,000 unemployed out there would expect this House to take whatever initiatives are possible.  This area has been held up as an example in which disincentives to return to the labour force have been identified.  This scheme is being operated on a trial basis. If it is a workable proposition country-wide and can be effected at an acceptable cost, we will come back to the House on it.  There is an element of risk involved, and I would be the first to recognise that. <Col N="97" /> The people want us to take initiatives and to take risks; we cannot be waiting for a statutory basis for everything.  I have been informed by the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance that this issue can be controlled.  They are in a position to monitor it and report fully on it when the experiment is carried through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Priority Question No. 45 and Oral Question No. 52 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government have considered the recommendations of the Culliton report and the Moriarty Task Force on a number of issues including the matter of agency restructuring.  They decided on a structure which met the essence and objectives of the recommendations while ensuring that appropriate linkages and coherence was maintained between the arrangements to promote the development of indigenous industry and those to promote inward investment.</P>
      <P>This structure will involve the establishment of a new agency for industrial development with separate and independent divisions for (i) the promotion, support and development of indigenous industry and (ii) the attraction of investment from overseas.  There will be separate boards with executive and non-executive members for the indigenous development and overseas divisions, and separate grant-in-aid allocations will be made to each board to achieve transparency as to costs and targets.</P>
      <P>I envisage seeking Government approval for the scheme of legislation to give effect to this decision this month and introducing the Bill in the current session.  The establishment of the new agency will then proceed quickly after enactment of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The question of additional funds or resources does not arise at this stage.  I would expect at the very least that the new more focused approach and integrated delivery of services should result in greater effectiveness and efficiency, and in a cost effective manner.</P>

My problem with the Minister's suggestion is that if the organisation is already in place &mdash; the Minister will appreciate how the Civil Service works &mdash; it would be very hard to make changes at that stage.  Whatever chance you have of making changes when legislation <Col N="100" /> is going through, if something is in place it is very difficult to change it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 46, 47, and 48, Oral Questions Nos. 55, 57 and 81 and Written Question No. 103 together.</P>
      <P>The recent dramatic fall in the value of sterling, coupled with the ongoing turbulence in the currency markets, has created serious difficulties for a number of Irish firms.  On Thursday, 24 September 1992, I asked my Department to undertake, as a matter of urgency, a detailed analysis of the problem.  Subsequently, on 29 September 1992, the Government decided to establish a working group, under the chairmanship of my Department, and representative also of the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food and the Marine, and semi-State bodies as appropriate, to look at the nature and content of the problems arising for firms as a result of the decline in the value of sterling and to make recommendations as soon as possible.  The working group's report was considered by the Government yesterday.</P>
      <P>The working group concluded that many manufacturing firms face serious difficulties in maintaining positive margins on sales in the UK market and in those parts of the domestic market and certain major overseas markets which are subject to strong price competition from UK firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These problems are not confined to <Col N="102" /> specific sectors; firms in all sectors of industry have suffered immediate erosion of margins arising from the devaluation of sterling.  However, the sectors which are most badly affected are clothing, food products, small engineering firms, furniture and joinery, building products, saw-mills and firms which sell intermediate products.</P>
    <P>In general the working group concluded that the firms under greatest pressure have some or all of the following main characteristics: a high level of exports to UK, a high level of exposure to competition from UK competitors, low levels of input purchases, e.g. raw materials, from the UK, low margins, high gearing, high level of debtor exposure and little or no forward currency cover.</P>
    <P>The Government have carefully considered the report of the working group. They have decided to immediately establish a market development fund of £50 million for the period up to the end of March 1993 to assist firms which have been seriously affected by the recent turmoil in exchange rates.  By helping firms to help themselves, the fund will also contribute to the achievement of the stability necessary to maintain Ireland's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism at a time of considerable uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The fund will be administered by a special management team drawn from the relevant State bodies.  The establishment and management of the fund will be supervised and directed by a management board which will comprise the managing directors/chief executives of ABT, FAS and IDA together with representatives from the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour and the Marine, and a representative from the industry/employer bodies and ICTU.</P>
    <P>In establishing the fund, the Government emphasised that assistance would be directed very specifically at firms which would have temporary difficulty in maintaining employment and in adjusting to the recent fundamental changes in the market place arising from the devaluation <Col N="103" /> of sterling.  Firms will need to demonstrate the ability, commitment and actions being taken to manage their way out of current difficulties.  Operational criteria for support under the fund will be worked out in the next few days.  These will concentrate on providing help for firms whose profitability and employment is threatened because of the devaluation of sterling.  It is not intended as a permanent subsidy; it will be available only to enable firms to make the changes necessary following the sudden currency changes of recent weeks.  There will be a formal review of the operation of the fund at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The management team is meeting today to finalise all the practical details for support from the fund.  I would advise firms to contact An Bord Tráchtála or the IDA through their central and regional offices.  An Bord Tráchtála has installed a special help line &mdash; number: 1-800-424242.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will have to ring the helpline to get some details of what is actually involved &mdash; the Minister did not give them.  The Minister will appreciate that all I have to go on are the reports in this morning's newspapers, from which, of course, I am not allowed to quote at Question Time.  Therefore, he will have to correct me if I make wrong assumptions.  I understand from reports that only firms which are more than 50 per cent dependent on the United Kingdom market will get benefit and that the benefit will be a certain amount of money per employee.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct that the benefit will be a sum of £50 per week per employee for firms which qualify.  They will have to show a relatively heavy net dependence on the UK market or on the domestic market in sectors where they are in direct competition with UK companies or in a third market where they are similarly in competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all of that is correct. I hope the fund will prove adequate.  The <Col N="104" /> Minister said that the firms will have to show a heavy dependence on the United Kingdom market.  I thought it would have been more just that no matter what their dependence, that that could be isolated and they could be helped; even if it was only 10 per cent, that they could be helped in relation to that 10 per cent. This morning's papers have reported that firms must have a 50 per cent dependence before they get anything.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the UK market alone without any of the other factors I mentioned, that is so.  A firm who are only dependent as to 10 per cent of their sales on the UK market would not be put in jeopardy by recent events.  Obviously they would not be helped &mdash; they would prefer that this had not happened &mdash; but they would not be very seriously affected as, unfortunately, are many firms in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, I hope to be very succinct and brief.  The Labour Party welcome the prompt response of the Government in this regard but are concerned that even at this early stage they are being unnecessarily bureaucratic. I support Deputy Barry's comments. Would the Minister not agree that until stability is reintroduced into the currency markets the object of the exercise is to preserve in the short term existing jobs whether they relate to a 10 per cent share of the UK market or a 70 per cent share of the UK market?  Accordingly, may I ask the Minister if in the review at the end of the year to which he referred due regard will be had to that and the necessary changes made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to assure the Deputy that I have already given instructions to the management <Col N="105" /> board that they are to seek to be as flexible and non-bureaucratic as possible in regard to this matter.  It is an unfortunate fact of life that certain criteria have to be laid down; otherwise every firm in the country would apply.  Of course, a great many firms have been helped by recent developments; they are better off as a result of some of the recent currency changes.  It would be absolutely foolish to help firms which are actually better off for firms which are not materially affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is suggesting that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to have some criteria.  If there are criteria, sometimes the establishment of criteria is described as bureaucracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort will be made to avoid that and to try to be flexible. I want to assure the Deputy that not alone will there be a full review at the end of the year but that constant monitoring will be carried out by the people I have named in my reply; they will be watching this every week.  I envisage the management board meeting weekly to monitor it and if it is necessary to make a change in the criteria they will so recommend to me and I am quite sure, if I think it is reasonable, I will agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that the margins are extremely tight in the areas he listed and if one of those firms is 35 per cent dependent on the United Kingdom market it could put that firm into a loss-making situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The flexibility to which the Minister referred should extend from nought to 100 per cent and should not waver around 50 per cent.  That is the kind of flexibility I hope to see.  May I ask the Minister if he could arrange to have the rules governing the allocation <Col N="106" /> of these funds sent to Deputy Quinn. Deputy Rabbitte and me as we are depending on hearsay and newspaper reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have brought out guidelines but the final rules will not be established for some days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the point that firms which are only 20 per cent or 30 per cent dependent on the UK market should not be ruled out during these early days as that dependence and the effects of the realignment of currencies could tip them into loss-making situations.  It is important that those firms should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Each application will be examined on its merits by people who are well fit to carry out the examination. They have instructions to act in a flexible and reasonable fashion given the particular circumstances of each sector and each firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the report in this morning's newspapers was not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister &mdash; he may wish to come back to this another day when he can reply to it in more detail &mdash; if the Government, his Department or he anticipate providing any additional response to that already announced if the situation is more prolonged than we anticipate or if the divergence between the two currencies becomes wider and more permanent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been announced is intended to remain in force until the end of March next, if that <Col N="107" /> is necessary.  It is quite possible there may be dramatic changes in the whole currency situation and if there are we will bring it to an end straightaway if companies are not at a disadvantage as a result of it.  It is also possible that it could go the other way.  If it goes the other way I will certainly be asking the management board of this fund to look at the situation which arises then and give me advice based on the facts as they appear.</P>

    <Title>Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991  [  Seanad ]:  Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I had been referring to special voters and welcoming the changes in the registration process for them.  It was most unsatisfactory <Col N="368" /> that disabled voters were required to be certified annually to be sound of mind.  In fact, many people who were on the special voters register had not realised they were required to produce a medical certificate annually and as a result missed exercising their franchise in recent elections.  They assumed it was sufficient to register once. I am pleased that the Minister proposes this important change in the case of special voters.  Indeed the removal of those former provisions will take us to the stage at which special voters will be recognised as normal participants in our electoral process.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the nomination process.  The objective of legislation in this area should be to ensure that all who wish to make a serious attempt to be elected public representatives are given that opportunity.  Our electoral tradition has been to ensure that candidates are genuine in their intentions by the imposition of a deposit which is forfeited in the case of a candidate not receiving a level of support deemed to be indicative of their being serious candidates.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Bill before us it is proposed to increase the requisite deposit to £500 in order to restore the deterrent to frivolous candidates.  We should closely examine this aspect in the future ascertaining how effective it will prove to be in practice.  Probably only time will tell but I have examined some figures in respect of previous elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examination of such evidence demonstrates that, thankfully, we have not experienced enormous problems in general elections with too many candidates or with their numbers tending to confuse the electorate.  Even though the relative value of the requisite deposit has been reduced to 3 per cent of its original level, there has been remarkable consistency in the number of candidates standing in general elections.  For example, in 1932 there were 1.8 candidates for every seat available whereas, at the last election, that figure was 2.2 candidates per seat; in the two elections held in 1982, the figure was also 2.2 candidates per seat. It must be remembered that there are <Col N="369" /> smaller constituencies which would affect the balance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the number of candidates per seat.</P>
    <P>When one endeavours to ascertain what takes place in other European countries one finds that in most there is no deposit at all required.  Instead there is a requirement for nomination to be signed by between 20 and 2,000 constituents. For example, in France, Greece and Holland deposits are required but are quite small.  The deposit required to be paid in the United Kingdom probably is that which most closely resembles ours, not surprising since we inherited our system from a British statute.  Five years ago the British took the same move proposed in this Bill, that of increasing the deposit and lowering the forfeiture threshold.  In 1987 the British increased their electoral deposit from £150 to £1,000, reducing the forfeiture threshold from 12.5 per cent to 5 per cent of the total poll.  However, a recent study demonstrates that the number of candidates standing in by-elections increased since they raised their deposit to £1,000.  Provisional figures for their most recent general election showed a slight decrease only.  That leads me to wonder whether, if we experienced a problem in this area, this would be the best method of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>At some stage in the future we should break away from the British notion of requiring candidates to pay a deposit, instead linking such to the tangible rights of a candidate whenever he or she stands for election.  When a candidate is officially declared to be standing in an election he or she has three rights.  The first is that they receive a free copy of the electoral register of the constituency in which they are standing for election.  In some constituencies that cost can amount to £70.  They also receive the right to free postage worth approximately £20,000. Their third right is the one the Minister is proposing to abolish under the provisions of this Bill because it has not been exercised, that is, the right to a room in a primary school.  Clearly it will be seen that the first two cost the State and they would be of concern if there were too many candidates.  In regard to the free <Col N="370" /> postage which could amount to £20,00 per candidate, perhaps in the future we should consider a deposit of, say, £100 in the case of candidates who do not ava of that facility and a deposit of £500 for those who do.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned that we might pitch the deposit too high.  If we take the example of the major parties represented in this House and examine what happened at the last general election we discover that 47 candidates standing for the major parties lost their deposits.  I might add that, in the last election, a candidate had to receive an average of 2,000 vote in order to secure his or her deposit. In the last election also one outgoing Deputy lost his deposit.  In the 1989 election two outgoing Deputies lost their deposits.  All these matters will have to be taken into consideration when we propose raising the level of the requisite deposit.</P>
    <P>Another relevant case is that of Deputy Roger Garland who, in 1987, lost his deposit and in 1989 was elected to this House.  We should be aware of such examples.  In that respect it would not be fair to say that Deputy Garland was less serious in his intent to be elected in 1987 than he was when elected in 1989.  He could not have been described as a firvolous candidate in the 1987 election. While welcoming the Minister's proposal in this Bill to reduce the number of vote required to secure a candidate's deposit I question whether that number should not be further reduced, perhaps to 10 per cent of the quota.  As we raise the level of the deposit in monetary terms simultaneously it will be important to ensure that genuine candidates are not placed in the position of losing their deposits.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the provisions of the section dealing with canvassing outside polling stations, a proposal which I predict will be enormously welcomed by the public at large who will be familiar with such practices.  I believe that canvassing outside polling stations does not contribute to the electoral process and most people would have that view.  It intimidates voters who would <Col N="371" /> rather be left in peace to exercise their franchise.  This provision will be welcomed also by those people throughout Ireland in all parties who had the onerous task of standing outside the polling stations and campaigning on behalf of candidates and their political parties.  In the past if one party manned the polling station other parties had to do likewise and the value of this had to be questioned. That provision of the Bill will be warmly welcomed by everyone.</P>
    <P>There may, however, be a problem with the provision in the Bill relating to posters displayed outside polling stations.  The Bill states that not only must new posters not be put up during polling, but posters on display before polling commences must be removed.  I welcome the fact that people will not be allowed to put up new posters on polling day because this work provided them with an opportunity to canvass. However, I question the requirement that posters on display before polling commences must be removed.  This would be more relevant to urban areas. There would be many hoardings and large advertisement boards within 50 metres of the polling stations displaying posters for many weeks before election day and I wonder if it is practicable to expect that these will be removed on the day before polling day.  I know this is not an issue in rural areas.  I represent many village areas in my constituency and there are no large advertising boards.  In the urban areas it is not practical to expect that this requirement will be fully implemented because there are many large hoardings within 50 metres of the polling stations.  The provision which prevents people from putting up posters within 50 metres of the polling stations on polling day is important and its inclusion in the Bill is very welcome. Canvassers, as distinct from political parties' posters, create problems for voters. Difficulties would arise in a small number of cases and this provision covers such difficulties.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make the point that one of the key contributions of the <Col N="372" /> Bill lies not in its innovation but in the bringing together into one Bill the bulk of electoral legislation.  This point was made earlier by speakers from other parties. It is important that this is recognised and that the Minister is complimented for it because consolidation measures like this do much to improve the accessibility of the law to non-experts.  People can look through this consolidated legislation and take note of the various provisions included in it.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Bill before us taking into account provision for the issues I raised.  In regard to 18 year olds whose birthdays fall on 2 December, it would be 16 months before they could join the supplementary register and this is a matter we will have to consider in the future.  The concept of the supplementary register is positive.  It will bring on board the people who failed to get on to the register due to technical errors and I welcome it.  We should try to include the 18 year olds and the second group I mentioned, the people who move house after 1 September; they should be able to go on to the supplementary register in their new constituency.  The changes in the Bill are very welcome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to welcome the provision in the Bill that people cannot congregate outside polling stations.  Many supporters of my party and other parties have done marvellous work over the years in giving their time and working outside the polling <Col N="373" /> stations on election day.  Long ago this was important when people were not as familiar with candidates as they are today.  Television, radio, local radio and newspapers have changed the concept of elections.  The day is now past when people have to be told who candidates are and if they do not know the candidates this is a reflection on the way elections have been conducted by candidates and their canvassers.  The electorate are now sophisticated enough to go out and vote and they know how they are going to vote in advance of reaching the polling stations.  The election day is a long working day for canvassers.  Many of them campaign for three weeks before the election.  They deserve a day of rest, but because one party canvass all parties canvass.  If people were to see only one party canvassing outside a polling station they might think their own party were not active.  Now that it has been decided to clear everybody within 50 metres from the polling stations the pressure will be lifted from all parties and they will be pleased to avoid the onerous task of having canvassers outside polling stations.  There is nothing as miserable as a wet polling day, when colleagues and members of other parties get soaked to the skin standing outside polling stations for 12 hours.  This is not right, it should not be allowed to happen and I welcome this change in the Bill.  Section 147 of the Bill prohibits one to loiter or congregate in the vicinity of the polling station and is an offence.  If one is to loiter it suggests one is hanging around and to congregate suggests a group of people.  If the chairman and secretary of the local branch of a political party were walking up and down outside a polling station, carrying no posters, they are not covered under the next section which states that displaying cards or influencing people to vote, is forbidden and is an offence.  Are they in breach of section 147 (2) (c)?  I would like the Minister to define what to &ldquo;loiter&rdquo; means.  To take the normal meaning of &ldquo;loiter&rdquo;, suggests that a person who is walking up and down, 20 yards outside a polling station, talking to his companion, who may be a well known <Col N="374" /> personality in the area could be said to be influencing people who are going to vote, but he may not be commiting any offence.  Section 147 also states that people who assemble within 50 metres of the polling station, display posters or try to unduly influence people going to vote, are guilty of an offence.  In the Bill I could not find any definition of what offence this is, what would happen to a person who was guilty of such an offence who finds them guilty.  Does the other party have to report that there are shenanigans at the polling station and call the Garda? There appears to be a threat there and I am not sure how regulations covering this are going to be implemented.  Since all political parties and their supporters are extremely responsible they will not look for a thin edge of the wedge to get around this.  The provision regarding the use of loudspeakers at polling stations could cause problems.  Until now it has been very easy to recognise a polling station because people congregated outside. When the new rules are introduced it is possible that somebody driving along using a loudspeaker will arrive in the vicinity of a polling station without realising it.  People using a loudspeaker in Carlow town will know all the polling stations in the immediate area but they might go to Tullow or Muinebeag or through a rural area where they might find it difficult to identify polling stations because there would be no activity outside. An individual might not know where the polling station was.</P>
    <P>The use of loud speakers at examination time should be banned.  Elections are often held in June when examinations are in session and students have enough to cope with, without competing with loud speakers.  If an election coincides with the examination period, the Minister should bring in an order banning the use of loud speakers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in regard to the register.  People who find that they are not included on the official register have no say for the next ten months.  It is very important that there is to be a supplement but I have some points to make about it. It is not fair to ask people to check the <Col N="375" /> register when they have been voting for 50 or 60 years.  They should be able to presume that they will not be removed from the register if they have been living in the same house.  The onus is on those compiling the register to make sure of this.  It has happened that a person who was conscientious enough to check that his name was on the draft register found that his name was omitted in the final print of the register.  It is grossly unfair that anybody should be deprived of a vote in such a way.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my suggestion that the county registrar should be allowed to give that person a vote on the date of the election, provided sufficient proof is available as to identity and so on.  The parish priest or perhaps the Deputy could vouch for the fact that this person lived in a certain place.  Most people will not discover that they are not on the register until they go to the polling station.  In Carlow the late Bishop Lennon went to vote and discovered his name had been left off the register.  There should be some provision in the Bill to give a person the right to vote, on the authority of the county registrar.  If it can be done 12 days earlier it should be possible on the day of the election.  It might cause problems in cities where people are not known but in rural constituencies people are known personally, very often known to the county registrar.  Perhaps something can be done to amend the Bill in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that we do not cater for people who, because of the nature of their work, will be away from the country on election day.  Some people represent firms in England, going there on Monday and returning on Thursday.  They should be able to give advance notice, confirmed by their firm, which would allow them to be catered for.  Airline staff who travel abroad are in same position.  They pay their taxes here, yet they are deprived of their vote.  We do not cater for people like this, even when their rota is known in advance.</P>
    <P>It is indefensible that presiding officers who are safeguarding the processes of democracy can be deprived of a vote if <Col N="376" /> they happen to cross the border from one constituency to another.  There are so many constituencies in cities that this can happen very easily.  In my area somebody across the bridge from Graiguecullen, which is in the Laois-Offaly constituency, can find himself presiding in Carlow-Kilkenny. Such a person should not be deprived of a vote in his own constituency. It should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Department to devise a system which would guarantee that presiding officers would be enabled to vote. They should not be deprived of that right because they happen to be a quarter of a mile on the wrong side of a river, a railway or a road.  I would ask the Minister to see that they are catered for.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes for special voters.  Last year I attended a meeting at which people were irate that they had to be declared sound of mind.  They found it personally offensive and I am glad that requirement has been removed.  The idea of a medical certificate to be produced every time such people apply for a vote has also been dropped.  I compliment the Minister on these major steps.</P>
    <P>There is a problem regarding free postage during election campaigns.  Perhaps the political parties could devise a system whereby literature would go to households rather than individuals, thus avoiding wasteful duplication.  People take offence when four or five envelopes containing the same literature arrive in their letter box.  So much wastage gives bad example.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that photographs should be included on the ballot paper.  I know one couple who did not vote in the last election because their daugher was illiterate and they would not humiliate her in the polling booth.  They said I did nothing about it but I did raise the matter here.  I do not know how expensive it would be to include black and white photographs of the candidates, but we must remember that we are obliged to cater for everyone entitled to vote.  People who cannot read names can recognise photographs.  I would ask the Minister to cost this proposal.  We must cater for minorities.  Those who cannot <Col N="377" /> read do not deserve public humiliation or embarassment.  They are entitled to be able to recognise the candidates on a ballot paper and to mark it accordingly.</P>
    <P>The question of posters at the polling stations has been dealt with.  It is time to look seriously at the use of posters during election campaigns.  Fine Gael blazed a trail under Deputy Garret FitzGerald by introducing &ldquo;eight by four&rdquo; posters.  This has been copied by important political parties since, but perhaps the time has come to allow only such posters.  At a time when people are interested in tidy towns, posters hanging upside down, sideways or blowing in the wind, do more to discourage people from voting than to get them out.  Posters hanging on poles, sideways and upside down or half torn do not sell a message.  The &ldquo;eight by fours&rdquo; would introduce some kind of order and it would look as if there was some kind of organisation behind a poster campaign.  I would be quite happy to see my picture on an &ldquo;eight by four&rdquo; poster.</P>
    <P>The removal of posters is covered by legislation.  In fairness, political parties co-operate in taking down election posters as soon as the polls close.</P>
    <P>I got a kick from section 35.  It convinced me that there is still a sense of humour in the Department.  The section deals succinctly with the difficulties for a person who is elected in two constituencies. Many of us have difficulty in getting elected in one constituency and only someone with a great sense of humour would introduce section 35.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to my colleague I was thinking about those who have difficulty <Col N="378" /> in being elected in more than one constituency.  It is interesting that the Department thought of that as being sufficiently important to warrant inclusion of the Bill.  It is not something that has affected most Members or even the members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleague that a great deal of littering has been caused by irresponsible postering.  However, the political parties are not, by a long stretch of the imagination, the worst offenders. Political parties are meticulous in removing posters immediately after an election. Many other groups throughout the country do not bother.  The groups I refer to have an interest in politics but are not necessarily political parties.  A few posters from such groups can be seen throughout the city and they have been there for six months at this stage.  One should acknowledge that political parties do a reasonably good job in this regard. We should acknowledge also that postering is one of the trappings of democracy. Democracy has its weaknesses but we should not go overboard in removing all the trappings that go with democracy provided damage is not done to property and great offence is not caused to people. Every system has its shortcomings.  Centralised systems have their shortcomings and people living under those systems would love an opportunity to put up posters or to congregate around polling stations.  Perhaps we have gone a bit overboard with our system.  Crowds outside polling stations may be a source of intimidation to people going to vote but in rural areas some people get great enjoyment out of meeting neighbours at polling stations.  It is regarded as a festive occasion.  However, in some urban areas competition has become very intense and perhaps a certain amount of pressure has been put on people going to vote and this should not be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill refers to the register of electors. I am sure others will have noticed that since the compilation of the register was computerised, it has become a lot worse than when it was compiled in the old fashioned way.  I do not know why that is so.  There are numerous instances <Col N="379" /> of elderly people going to vote on polling day being told that they were no longer on the register.  On investigation we find that the local authority, for some reason best known to themselves, do a random selection and write to a number of people telling them that the register is being checked and asking if they are hale and hearty and still living at the address.  Elderly people might consider that this has been sent out by some school leaver who has just joined the local authority, that it is unimportant, and ignore it.  The next thing they know is that they have been removed from the electoral register.  In the last few elections that happened to a large number of people.  I hope we do not have a repetition of that.  Computerisation is welcome and it has achieved a great deal but we must ensure that we do not go backwards.  If we become so efficient that we, for example, take out all the people whose names begin with A, B or, worse D, it could cause serious problems.  I hope that problem has been resolved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision in regard to voters who had been obliged to give an indication of soundness of mind.  That question is an insult.  Regardless of what other people might think of them, every person has a democratic right to express his or her view in the ballot box.  As my colleague Deputy Browne said, the use of photographs might be a help in some cases, but a person should have the freedom to express his or her choice in the ballot box at any time.  A little progress can be reported in this area.</P>
    <P>Many facets of electioneering and politics generally associated with our political system down the years are now regarded as old-fashioned.  Even some of the systems operating in this House are old-fashioned. However, many of these systems have been inherited from our forefathers who spent a great deal of time and effort in trying to devise a system that would enable us to enjoy all these peculiarities and we should not throw them aside lightly.  Democracy needs to be given the expression it has been traditionally given.  If we decide not to have <Col N="380" /> posters because people do no like them, not to have public address systems because people do not like the noise, that we will not have electioneering as we did previously because some people get offended or that we will not send a multiplicity of election leaflets to people's houses because of the waste, eventually it will not be worth our while to have a campaign at all.  We could just put a notice in the paper telling people when an election is to be held and that they should go along to vote on the day.  Some people might say that is the way it should be done but places where that has been done have tended to be places where there has not been a huge emphasis on democracy.</P>
    <P>Generally I would support the Bill.  It will certainly improve access to voting and the full pursuance of democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms I welcome the Bill which improves the existing situation. Much of the legislation dates back to pre-1900 and it is time we updated it.</P>
      <P>I understand this Bill deals basically with Dáil elections.  Nevertheless I thought this would have been a good opportunity to bring an amendment before the House in relation to the European elections.  Here I speak as one who had personal involvement in a particular situation I want to refer to.  I am pleased to note that the chief returning officer is present in the House because I am sure she also will remember the circumstances, having been directly involved at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having polled some 86,000 votes in the Leinster constituency at the last European election I lost the seat by ten votes after three or four recounts of a kind &mdash; and I do not want to be in any way critical of anybody in putting it that way. However, I was disappointed because there were 14,000 spoiled votes in Leinster in that election, probably the highest proportion of spoiled votes ever recorded.  The returning officer of the day made a decision which we subsequently disagreed with and which eventually found its way to the High Court.  It could be, of course, that the returning officer <Col N="381" /> in Leinster was right and that those everywhere else were wrong.  I would not, for one minute, make a judgment on that because even the High Court did not make a decision on it.</P>
    <P>In his summary of that case the judge, if not directly, indirectly indicated that it was a matter for the Legislature to deal with the subject which found its way to the High Court.  Everybody there and everyone in Leinster and elsewhere accepted that there was an anomoly in that the Act provided that interpretation of the way that ballot papers should be counted would be left to the returning officer.  The method of interpretation was not clearly defined.  This is a very serious matter because it means that each or any one of five returning officers can decide what is and what is not a spoiled vote.</P>
    <P>For the record, let us remember that two elections &mdash; the European election and the Dáil election &mdash; were held on the one day; people voted one, two, three, four, in the Dáil election and then went across to the European election ballot paper and voted five, six, seven and eight. In Dublin, Munster and Connaught-Ulster the returning officers decided that the ballot paper marked five, six, seven in sequence following the voting on the Dáil paper was equivalent to voting one, two, three, four.  However, in Leinster the returning officer decided otherwise. That is not a criticism of the returning officer because possibly she was right and the others were wrong.  However, the Act still does not clear that up and there were 14,000 spoiled votes in that instance.</P>
    <P>There was a recount, but the spoiled votes were not counted and were not taken into consideration.  In the recount which was carried out by the Honourable Judge of the High Court himself the 14,000 spoiled votes were not included. In other words, there was not a total recount but a recount of a portion of the ballot papers.  Subsequently, when the judge ordered that a further recount be taken and the chief returning officer who is one of our leading experts, if not the leading expert, in our system of elections did a very thorough job on that occasion. Nevertheless, there is a doubt in my mind <Col N="382" /> and in the minds of many as to the out come of that election, and I say that with no disrespect to any of my colleagues who are serving in the European Parliament Fourteen thousand spoiled votes is a lot of spoiled votes when one considers that in the end ten votes separated the last two candidates.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to use this opportunity to amend the regulations which I am sure he is entitled to do under this heading, to correct that anomaly.  I he does not do that, the same thing could occur at the next election.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record that this is not intended to be critical of anybody who participated in that election. However, this must be corrected and this will probably be the only opportunity to have it corrected unless the Minister brings in another amending Bill or amends the existing regulations.  Perhaps he might deal with this when he is replying.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters to which I want, briefly, to refer.  I agree absolutely with the elimination of political activity of any sort outside the polling booths on polling day in local elections, Dáil elections, European elections or any other kind of election.  I accept Deputy Durkan's point that there might be a bit of fun and games in a rural area but in some of the polling stations in urban areas and larger towns there might be 3,000 or 4,000 people voting in one polling station and this is where the difficulty arises.  There is no problem in a small rural area where there are a couple of hundred voters.  The difficulty arises in areas where there are several thousand voters, the majority of whom arrive during rush hour, at lunchtime or the last few hours.  At times the position outside some of these polling stations is frightening and there is no doubt in my mind that it leads to people deciding they will not go out to vote.  I have seen people turn back from polling stations, fights break out and abuse being hurled by the supporters of one party against the supporters of another.  While this may be part of the game, there should no longer <Col N="383" /> be warring factions outside polling stations.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that there should be no political activity within 50 metres of a polling station is a joke; whoever thought that one up must be a very funny person because the position is that most polling stations are located in schools and most school buildings are more than 50 metres from the road.  Does this mean that there should be no activity within 50 metres of the front door or wall of the school, from a person's front garden or the shopping centre on the right or left of the road, or should we draw a circle and say that people cannot go within 50 metres of the building even though there may be nothing behind it?  There is an avenue leading to most schools and all that will happen is that people will move their tables and literature from outside the school door or perimeter wall to the end of the street.  Therefore this will not make any difference because the same activity will take place at the end of the road.  I am speaking of constituencies I know well &mdash; such as Meath and Louth &mdash; and I say that this will not make any difference. In fact, it will probably lead to a worsening of the position.</P>
    <P>For a start, we will need an army of policemen to supervise this activity.  Who will ensure that there is no activity within 50 metres of these polling stations?  Will somebody have to stand there all day or will there be patrol cars outside polling stations?  There will be a riot if the police try to control this activity.  We would be far better off doing nothing than to implement this daft proposal.  I do not think the majority of the electorate and the activists of political parties would object if the Minister were to ban all activity &mdash; as they do in France &mdash; from 12 midnight the night before.  At that stage people have made up their minds.</P>
    <P>I agree there is no way one can influence people entering a polling station ten minutes before it is due to close as they already have made up their minds, unless, of course, they are told lies.  Candidates have lost an election when their party faithful told voters outside the polling <Col N="384" /> station that &ldquo;Joe has already been elected, do not vote for him but give Paddy your vote&rdquo;.  This has happened; it even happened to me.  I see the Minister of State laughing and I am sure he experienced this in Cork.  I have seen sitting candidates lose their seats because party activists told voters they had already been elected and did not need their votes and that they should give their vote to a colleague. That is another good reason to ban political activity outside polling stations.</P>
    <P>We must also address the question of how we can control the use of loudspeakers outside polling stations.  What should we do?  Are we to cocoon a school because sound can only be measured in decibels?  Are we to say that people cannot park a car carrying speakers outside the polling station but can do so down the road?  There is no way this can be done.  We will either have to ban their use or leave things as they stand.  I appeal to the Minister of State to introduce a couple of realistic amendments on Committee Stage to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>During his contribution Deputy McCartan referred to fishermen.  On the last occasion the entire fishing fleet at Clogher Head, which is in my constituency, was at sea all election day with the result that none of them was able to vote.  They went to sea at 6 a.m. and did not return until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. the following morning.  These people should be given a postal vote if they are registered fishermen and actively involved in the fishing industry.  It should be easy for them to prove this to officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  The same is true in the case of merchant seamen. Given that a member of the Navy who is a member of the Defence Forces has a postal vote, I do not see why merchant seamen should not also have one.  A ship will not dock in order to facilitate a seaman to exercise his constitutional right.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the register of electors.  We are subjected to much abuse and criticism about this matter.  No matter how often we check the register <Col N="385" /> some people will not be included.  While I think it balances itself out in that a few supporters of the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party as well as a few Independents will not be included, there is a need for greater scrutiny. The Minister of State's proposal that a supplementary list &mdash; it is described as a list of additions &mdash; should be printed would probably be better because the local authority would be in a position to tell those who had not been included, or whose names had been deleted, that their names have been included on this list.</P>
    <P>Like the Labour Party and all sections of the community, I do not see why a person who has been living in London for a few months or a year should not have the right to determine who the Government of the day should be given that the majority of these people will return to live in this country when they will be affected by decisions taken in this House.  They should have a democratic right to decide who the personnel of this House should be.</P>
    <P>The voting system continues to be abused but, in general, supervision at local polling stations takes care of this.  I should point out to the Minister of State who has stood in a greater number of elections than I, that if people are removed from polling stations we will lessen security given that the people who man polling stations know the majority of people who vote.  Both the Minister of State and I as well as each Member of this House know there have been abuses, with people using the polling cards of people who had gone on holidays or who had died.  If we ban activity within 50 metres &mdash; I appeal to the Minister of State to deal with that matter &mdash; there would be less supervision outside polling stations because there would be nobody there to see if people arrived to vote several times at different polling booths. As we are all aware, this has happened in the past.  An old colleague of mine frequently used the phrase: &ldquo;vote early and vote often&rdquo;, and to this day that still happens.  I would ask the Minister, if not in the legislation then in the regulations under the Bill, to make ID cards compulsory. <Col N="386" /> People must be advised in advance of going to the polling booth that they are obliged to carry ID cards, which should be carefully checked.  People in charge of polling booths should, unless they are absolutely certain of the identity of each person, insist that ID cards are produced.  The Minister should indicate in his reply what he proposed to do about the point I raised about an amendment to the Single European Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large I welcome the Bill as it corrects many of the anomalies that have existed for years. Like Deputy Bell, I welcome the 50 metre provision.  I assume that the aim is to provide a system of voting that is accessible in terms of geographical location to all voters.  It is very important that in our democracy the system is seen to be fair.</P>
      <P>A number of issues come to mind.  I have noticed over the years that many polling booths are inaccessible to the disabled. I am not speaking about the people on the special polling register but about people, for example, in wheelchairs who wish to cast their vote.  It is galling to see what happens at polling stations as these people try to gain access to cast their votes.  Something should be done in this regard because these are very special people who have a great contribution to make.  If they are able to work and pay their taxes they should be given every assistance in casting their votes.  We should have respect for them. I have witnessed extremely angry people who could not gain admission to polling booths to vote.  In some cases the presiding officer, whether or not he was within his rights, came to the door to allow these people to vote, and I see nothing wrong with that practice.  I hope this matter is dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now refer to an issue that many of my colleagues raised, that is illegal congregating, the wolf pack as I often call it.  Whether one is canvassing as a new candidate or otherwise there is no need for such a practice.  I agree with Deputy Bell in relation to the 50 metres provision, but I do not know how it will be <Col N="387" /> implemented.  Perhaps canvassing should be banned altogether.  Many polling stations are situated 50 metres from the main thoroughfare and there is nothing to stop people from standing on the other side of the road.  I do not know what regulations will be issued but I welcome the principle behind this provision. Nobody has referred to the fact that it is difficult to get people to canvass at present.  Our canvassers, the people we depend on, those who help us win a seat, will also welcome this provision.  Much thought should be given to its implementation. Unless canvassing is banned altogether it will be difficult to implement it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would refer to one point which has not been commented on today.  In a number of constituencies local national schools are out of bounds for political meetings.  The Department of Education have stipulated that schools cannot be used for political meetings. This issue does not arise every day of the week but I would like to know whether that is the case &mdash; perhaps I have taken the wrong interpretation from it.  In small villages, for example, the local school may be the only place where a group of people can meet and I see no reason bona fide political parties should not be allowed use it, assuming that all political parties have equal access.</P>
    <P>As regards the deposit, it is easier to get £500 today than it was to raise £100 50 years ago and I assume it is on that basis that this case is being made.  I hope we will never digress from the practice whereby any man or woman may contest an election and there should be no impediments to the contesting of an election. If a person wishes to put his name forward for election he should not be prevented from doing so due to lack of funds.</P>
    <P>The preservation of democracy is much more valuable than the provision of services such as health services and so on.  Unlike some European countries our system is such that the taxpayer is not directly involved in the funding of election campaigns.  Perhaps the Government <Col N="388" /> considered this matter but decided to ignore it.  My view, which is obviously shared by politicians on the Continent, is that in election campaigns political parties should give a signal as to what they intend to do in the following five years. There should be Exchequer funding, tightly controlled, with checks and balances, in order to curb the excesses we hear about in relation to funding of political parties.  Under the Danish system Exchequer funding is provided in proportion to the number of first preference votes a party receive.  Such a system would be welcome here, but those funds should be used specifically for election campaigning and not to pay staff in party headquarters or for any other purpose. There should be controls on the proliferation of election canvassing material and posters.  The practice of putting posters on telegraph poles has long outlived its usefulness.  People do not pay any attention to it as we now have more powerful media in the form of television, radio and newspapers.  It is important that democracy is kept alive and well but, at the same time, tighter controls would not cause an outcry.  I do not know whether the checks and balances would work but we could give it a try.</P>
    <P>How well are presiding officers and poll clerks briefed before they do their job, particularly for the first time?  Is there a system to brief them because I have been told that some presiding officers did not know how to solve a problem when it arose.  I hope the Minister will refer to this in his reply.</P>
    <P>Many people have mentioned photographs on ballot papers.  I do not see any reason for not having them, especially in the case of youthful Members.  Many voters would like to see a photograph of the candidates, this applies particularly to illiterate people who do not want anyone to know that they cannot read or write.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House but I wish to comment on this important legislation and to welcome it.  It is time we applied ourselves to this situation and made provision for all the changes which render what was deemed appropriate in the past irrelevant or unnecessary at present.  The situation which obtained where, traditionally, representatives of all parties congregated outside polling booths to operate &mdash; in some cases, not all &mdash; as an intimidatory measure in relation to people casting their votes should be changed.  However, I agree with Deputy Bell that it will not be changed by the provisions of this Bill. The distance of 50 metres still leaves people almost within the precincts of the school.  If it was 50 metres from the extreme point or points of the surrounding walls or palings there would be some justification for it but 50 metres from the polling station borders on the ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Another provision, which does not indicate that people have visualised the practicalities of what happens when people cast their votes, especially during the last hour when they are flowing in, is the obligation on the presiding officer to ensure that the stamp is on the ballot papers before they are inserted in the box.  The presiding officer would need eyes in the back of his head; he does not have the power of bilocation, he cannot distribute ballot papers and also ensure that the stamp is on them.  He is also supposed to keep an eye on the voters placing the ballot papers in the ballot box.  What is the reasoning behind this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that everything which comes before us has been subjected to a certain amount of examination, adjudication and thought.  However, I should like to know whether we are providing for a situation where bogus ballot papers might be inserted.  Are we providing for a situation where the presiding officer might, inadvertently, not stamp the ballot paper? What happens if he discovers that the <Col N="390" /> stamp is not on the ballot paper?  Does he issue a new one?  In replying, I should like the Minister to elaborate on the need for the introduction of such a provision when we all know that other considerations need attention.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in regard to the deposit as £500 represents much more to one person than another.  This could lead to frivolous candidates going forward. For example, a person might have made his fortune and now feels that he should indulge in this caper; £500 would mean nothing to him.  However, if you reduce it you automatically invite people to look at elections as a means for having a Lord Sutch in every constituency.  He goes forward with extraordinary regularity in elections in the United Kingdom.  I do not know what he hopes to achieve; it must be a form of mild entertainment for him because, obviously, he is not likely to succeed in being elected.</P>
    <P>Our views must be conditioned, to some degree, by what our constituents tell us.  Over the years I have regularly received complaints about the equity in the appointment of presiding officers although their quality is never questioned. A person holding an important position in a local authority or the headmaster of a school are often appointed presiding officers but they do not need the appropriate fee.  With unwelcome regularity he or she appears to preside at every election while, in the same constituency, there would be many people equally endowed with intelligence and knowledge of the Electoral Acts and much more in need of the fee.  Consideration should be given to this question. I know the first requirement is to have the best person possible for such an important position but I am sure there are many people available beyond the narrow range which has obtained to date. This would ensure fewer complaints from constituents.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to free post, posters and so on are not sufficient to provide for the dramatic change that has occurred in communications.  Deputy John Browne mentioned one very important point.  I do think that when <Col N="391" /> one offers some criticism or seeks an alternative one should have an alternative in mind.  I must confess that I do not have any such alternative in mind, and neither did Deputy Browne.  The idea that every person in a household of seven electors should be sent a copy of all of the publications issued does lead to criticism and gives the wrong impression that elections are unnecessarily expensive. I venture to suggest that before Committee Stage that position be considered with a view to reducing cost.</P>
    <P>In relation to the register of electors, the first obligation is on the local authority. I do not know what happens in the constituencies but it is clear that errors are made, for whatever reason.  It is hard to understand the reason behind the number of mistakes in the register because there are people appointed to visit each house in a locality, people who are obliged to check up on any changes that might have occurred since the previous register was taken.  During the most recent presidential election I found myself embarrassed by the number of mistakes in the register.  Politicians here will realise that invariably when mistakes occur at any level a degree of culpability is extended to us even though the mistakes may not be of our making.  During the previous presidential election I was chastised and very much criticised by five young nurses who lived in the one house. They had all voted in the previous general election and there had been no change in the occupancy of the House.  However, when those ladies went to vote they found that their names were not on the register. I accepted entirely the comments made to me by those young women.  One could have said that a draft register was available for inspection and, as literate ladies, they should have checked it.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that putting the obligation on electors should release us from the responsibility that exists in the first instance in respect of the compilation of the register.  There is absolutely no reason that anybody who has not changed residence between elections should not find his or her name included on the <Col N="392" /> register.  Culpability there lies with whomsoever was charged with the responsibility of checking the register. Perhaps the <i>modus operandi</i> now is such that one is paid according to the number of houses one visits &mdash; I do not know.  I would suggest that if that were so local authorities should be advised that irrespective of the number of houses visited the first and real obligation on the person so charged is to make sure that everybody in a house entitled to vote is recorded on the register.</P>
    <P>There is nothing else to which I wish to refer at the moment, especially when I am mindful that Deputy Pat Sheehan and Deputy McGrath are sitting in wait, anxious to enlighten me and the House as to their experiences and the ways in which the proposed legislation might be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I offer my thanks to Deputy Tunney for restricting his contribution. I agree entirely with many of the points raised by Deputy Tunney and I think that he put them forward in a much better fashion than I could have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point made by Deputy Tunney in relation to registers is the point with which I should like to begin.  I certainly welcome the provision of a supplementary register which can be compiled within a relatively short period of any election.  The provision of such a register will be a decided advantage and is a welcome measure.  I sincerely hope that the provision of the register can be worked out in a way that will not leave the register open to manipulation or abuse. How many times in elections, whether they be general or local elections, do voters who have lived in the same house and who have voted in election after election arrive at a polling station to cast their vote only to find that their name is not on the register?  Those people turn away dejected with us as politicians &mdash; and they will probably blame us for having let them down &mdash; and dejected with the system that allowed their name to be taken off the register.  As was rightly pointed out by Deputy Tunney, the local authorities should take the responsibility <Col N="393" /> to ensure that every elector is on the register and particularly those who have not moved house.  The publication of a short list of alterations at the appropriate period is a worthwhile change in the system and is one I welcome.  How often at Christmas time do we have to chase around with copies of a draft register under our arms, sending them out to various parts of each county for checking and alteration?  The thought of checking through a short list of alterations rather than a draft register is certainly attractive, particularly at the Christmas season.</P>
    <P>The major change in the Bill concerns canvassing outside polling stations.  I welcome the general thrust of the proposals made.  That is not to say that I would cast aspersions on the many people who have for decades stood outside polling stations on election day.  In fact, in rural areas one would often find that it is the same people who have stood outside the same polling station representing the same party election after election down through the years.  Perhaps it will be a bit of a shock to those people to find that they can no longer put forward their political views outside polling stations, but it is my opinion that many of them will be glad that the system is to be changed. The Minister indicated in his speech this morning that there would be a restriction on canvassing within 50 metres of the entrance to the grounds of a polling station.  That measure would probably get over the difficulty raised by Deputy Tunney.  I should like to know how that provision will be implemented.  I hope that it will work successfully.</P>
    <P>In my first election in 1989 I had experience of something that was raised earlier on.  That election was taking place during the time of the examinations for Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate.  In many instances polling stations are part of a school and often a secondary school and a primary school will be situated on the same campus, as with Christian Brothers and convent schools.  To have such a primary school used as a polling station when at the same time examinations are taking place in the secondary school has made life that little bit more <Col N="394" /> difficult for those sitting the examinations. Students will now be saved from having to run the gauntlet of canvassers during election time.  At the time of elections the use of loudspeakers should also be restricted.  I should like the Minister to have the power to say that when examinations are being sat in the locality of a polling station loudspeakers cannot be used.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section that will take away the anomaly that exists at presidential elections.  At the previous presidential election many presiding officers lost their vote.  It is estimated that perhaps 10,000 people were disfranchised as a result of that inclusion in the 1937 Act. I am glad that is now being rectified. I look forward to the next presidential election when all those people can cast their vote in a proper, democratic way. Perhaps provision can be made for local elections whereby if you are presiding in a different area from where you live you may actually cast a vote or if you happen to be residing in a different constituency from where you live you may also cast your vote.  I do not know how the Minister will go about that &mdash; I admit I am not setting him an easy task.  It would be important to include those people who officiate on the day.</P>
    <P>In relation to the deposit of £500 which is now required, I am opposed to that section.  I realise that with inflation the figure set in 1923 would be much larger now; nonetheless, I think £100 is appropriate and I do not see any real reason it should be increased.  After all many people may want to put their names forward as representing some particular persuasion or some particular group in their locality.  Instead of increasing the deposit, would it not be easier and make more democratic sense to provide that anybody putting themselves forward for election would require a number of electors to nominate them, be it 20, 50 or whatever?  Perhaps the Minister would examine that issue.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to something which is not mentioned specifically in the Bill, that is the location of polling booths. In rural areas many of the polling booths <Col N="395" /> are situated in small primary schools.  By and large they are adequate to house voting on election day.  In recent times I have noticed that some of the newer schools may not have outside lights so that at nighttime there can be great difficulty when people are trying to get in and out.  Schools do not normally have outside lights because they are not normally used in times of darkness.  It is important that people choosing voting areas be asked to ensure that the location has outside lighting for periods of darkness. There is a move afoot in recent years to lessen the number of polling booths, especially in rural Ireland.  That is a step in the wrong direction.  Of course we can all say: &ldquo;people can have transport, it is easy for people to get to polling booths, there is no difficulty.&rdquo; It is easy for the majority of people to get to polling booths.  Either they will get a lift or the political parties will send a car for them or whatever.  It is also important to note that people have their dignity and they may like to get to polling booths on their own.  They have been going to a particular polling booth for the last number of years and casting their vote there.  Why should they have to beg a lift from a neighbour or go three, four or five miles down the road?  One of our boasts as a country is that we are a democracy. Surely the removal of the polling booth from a locality to a location a number of miles away is taking away that sense of democracy.  The Minister should ask the local authorities and the registrars to ensure that the number of polling booths in existence at present is not lessened and, perhaps, in some areas they may be slightly changed.</P>
    <P>A strange situation arose in two polling booths in my own locality.  In 1983 there was a change in the location of polling booths.  One small townland comprising 49 voters was changed from voting in a particular polling station, in which they had voted for decades, to voting in a different polling station.  Those 49 voters have now to drive past the polling booth in which they used to cast their vote a further six miles to cast their vote in <Col N="396" /> another polling booth, all because of the way in which the district electoral divisions were established over a century ago.  I am not sure how that can be rectified but perhaps the Minister can inform me later.  Can those people be removed to vote in a polling booth outside their district electoral division.  It makes more sense if people vote in the area or village with which they are associated and where they buy their groceries and so on.  When replying perhaps the Minister would refer to that point.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the matter of post and literature which is distributed at election time.  So far as I understand the legislation, if you want to send out literature at election time you must name a voter on the register to whom you wish to send your literature. That created a problem during the presidential election in my own area.  During the presidential campaign we decided, instead of flooding each household with a number of items of literature for each voter, that we would send our literature to the family &mdash; the Bloggs family or whatever it was in each case.  However, we found that the post office would not accept that literature on the basis that it was not properly constituted as going to a particular voter on the register.  It would make sense to amend that regulation whereby election literature could be sent in that fashion to the family or perhaps there is some way in which it could be changed altogether and instead of having to put the names on the literature that the post office would deliver to each household.  That would save the embarrassment of putting a name on it when the man had died or had moved away.  It would also help in terms of efficiency by cutting down on waste and in getting this literature into houses in a much more streamlined fashion.</P>
    <P>The question of photographs on ballot papers has been reasonably well covered. It may be a help to illiterate voters.  I admire to a great extent any illiterate voter who goes down to the polling booth, walks up to a table and says to the presiding officer: &ldquo;I wish to vote, illiterate&rdquo;.  The whole place has to be <Col N="397" /> cleared while that person votes.  If I were in the same situation I do not think I would cast my vote.  The addition of photographs on the ballot papers would alleviate that situation and would encourage more such people to come out and vote.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to raise relates to posters and postering.  Many good points have been made in this regard and perhaps a great deal of money is wasted.  In general the political parties have been excellent down through the years in removing their posters and literature which they put up during election time. Rarely are posters left up for any substantial period after election time. However, in my own locality I am very disappointed to find that following the Maastricht referendum many road signs have been totally disfigured by literature from a particular sector who were calling for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote.  They pasted their posters on the backs of road signs.  It is a shame that it was done in that fashion.  I am aware the local authority have power to have them removed and that power should be invoked.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could send a notice to the local authorities, where that problem is prevalent, asking them to move on it and to get something done.  If we allow this to happen on one occasion then it will happen again.  The political parties have a good record in this regard. We should not allow somebody else to take away that good record.  Neither should we be brought into disrepute as a result of a lack of consideration, as I would call it, by some other group.  I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill and I look forward to amendments which may be introduced later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister of State. Deputy Dan Wallace, for introducing this Bill.  He and I started our political lives in the same ward and constituency.  While he may have had more success than I, nevertheless there is a similarity in our work in politics.  I congratulate him on bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this as a tidying up measure. <Col N="398" /> For that reason, it is welcome; some areas of our electoral system need tidying up. Our electoral system has been broad and scrappy and it is worth discussing the Bill from that point of view.  I ask the Minister to take on board the suggestion made this morning by my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, that the House should go into Committee to debate the points made by speakers during the past few hours. Members have put forward very worthwhile suggestions which need to be teased out on Committee Stage, one of the most successful ways of getting to grips with the problems before us.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one or two important points.  The first relates to the funding of political parties.  If there has been any abuse of the electoral system it was in relation to the funding aspect. Having contested a number of elections and studied how the system operates, I have to say that our electoral system is definitely not geared towards smaller parties or parties which do not have major funding.  I wish to again refer to the vital information brought to light by the beef tribunal, that the major political parties have been given huge sums of money by various people.  From this point of view alone, it was worth setting up the beef tribunal; it has shown where this funding went.  This was certainly an eye opener for the Labour Party and other smaller parties.  We always had our suspicions but the facts are now there for everyone to see.  Funding has been channelled to political parties with the excuse that the democratic system must be upheld and this is the way to do it.  I reject those observations made by people outside this House.  The democratic system could be upheld in an easier and better way if political parties were properly funded and limitations placed on the amount of money that could be spent on any election or by any candidate.  That is a very important point; there should be some limitation on the amount of money that can be spent.  I am sure the Minister for State, Deputy Wallace, will agree with what I am saying.  During previous elections people with funding displayed their wealth in a vulgar way in areas which <Col N="399" /> could not afford such funding.  That was appalling.  Has the Minister of State some observations on that point?  I now know where that funding came from.  I am glad people rejected that vulgar display of wealth by giving a resounding vote against those candidates.  I am talking about people on whom the £500 deposit has no bearing; they could easily put up £10,000 and still have no problems.  There should be some limitation on the amount of money spent on elections and the House should go into Committee to discuss that aspect.</P>
    <P>My next point relates to students. Students are very politically conscious and it is very unfair and wrong to ask them to travel long distances, for example, from Galway to Dublin or Cork to Dublin, in order to vote.  They should be included in the postal voting system. It is very important that they have a voice in elections at no expense to them.  We have seen buses travelling to Kerry, Waterford and so on bringing students home to vote.  There should be some system whereby students are included in the postal voting system like gardaí and special categories such as invalids.  As my colleague said this morning, people who work at sea should also be included in the postal voting system.  Many fishermen along the south-west coast may not return to shore for up to seven days.  They should be given a postal vote.  This point should also be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We need to look seriously at the deposit of £500.  Some people may say that the deposit is not very high but we should not be seen to exclude anyone from the political system.  The point was made that a number of people should nominate a candidate.  Maybe that is the way forward instead of putting up the money.  The sum of £500 may not be a great deal of money by today's financial standards but it can be excessive for some people.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what I regard as the most important part of the Bill. We had a glorious opportunity of giving a vote to Irish people living abroad but <Col N="400" /> this seems to have been ignored in the Bill.  I am very sorry that this opportunity has been lost.  Two years ago a Bill was introduced in the House which proposed giving our emigrants a vote.  Since then every political party has subscribed to that proposal.  There seems to be a consensus that emigrants should be entitled to vote.  We may not agree on the length of time or the domiciliary conditions but nevertheless all political parties at their conferences and Ard Fheiseanna passed motions in favour of giving emigrants a vote.  It is appalling that we are still debating and arguing this issue at this stage.  We had a long debate on why emigrants should or should not be given a vote.  In fairness to them, some Government members put forward reasons for giving emigrants a vote.  However, it was said that because they were not taxpayers they could not be given a vote.  The futility of that argument can be easily seen.</P>
    <P>We told everyone to vote for the Maastricht Treaty and said we would get £6 billion by way of European funding.  Our emigrants in Holland, Germany, France and Britain have all contributed to that £6 billion.  The money paid in tax by our emigrants working on the Continent is channelled back into this country to build roads, bridges and low river crossings. They have made a contribution to the funding of this country and I would argue this point with anyone.  Such emigrants are part of the taxpaying system; they have channelled plenty of money back into this country through, as it is called invisible means.  Their money has helped to send their brothers and sisters to school and college.  The argument that they should not be given a vote because they are not living here and paying tax is very weak.</P>
    <P>I believe documents have been circulated to people which indicate that everyone is in favour of giving votes to emigrants.  It may be only for a five, ten or 15 year period but at the end of the day no one is prepared to make a decision.  The Minister for the Environment has indicated that he will be making a decision within the next three <Col N="401" /> or four weeks.  This problem has existed for a long time and I must say that when the vote was taken on the 15 March I distinctly remember putting forward the case that emigrants should be a part of our electoral system.  I felt that the argument was a solid one and that it would stand up.  The Government voted it down and the following day the same Ministers jetted out to New York, Australia, Boston and San Francisco, met all the emigrants, took part in the parades and the church services and so on while at home they were saying &ldquo;You are not good enough to have a vote, you are not Irish&rdquo;.  I believe that is appalling.  It is hypocrisy.  It is no wonder there is a very low perception of politicians in this country because when it came to the crunch the Government turned down the proposal. They were not willing to give votes to emigrants, for whatever reason.  I think it was disgraceful that while abroad emigrants were told they were Irish and entitled to vote, at home they were not deemed good enough to be part of our electoral system.  Ministers and Deputies were expressing those views, yet when it came to the crunch emigrants were not good enough to vote here.  From that point of view a golden opportunity has been missed in this Bill.  This problem could have been resolved by a referendum, if it was the case that the Constitution would have to be changed.  Legal opinion states very clearly that that is not the case but had it been the case we could have utilised this Bill and the forthcoming referenda to make emigrants feel that they were part of this country, which they are entitled to do.  I feel very strongly about this issue and I am anxious that it would be discussed in Committee.</P>
    <P>Regarding political activity outside polling stations, we have now reached the stage where it is becoming an ordeal for people to come out to vote.  Elderly people in particular will not bother to vote because they feel they will be hassled at the polling stations.  The canvassing system that is allowed at present is a crazy system.  It costs political parties a lot of money but it is also deterring people from going to the polls.  I realise percentages <Col N="402" /> vary in different elections but when people, especially the elderly, have to face this type of activity at the polling stations it is time that we called a halt to it.  Whether we introduce a complete moratorium, with no canvassing whatsoever on the day of the election, or whether we change to Sunday voting such as they do on the Continent, I feel we should examine all avenues because they are all important matters which will help to make polling day acceptable and encourage people to vote.  At present there is a strong deterrent against voting because of the practices of canvassers over the years.  Money can play a large part in this problem, because one can employ many people at the polling stations who can at times seem to intimidate people going in to vote.  It is very important that people should be allowed to take their time and vote without being hassled on their way into the polling station.  This is one of the main areas that should be addressed in the Bill.  There will never be agreement on the 50 metre exclusion zone because people will encroach on it and move closer and closer to the polling stations.  This may lead to the Garda being called, which would be a crazy situation.  I believe we should forget about that and implement a complete moratorium &mdash; no canvassing whatever on polling day with the exception of people having to be transported to the polling station.  At present people are being completely deterred from coming out to vote, particularly in bad weather, because they do not want to face the hassle at polling stations.</P>
    <P>The other points I wish to make is that students should be entitled to the postal vote, the deposit should be considered and we should examine closely the activities outside polling stations to see if we can eliminate the problem completely. I know it is part of the razzmatazz of elections and we all can get caught up in that feeling, but it is time for change.  We have come to the end of the road when money can be used to employ personnel and print handouts to be used at polling stations.  People should be allowed to <Col N="403" /> make up their own minds and vote accordingly.</P>
    <P>Concerning the emigrant vote, I ask the Minister to reconsider the position and perhaps come up with a solution that will be suitable to everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. M. Barrett Mr. M. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a brief contribution because I know Deputy Sheehan is anxious to speak and we are all anxious to hear him.  I wish to address the problem of canvassing outside polling stations.  This system was introduced many years ago at a time when many people were not well educated.  In my experience in country areas a table would be set up outside the polling station by the various political parties and many people would seek advice from the relevant party canvassers.  That is all changed.  What is being done now is nothing short of intimidation and we have all had experience of this outside polling stations.  It serves no useful purpose.  Any purpose that it previously served has long since past.  As Deputies will remember, years ago the hassle was caused by Opposition candidates whereas with the present system the trouble can be caused by candidates from the one party.  In some cases there is almost open war with perhaps the Garda having to be called.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan when he says that canvassing should be banned completely.  The Minister's proposal to have a 50 metre exclusion zone around the polling stations is a joke.  We are a member of the European Community and I understand that canvassing is not allowed outside polling stations in other European countries.  I worked and lived in England for a number of years and I know it was not permitted there.  On election day people simply walked in and voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe canvassing outside churches should also be banned.  No matter which church it may be people tend to be intimidated by candidates who, in addition to canvassing outside polling stations, travel throughout their constituency handing out literature.  Sometimes when there are three candidates of the one party standing <Col N="404" /> for election constituents will have received the same literature three times. In addition to whatever party literature is distributed there will be personal literature. I contend people have become sick and tired of such election literature.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the provisions of this Bill limit canvassing to within 50 metres of polling stations without there being any mention whatever of canvassing outside churches about which the clergy have become very annoyed.  I think it was in the course of the 1987 general election the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey and his team were removed from church grounds in, I think, the Coolock area, the priests there having become so annoyed at the church being filled with election literature each Sunday.  I ask the Minister to seriously re-examine that practice.</P>
    <P>Nowadays most elections are fought in the media, national and local papers by party Leaders with papers in rural areas giving candidates much coverage.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's comments about those people appointed to preside over polling stations, many of whom are professional people in full employment who take a day's leave to work in the polling stations. I suggest the Minister make legislative provision preferably for the deployment of unemployed people for that purpose. There are many skilled people nowadays who have lost their jobs who should be recruited for that purpose rather than the professionals I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I note with pleasure the proposed change in the electoral register.  As public representatives we have had experience of many constituents tell us on the doorstep or approach us to inform us that their names have not been included on the register.  The new supplementary register will eliminate that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I contend the postal vote should be extended to many people, such as commercial travellers and others who may have to travel at home or abroad in the course of their business and would not be in their locality on polling day.  They should not be denied their franchise.  In addition, people can become ill suddenly <Col N="405" /> and be unable to vote on polling day and some arrangements should be made to facilitate them.</P>
    <P>I agree with everything Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan said about the practice of canvassing at polling stations, it should be banned outright.  After all, we are a member of the European Community: let us do what they do.</P>
    <P>Much can be said about the deposit required of candidates.  The present large deposit can often deprive many people in political parties from coming forward for election.  It has been proved in this House that one does not have to be a professional person to be a good public representative. Indeed, many Members may have left school on completion of primary level without having had an opportunity to follow second or third level education, many of whom will have carried out duties as public representatives just as well as their professional counterparts. Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan made a good point about the level of the deposit, that while there may be a need for its increase it should not be done to the extent that it would prohibit the ordinary working person from going forward for election.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have noted the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill whose improved provisions have been long overdue.  Nonetheless there remain quite a number of problems to be resolved.</P>
      <P>In the course of the drawing up of the Treaty of Accession to the EC I cannot understand why provision was not made to give all EC nationals resident here, many of whom probably will be property owners, the right to vote in elections to Dáil Éireann.  Their right to do so should have been considered long ago.  It is my hope that the Minister's present proposals will rectify their position.  We have tended to be lackadaisical here when it came to changing our electoral Acts over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Members I am somewhat amused at the 50 metre regulation supposed to obtain in regard to canvassing outside polling stations.  I agree with <Col N="406" /> others who have contended that such canvassing outside polling stations should be abolished.  I contend that nowadays every voter leaving his or her home for the polling station knows only too well for whom they will cast their vote.  The present electorate are highly intelligent and are provided with full details about candidates on their television screens and newspapers.  I am firmly of the view that, regardless of what canvassing may be undertaken outside polling stations, it does not change the mind of one in one hundred people who enter that polling station.  I have witnessed gurriers from different parties &mdash; perhaps mine included &mdash; attempt to change voters' minds on entering polling stations.  I have also witnessed active, perhaps overenthusiastic, party workers press leaflets into the hands and pockets of voters, mesmerising them to such an extent that those same people must often question why they came out to vote at all.  I contend that if anything was geared to deter a voter from entering a polling station and casting his or her vote it would be that outlandish conduct which we public representatives here should not tolerate. We should make it known to everybody that it is the intention under the provisions of this Bill to allow every voter, irrespective of party, class or creed, the right to walk into a polling station in a dignified manner, receive, mark and deposit their ballot paper in the ballot box, departing from the precinct with the same dignity.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the regulation prohibiting canvassing within 50 metres of polling stations is a farce.  For example, who will insist that that 50 metre regulation be observed?  Will it be the Garda? We must remember that in many rural areas a Garda may have to oversee three or four polling stations because they may not be sufficient in number to cover polling stations individually.  I predict that in the last half hour on polling day those 50 metres might well be reduced to five or even one metre from the polling station. Indeed, I have witnessed activists inside polling stations, practically following voters to the presiding officer in an <Col N="407" /> endeavour to convince them to give them their number one vote.  The Minister should delete that 50 metre regulation altogether and totally ban such canvassing outside polling stations.</P>
    <P>The last referendum held here was a very normal one when voters entered polling stations without anybody apprehending them, when they were loud in praise of that conduct, voicing the hope that they would see that same conduct adhered to in the course of all other elections here, which I am sure would be the wish of all Members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its shameful record on Overseas Aid and reaffirms the commitment to attaining the United Nations' target of 0.7 per cent of GNP within seven years by annual increases of not less than .07 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>It is obscene that in a world with full and plenty there are 3,000 people dying every day from starvation in Somalia.  It is even more obscene that sufficient resources have not been committed in good time by governments and international agencies to support the magnificent efforts of voluntary aid workers to reduce the death toll there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many others, I share the sense of pride which is widespread in Ireland that our President has taken such a leading role in focusing international attention on that famine.  I also share fully the sense of shame expressed by President <Col N="408" /> Robinson that such appalling inhumanity could occur in this age and in our time.  I certainly hope that the visit by our President will be the spark to ignite the nations from their selfish lethargy in responding to famine, disease and want in Somalia and elsewhere throughout the Third World.  I salute President Robinson for the efforts she is making and I hope these efforts will lead to an explosion of support at United Nations, EC and national levels.</P>
    <P>The generosity of the Irish people in their voluntary contributions to the aid agencies operating in Somalia and elsewhere throughout the Third World is also something of which we can be very proud.  We should also record our appreciation of the aid workers and missionaries in Somalia, throughout Africa and the developing world who are such worthy ambassadors for Ireland and bring such enormous credit to our country.</P>
    <P>Against this background Ireland should be in a position to encourage the nations of the world to follow the Irish example and to contribute in proportion to their resources, as suggested by the President, so that hunger and want can be challenged now in Somalia and elsewhere and development co-operation can be properly funded throughout the Third World.  Sadly, that is not the case.  The legacy of this Government is the shameful record which we now have as the nation with the lowest level of official aid in the developed world.  Even in relation to the moneys allocated by Ireland to Somalia from the aid budget, no Supplementary Estimate has been proposed, in the absence of which it must be assumed that these moneys have been reallocated from other international co-operation activities.  Robbing hungry Peter to feed starving Paul is no answer to world want.</P>
    <P>Clearly this Government feel they can get by with platitudes and rhetoric, hoping no doubt that when the Somalia crisis is over and compassion fatigue sets in, the attention of our people will be redirected from the need for solidarity with the Third World.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> That is why I reject the Government amendment &mdash; not for what is in it but rather because of what is not in it.  Of course the sentiments expressed are correct but the sentiment is no substitute for hard cash.  We are asked in the Government amendment to commend the Government on positive efforts made to draw attention to the plight of the starving people in Somalia.  I do, and I appreciated the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, in so doing.  It also refers to the assistance provided through the high quality of Ireland's bilateral aid programme. When I had ministerial responsibility I visited the Irish aid workers, official and voluntary, and their work was of a very high standard.  There is no problem in approving that.  We are asked to note the Government's commitment in the Programme for Government to undertake a planned programme of increases in Ireland's official development assistance. We all know about that.  We are asked to salute the Irish people, which I have already done, and pay tribute to the work of the Irish non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>Where is the commitment to the United Nations target or to any financial framework in which that target can be achieved?  Let us be blunt; without that we are left at Government level with empty rhetoric.  It is time to reconfirm our commitment to the United Nations target of 7 per cent of GNP.  More importantly, it is time to set out how this can and will be achieved and to have the agreement of all parties in the Dáil to that financial framework.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of how difficult it is to obtain increased resources when Estimates are being prepared annually.  I had ministerial responsibility for five years for the aid programme up to 1986 and know the sustained and persistent effort needed to increase our GNP percentage which ultimately reached .26 per cent in 1986.  The percentage has however, collapsed in the meantime.  We are now back at .17 per cent and have the doubtful record of being at the bottom of the <Col N="410" /> league with the worst performance in the developed world.</P>
    <P>I do not move this motion on behalf of Fine Gael for the purpose of berating Fianna Fáil and their coalition partners with cynical hypocrisy or even benign neglect.  The shameful record speaks for itself.  I am more interested in looking to the future.  I want all parties to reconfirm our commitment to the United Nations target of .7 per cent of GNP.  More importantly I want all parties to agree to the Fine Gael proposal that this be achieved by minimum annual increases of at least .07 per cent so that during this decade the target can be achieved.</P>
    <P>So often I have seen in the past sentimental rhetoric coupled with vague promises which are always carefully drafted to provide an escape hatch.  This is not acceptable any longer.  We need to be clear, positive and unequivocal in our commitment.  That is what I am seeking from the Dáil tonight.</P>
    <P>If we accept that it is obscene that thousands should die of starvation in a world of full and plenty, we will agree this commitment.  We will share the sense of anger, frustration and distress of those who have personally witnessed those scenes of death and degradation in Somalia. My colleague, Deputy Higgins, will be able to tell us about it.  I have not seen it in Somalia but I saw it in Ethiopia and elsewhere and I am sure the circumstances are no different.  The death and degradation which are so obvious at the height of a famine leave a searing impression and induce a commitment to ensure as far a possible that such famines will not happen again.  The problem is that they do happen again.  I was in Ethiopia in 1984.  There was a huge response at that time but then the world forgot. There was famine in Sudan years later and now there is famine in Somalia. Unless there is a sustained commitment, famines will occur and recur over and over again.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about Somalia. We are talking about the countless millions throughout the Third World who are perpetually under threat of starvation. We are talking of the 40,000 children <Col N="411" /> who die every day from malnutrition and preventable disease.  We are talking of the half million refugees in Kenya and in so many other countries.  Essentially we have a long standing moral debt through our commitment to the UN target which will not be erased by periodic contributions of conscience money.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of whether we can afford to pay our proper dues.  Essentially we have no moral voice whatever if we, the 25th richest nation out of 180 in the world, do not accept our share of responsibility.  How can we legitimately demand of others to do what we are not prepared to do ourselves?  It is not as if we are talking of sums which are beyond our capacity.</P>
    <P>It is also worth bearing in mind that we ourselves are enormous beneficiaries, as one of the poorer members of the European league, to the tune of over £1,000 million a year through our membership of the European Community.  We have no hesitation in seeking the solidarity of the richer countries of the EC and in accepting all the grant aid and funding that is going because of that sense of solidarity which is part of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is also worth bearing in mind that the Irish economy gains enormously because of our involvement in development co-operation and it is estimated that contracts for semi-state bodies and others through EC and UN funded operations in the Third World bring in an income of over three times the amount which we are subscribing in official aid.</P>
    <P>Many years ago we made a commitment to the United Nations target. We have not discharged that commitment. It is time that we reconfirmed our commitment and established the means by which it will be discharged. This is the purpose of the motion before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We stand shamed before the world if once again we accept the banal phrases of the Government amendment.  We undermine the outstanding work of our President if we are not prepared to back <Col N="412" /> her and our words with cash.  Above all we share the shame and guilt of responsibility for the effects of hunger and want in the world if we are not prepared to provide from our table the crumbs of support needed to allow us to discharge as a country our commitment to the UN target on overseas aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like Deputies to picture the following scene.  It is 3 o'clock in the afternoon, temperatures are in the high 90 degrees and the sound of babies crying is all around.  Inside a large shed mothers, babies and young children sit waiting to be fed.  Sitting alone on a piece of sacking is a young mother suckling a baby.  The baby appears to be about six months old.  Sitting beside her is a seven year old child holding a tiny baby in her arms.  The young mother has a deep serious wound on her arm as a result of falling into a cooking fire and not having the strength to lift herself out of it.  It turns out that both babies are the same age &mdash; in fact they are twins &mdash; but this young mother because of her own physical condition has had to make a decision to breast feed only one of the babies, namely, the boy and allow the baby girl to die.  That baby girl is relegated to die because of the condition of the mother. This is not a pen picture of one of the recent scenes which confronted our President, Mary Robinson, in Somalia. Instead, it is my own experience in Ethiopia in 1986 at the end of the famine there and, like Deputy O'Keeffe, one of the indelible memories I will take to my grave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly and tragically, things have not changed, as we can see watching on our television screens the horrific pictures coming from Somalia.  Where are all the world leaders who in 1985 said that the kind of tragedy that happened in Ethiopia must never happen again?  Where are all the commitments given at that time to development aid and assistance for the Third World to address the underlying underdevelopment which often leads to the kind of famine we are now witnessing in Somalia?  Unfortunately, once the world's attention is drawn to <Col N="413" /> some other story of the day, the difficulties of Africa and other developing countries are banished from our minds and it is not until the television cameras produce the horror pictures again that the world once more sits up and takes notice for a short while.</P>
    <P>Only a few short months ago the Irish media were filled with stories from Bosnia and former Yugoslavia.  Every discussion programme covered the issue. Where is that story now?  It is probably covered on pages four or five in our newspapers, if at all.  Somalia is currently in the headlines because eventually the world was forced to take notice.</P>
    <P>As a Member of this House who has taken an interest in the issue of development for all the years that I have been here, can I say that it has been a relatively lonely position to take, with only a small handful of Deputies taking a long term interest and acting year in and year out as a goad to whatever Government are in power to increase our development aid budget.</P>
    <P>While paying a warm tribute to our President, Mary Robinson, and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, I am devastated this evening by the wording of the Government's motion &mdash; not a single word of commitment for the kind of increases that the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State have promised over the last few days and weeks.  Are we to believe that as soon as the media loses interest in Somalia, which is quite likely to happen now that the high profile visit of the President is over, the Government will be able to slip back into their old ways and ignore our overseas development aid budget?</P>
    <P>Last November, when this Government re-negotiated the coalition with the Progressive Democrats, they included a statement indicating that there would be a steady increase in Aid between 1992 and 1994 and at the very first opportunity &mdash; the budget of 1992 &mdash; not only did we see no increase but we actually saw a decrease in the percentage given per GNP.</P>
    <P>Over one billion people, a fifth of mankind, <Col N="414" /> still lack adequate food, clean water, elementary education and basic health care and until the world faces up to this horrific condition of a fifth of mankind, then there can be no real advance towards a genuinely civilised and environmentally sustainable one world society.  The gross inequity and absolute poverty that we have witnessed on our television screens cannot continue if we in the developed world are to live in peace and prosperity.  Eventually the poor of the world will rise up against the better off and demand real justice.</P>
    <P>Recent UNICEF reports indicate that in many countries poverty, child malnutrition and ill health are advancing again after some decades of positive improvements.  The overshadowing reason for this has to be the indebtedness of many of the developing world countries where they are devoting half of their total annual expenditures to the servicing of debt and or also the maintenance of their military structures.  Both these activities are unproductive in assisting the people of these countries and are now costing the nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America almost $1 billion every day or more than $400 a year for each family in the developing world.  This $400 represents in some instances four times the annual income of a family in a Third World country and from which they have to provide food, clean water, shelter and housing for their families.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went to the UNCED Conference in Brazil earlier this year and in front of the whole world gained brownie points by stating how concerned and active Ireland was.  He was, of course, trying to share the limelight with the many excellent non-governmental organisations which are working on behalf of the Irish people in the Third World and which are collecting huge voluntary donations from the same Irish people.  This is not matched by a commitment from the Government and has never, in fact, been matched by Fianna Fáil when they have been in Government. The one major time when co-financing to NGOs was cut was in the <Col N="415" /> Fianna Fáil budget of 1981, which was a devastating blow to the NGOs.</P>
    <P>If one examines the record of the ODA budget since 1987, one will see that we are now the lowest contributor of the OECD countries.  Our own Irish agencies, such as Trocaire, Concern and GOAL and a number of other agencies such as Campaign Aid and the Mozambique Solidarity Group that are part of a worldwide network, are now raising more money in co-financing from the British Government and from the EC than from their own Government.  For example, in the year ended 1991 Concern got donations from the British Government of over £3 million in co-financing and a further £3.5 million from the EC. During that time the Irish Government donated only £600,000 approximately compared to this £6.5 million from other agencies.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of the respect for the work our non-governmental agencies are doing; they are giving Ireland the image of a caring society.  It is not matched by the Government.  Why can the Government not, like the Canadian Government match pound for pound the money raised from the public?  Fine Gael have consistently offered the Government an opportunity to introduce supplementary estimates.  We still do not even know whether the extra money for Somalia this year will be taken from some other Estimate which we will not find out about soon enough to cry &ldquo;halt&rdquo;.  Is this additional money?  The Minister should tell us that tonight.  Fianna Fáil have never taken up the offer from this side of the House to introduce a supplementary estimate.  That speaks louder than words. That is a sign of the lack of real commitment to the most vulnerable people in the world.</P>
    <P>This motion calls on the Government to give a steady increase of 0.07 per cent annually until we reach the UN target of 0.7 per cent.  We were supposed to meet that target over ten years ago.  We are only at 0.17 per cent of GNP this year and that is an indictment of the Government. When we left office in 1986 there had <Col N="416" /> been a regular increase year by year.  If that increase had been maintained we could now hold our heads high at international fora and indicate that we mean what we say.  Instead we saw a tiny increase because of the Iraq war but the minute that was over we went back down to 0.17 per cent.  I hope the Taoiseach realises that the time has come to move away from his folksy catch-all image and make a real commitment on something as essential as this.  The Taoiseach's star will be very tarnished at EC level if there is not an increase in the 1993 budget.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the first Foreign Minister from the developed world to go to Somalia and highlight the conditions there.  I hope his status at the Cabinet table is high enough to ensure that the commitments we have heard over the last few weeks will become a reality and that Fianna Fáil will no longer be able to renege on our moral and Christian responsibility to the peoples of the least well off nations of the world.</P>

      <P>Tá lúcháir orm labhairt ar an rún tábhachtach seo atá curtha os comhair an Tí ag mo chomhghleacaithe, na Teachtaí O'Keeffe agus Nora Owen.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting of very concerned people in my constituency last Monday night, the Twin Towns Concern Action Group.  They brought a number of public representatives in Donegal together to express their concern at the record of the Government and their immediate predecessor on overseas aid.  What was discussed at the meeting was very much in line with the sentiments expressed in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people have a deep commitment to the alleviation of hunger, famine and want in every part of the world.  There is always a very positive response at local level from Irish people when appeals are made.  That is understandable because it is in the Irish psyche. In the 19th century we experienced famine and every schoolboy and girl learns about it.  What is happening in other countries strikes a deep chord in the Irish consciousness and there is always a <Col N="417" /> positive response.  There is not a parish in Ireland who have not organised events to raise funds for the alleviation of famine in the Third World.  Our President by her visit to Africa has given us all a lead and has set an example to Government as to what should be done.  There is a deep commitment, from the President to those in the smallest parish, and we should respond.</P>
    <P>My two colleagues dwelt on the record of the Government since 1987.  Instead of increasing ODA, as we undertook to do in the seventies, under a UN Resolution, there has been a steady decline in our contribution to ODA.  As Deputy Owen said, our contribution is at its lowest level ever, at 0.17 per cent of GNP.  This does not reflect the wishes or the aspirations of the Irish people.  When I arrived in Dublin this afternoon I found on my desk a beautiful booklet outlining Ireland's official development assistance to the Third World.  In it there was a foreword from the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, telling of his support.  The booklet deals with what is going on in the various parts of the world and the assistance we are giving.  On the last page there is a photograph of the Minister with other personnel.  I wonder how much it cost and how many copies were published. I got one and I am sure every other Member got one.  I wonder how many children and young people in Africa would have been kept alive with the money it cost to produce this document.</P>
    <P>Somalia is only a symptom of the difficulties in the Third World.  It is Somalia in 1992, it was Ethiopia in 1984 and Biafra some years before that.  Only God knows what part of Africa will be in crisis next year or the year after.  What we are doing is worthy and we have to send as much as we can to save life, but if we want to tackle the root causes of the difficulties in the Third World, and in Africa in particular, we will need more than a simple fire brigade exercise.  We have to tackle the root causes.  There must be a substantial transfer of resources from the developed world to the Third World.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe, my colleague, said <Col N="418" /> that we are among the richest countries in the world.  We are one of the 18 OECD countries but our contribution, at 0.17 per cent, is far less than that of any other country.  If we average all the other contributions, they pay double what we pay. Until there is a substantial transfer of resources from the developed world to the Third World we will have recurring disasters.  I am disappointed that the Government amendment does not indicate any significant increase in the assistance we will give next year or the following year.  Last year in the Joint Programme for Government, the Government reaffirmed their commitment to increasing the overseas development funding in the period 1992 to 1994.  However, there is little evidence that they are seriously contemplating or planning to increase our percentage of GNP to overseas aid.  This undertaking in the Government's programme seems to have about as much validity and sincerity as many other promises in it.</P>
    <P>Any extra moneys will have the support of the Irish people who give on a voluntary basis consistently.  They contribute voluntarily and they do so consistently in every part of the country. Indeed the poorer the parish the more <i>per capita</i> is contributed.  The Bishops' Conference, Concern, Trócaire and all the other voluntary agencies who are doing such good work will bear me out in that.  Irish people have no objection to putting their hands in their pockets and contributing towards the alleviation of these problems because our forefathers also experienced these problems.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister and the Government to substantially increase our contribution and to strive towards bringing it up to .7 per cent of GNP before the end of the century.  When and if we do that we will be in a position to publish nice colourful booklets telling what we are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's amendment to this motion aims to make it more relevant to the substance of this evening's debate.  It does not confine itself to funding but covers issues such as the quality of aid, the generosity of private contributions, the work of Irish non-governmental organisations and the situation in Somalia.</P>
      <P>The horror of what is happening in Somalia and what seems almost certain to happen in Mozambique has shocked us all.  It has brought an immediate and unique response from the people of this country.  There are few towns and villages in Ireland which have not launched initiatives to raise funds for the aid agencies which are working so magnificently in Somalia and other parts of the developing world.</P>
      <P>The visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in August was the first by any Foreign Minister and was instrumental in focusing the attention of the world on one of the most serious humanitarian problems since the Ethiopian famine in the mid-eighties.</P>
      <P>President Robinson and the Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Somalia and the Somali refugee camps in Kenya last week-end.  She did so at the request of the Irish aid agencies who are doing such excellent work in Somalia and who were concerned that the plight of that country should be brought to the attention of the world.</P>
      <P>The President's visit and her obvious distress at the scenes which she witnessed have moved us all.  It will rekindle the determination which the people of this country and the Government have shown to ensure that the help so urgently needed by Somalia is delivered without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government reacted quickly to the crisis with the donation of an additional £500,000.  This has been allocated  <Col N="421" /> to the Irish relief agencies who are working on the ground in Somalia.  This contribution raises our assistance to Somalia to £655,000 this year.  We are also contributing through the United Nations and in our participation in the EC's programme of emergency assistance which has so far provided 253,000 tonnes of food aid.</P>
    <P>We must also think of the longer-term needs of the Somali people and provide them with the kind of assistance which will allow them to begin to take charge of their own destiny.</P>
    <P>The Government have provided £125,000 from the bilateral aid fund to launch a seed distribution programme to be run in the Baidoa catchment area.  This will immediately benefit 6,000 people by providing them with the seeds and equipment to begin planting as the rainy seasons approach.  It will also act as an incentive to attract dislocated people back to their villages.</P>
    <P>Since his visit to Somalia in August, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has worked assiduously within the European Community and at the United Nations to ensure that the efforts of the international community to assist the Somali people and the many aid agencies working in the field are maintained and increased.</P>
    <P>We have called for the Commission's presence on the ground in Somalia so that the flow and effectiveness of Community aid can be monitored, and the UN's efforts at achieving a political settlement can be supported at first hand.</P>
    <P>We are aware that there are serious problems with the distribution of aid and we are giving our full support to the UN Secretary General's representative, Ambassador Sahnoun, who is vigorously promoting improved security.  We welcome the deployment of UN troops which at last seems to be getting under way.</P>
    <P>We are working to promote a political solution.  The holding of a national conciliation conference is essential for the long term recovery of Somalia and there are now some positive signs that some progress is being made in that regard. <Col N="422" /> The news that the leaders of the two warring factions appear to be willing to attend a peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations is welcome. Every support must be provided to ensure the success of this peace initiative.</P>
    <P>In the discussions which take place on the issue of human rights in the developing world, it is too easy to overlook the fundamental right of all men to food and shelter.  When, as in the case of Somalia, the needs are so immense and the deprivation of the people so enormous, existing international structures seem powerless to reach in time with the necessary levels of resources whether they be financial or in kind.</P>
    <P>We have seen how in Somalia, it was the non-governmental organisations that were the first to highlight the scale of the catastrophe and alert the international community to the forthcoming disaster. They were the first to begin emergency feeding programmes and have at last been heard as international support begins to pour in at the levels which are required.</P>
    <P>The European Community was among the first of the international donors to react but we must ask ourselves if there are not improvements that could be made in our procedures so that food and other vital supplies reach those areas where there is dire need.</P>
    <P>The need for a rapid response to emerging catastrophes such as Somalia must now be examined in the light of the tragic experiences that delays in supplying emergency relief supplies have caused in Somalia.  While disaster relief is vitally important, longer term relief and investment which can prevent tragedies like Somalia taking place is most important.</P>
    <P>In the world economy, the least developed countries in Africa where Ireland targets its main ODA have become even more marginalised &mdash; falling further behind developed and developing countries alike.  Living conditions in the least developed countries have deteriorated significantly during the eighties.</P>
    <P>Economic growth reached only an <Col N="423" /> average of 2.5 per cent, significantly below the rate of population increase. Income per head of population fell to an average annual figure of $200.</P>
    <P>Agricultural growth rates are also inadequate. As a result, the already precarious situation especially of the rural population, where the most widespread poverty exists, has been further threatened. The livelihoods of the rural population are increasingly threatened by the continuing process of environmental degradation which undermines the agricultural resources base.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland established its own bilateral aid programme in 1974 it has made a distinctively Irish contribution to development through the provision of forms of technical assistance in which Ireland has a special interest or competence. Within the bilateral aid programme, assistance is concentrated on four &ldquo;priority countries&rdquo;&mdash; Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania and the Sudan.  These rank among the least developed countries in the world.</P>
    <P>I have recently visited three of the priority countries &mdash; Tanzania, Zambia and Lesotho.  While nothing in those countries can compare to the tragedy of the people of Somalia, I was shocked at the situation of the people I met.  It is only by visiting Africa and seeing the living conditions of the poorest people strugging to exist and provide for their families that an idea can be had of the enormous efforts required to provide them with even a minimum standard of living.</P>
    <P>In each of the countries that I visited I was given the opportunity to meet many community leaders and politicians.  I met the Prime Minister of Tanzania and a number of his Government ministers.  I also met the President of Zambia and seven out of eight Government Ministers, including the Foreign Minister, in Lesotho.  Each one asked me to express at the first available opportunity their deep appreciation of the Irish effort in their countries.  They wanted me to make it known that they value the commitment of the Irish personnel working overseas, <Col N="424" /> to put on record their deep appreciation of the work being done and to highlight the necessity to continue and accelerate that work.  They would certainly like me to avail of this opportunity to put on record their gratitude and deep appreciation and that of the political and community leaders in towns and villages of the work being done and the efforts being made by Irish personnel overseas in these difficult areas.  They are indebted to them and would like to appeal for further aid and assistance in these difficult and trying times.</P>
    <P>Ireland plays an active part in those international organisations such as the European Community, the United Nations and the World Bank through which aid is channelled.  Ireland's official development assistance is likely to total £42.7 million in 1992.  Two thirds of that, or almost £28 million, will go to programmes of multilateral assistance while the balance of £15 million is spent on Ireland's bilateral aid programme.  In addition to the funds allocated to the four priority countries, significant resources are provided through disaster relief operations and to fund volunteers abroad through the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.  The overall amount is slightly lower than the figure of £45 million provided in 1991.  This amounts to 0.17 per cent of gross national product.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade, 1981-91, Ireland has allocated almost £382 million in aid, in cash terms.  Allocations increased steadily up to 1985-86 when they reached a plateau in gross national product terms of 0.24 per cent.  A figure of 0.26 per cent is usually quoted for 1986, but is not strictly accurate, as it is based on a preliminary estimate of the outturn.  The final outturn was £40.5 million, which represents, as I have said, 0.24 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael-Labour Coalition set a target in <i>Building on Reality</i> of increasing ODA by 0.015 per cent a year.  It would have taken about 30 years at that rate of progress to achieve the United Nations target.  ODA was relegated to the very end of Fine Gael's 1987 election manifesto <i>Breaking out of the vicious circle</i><Col N="425" /> and all specific targets were dropped, as Deputy O'Keeffe knows well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We produced results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is important to recognise therefore that the accelerated progress which Deputy O'Keeffe and others are now proposing from the Opposition benches is of a very different order of magnitude from what they considered feasible when they were in Government. Indeed, in their 1987 draft Estimates, they admitted that their proposals for that year fell short even of the <i>Building on Reality target.</i></P>
      <P>Since then, while there has been a decline in GNP terms, the amounts allocated have been substantial, and last year alone reached an all-time high in nominal terms &mdash; almost £45.5 million or 0.19 per cent of gross national product.  This represented a maginally higher proportion of total Government expenditure than the 1986 level of aid, while this year it may be marginally below that level.</P>
      <P>It has to be kept in mind that in the intervening period, Government expenditure has been cut back from 55 per cent of GNP in 1986 to around 41 per cent since 1989.  In that process, the bilateral aid programme was at least preserved intact, albeit at a somewhat lower level.</P>
      <P>I do not deny that our level of aid is among the lowest of the developed countries.  I would, however, like to draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that the United States ODA contribution reached only 0.19 per cent of GNP in 1990, and they are one of the richest countries in the world, and to the fact that certain other wealthy countries, such as Britain, are planning to cut back on their ODA at the present time.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on record the commitment in the Programme for Government &ldquo;to undertake a planned programme of increases in Ireland's Official Development Assistance, 1992-1994, so as to achieve a higher ODA/GNP contribution by the end of that period&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the longstanding commitment to reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>The Government are fully conscious of the generosity of the Irish people in the contribution they make to the Third World.  Private support in Ireland for non-governmental organisations involved in development has steadily grown so that, today, Ireland has the highest rate of private development assistance, as a proportion of GNP, of any country in the world.</P>
      <P>In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the Irish Government aim to respond to the generosity of the Irish people by increasing our official development assistance.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is at present examining ways in which it might be possible to increase Ireland's overall level of aid flows in the coming years.  I would like to assure Deputies that money spent on programmes of development assistance is money well spent.  Our aid programme is achieving very effective results and is very much appreciated, as I have said, in recipient countries which I recently visited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Tanzania, which geographically is the size of France and Germany combined, I was shocked by the scenes of deprivation and human misery but, on the other hand, it is the great wish of political leaders and communities that they will be able to find ways by which they can resolve their problems in partnership and not be dictated to by people from outside.  For example, I visited a technical school in a rural area which was built with Irish funds.  That school is being assisted by personnel from FÁS who are providing the training and expertise that is of vital importance in Tanzania.  In every area of activity, be it in the skills or technical area, there is a huge demand for training and skills.  We have been making a big contribution in that area.  I have no doubt as to the practical value of this school to Tanzania bearing in mind the severe shortages of skilled labour of every kind. <Col N="427" /> As a consequence, the economic development of Tanzania is hampered due to the lack of basic skills.</P>
    <P>I visited a number of schools where we are involved in the provision of facilities and personnel.  With the Minister, I visited some water schemes established with assistance from Ireland that are providing water supplies to medical services and hospitals.  I was particularly impressed in Zambia by the Irish assisted project of building and rehabilitating basic maternity facilities in the poorest district of Lusaka.  Its importance in ensuring safe deliveries for thousands of Lusaka mothers and infants was stressed to me by the Zambian authorities.  I met their Minister for Health, who is very conscious of the necessity for further investment in this area and of the training we give both here and overseas in a whole range of medical services which are so essential in many parts of Zambia.</P>
    <P>I also had the opportunity to visit a cement plant there.  Irish personnel provided technical support in building this project which is now producing half a million tonnes of cement each year, a product which is essential for the construction industry and is in very short supply in Zambia.  The people there are very keen that we continue to support them in a technical way by providing personnel from here and providing training for personnel who come here from Zambia so that they can take over, manage and run their own industries, such as the cement industry.  It is important that we continue to undertake this kind of work.  I had an opportunity in Zambia and Tanzania to see in what respect we could further assist and support projects such as these.  The problem in Somalia today is a symptom of the underlying problem of the lack of investment in a whole range of activities.  Enormous problems will arise in many other areas also unless massive investment, well organised and with the back-up of technical support and advice, is provided.</P>
    <P>In each of the countries in which we work we target the poorest sectors of <Col N="428" /> the population.  We help to provide the essential ingredients for a decent and dignified standard of living for the people. A criticism of our effort has been that we have been working in the educational, technical and health areas to the detriment of the poorest sections of the community, but I refute that suggestion. Anyone who has been to these countries will realise that the Irish organisations there work with the poorest and least well off sections of the community.  I was very impressed by the dedication and commitment of the people who are working in terrible conditions and I would like to put on record our appreciation of the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>Despite its modest size, Ireland's aid programme is one of the more effective of national aid programmes and meets the basic needs approach which is at the heart of our bilaterial aid programme. This was highlighted on numerous occasions to me and the officials who accompanied me by the people working there who are crying out for more assistance, technical and financial, to ensure that they can get on with the work they are doing.  These people are working with the poorest sections of the community and are making great efforts at times of enormous difficulties.</P>
    <P>Irish aid programmes are delivering help and saving lives.  We are providing basic water supplies, health care and educational services while not neglecting areas of real poverty which are often aggravated by shortages of food and medical supplies which are so essential for survival.  The Irish programmes are people-centred and reach out effectively to those most in need.  Groups such as villagers, the urban unemployed, the disabled and particularly women are given special priority.  I visited a number of schemes where tremendous work is being done with very limited resources and with enormous beneficial impact, especially for women, in rural villages and isolated local communities.</P>
    <P>For sustainable development to become a reality it is necessary for peace and stability to return to those lands where ethnic, religious and tribal divisions have <Col N="429" /> destroyed it.  The end of East-West power struggles must bring better prospects for future peace in Africa.  The widespread presence of modern weaponry resulting from super-power manoeuvring has been a major factor accounting for war on the continent of Africa.</P>
    <P>Twenty years of war in the Horn of Africa have caused more damage than the worst droughts.  These wars have led to Africa having the highest levels of displaced persons in the world.  Many of these people are the ones who guarantee the food supply in their countries of origin.  They are the farmers who know how to farm and traders who know how to trade.  Without them the chances of sustainable development establishing itself are slim indeed.</P>
    <P>The establishment of democracy in African countries and the development of new economic structures need urgent financial and technical support from the European Community and other donors. This is essential if the democratic ideal is to take root and be respected from schools through to the legal system and to those in administration and political life.  Democracy must be associated with improved living conditions.</P>
    <P>Instability and political manipulation can spring from all sectors of the population but especially in urban areas where hunger and poverty encourage a longing for a return to authoritarianism.  Economic reform must therefore be accompanied by measures which protect the most vulnerable and soften the hardships which such reforms cause, no matter how necessary they may be.</P>
    <P>These are some of the fundamental objectives to which we can contribute through our programme of bilateral assistance and within the European Community and the United Nations.  By tackling the structural imbalances in the countries which we aid and by participating in efforts to strengthen the capacities of the countries to help themselves, we can make a lasting and worthwhile impact on the lives of the citizens of those countries.</P>
    <P>The need for adequate financial resources to carry out a respectable and <Col N="430" /> effective level of assistance has and will be a constant theme of this debate.  I can assure Deputies that the Government will take account of the concerns expressed and will examine carefully what can be done to make more funding available.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland can be enormously proud of the dedication and skill of the many volunteers and experts who are prepared to work in often difficult and frequently dangerous conditions to improve the circumstances of the most marginalised groups of society in developing countries.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to all Irish aid workers and missionaries overseas; to the large number of volunteers &mdash; many of them young people &mdash; who are working in the feeding kitchens of Somalia and before that in Ethiopia; to the nurses working in the field hospitals with inadequate medical supplies and equipment; to the engineers who are restoring basic water supplies and sanitation to villages abandoned and destroyed as a result of war.  All of these people deserve our respect and gratitude and I am sure that all sides of the House would wish to join with me in sending them our support and encouragement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Somalia and his recent speech at the UN and in particular his reference to peace and justice as a principle of international policy; calls on the Government to immediately restore ODA to its 1986 level of 0.25 per cent of GNP; reaffirms its commitment to the UN target of .7 of the one per cent of GNP and to progressively increase ODA so as to achieve the UN target as quickly as possible and not later than the end of the decade; calls on the Government to indicate its support within the European Community and international forums for such strategies as will alleviate <Col N="431" /> the debt burden and discrimination in trade which is affecting so many countries with chronic food shortages and under development; and further calls on the Government to take initiatives in relation to these matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a unique opportunity to respond to what our President and others, including myself, have experienced in the recent events in Somalia.  The motion before us suggests that Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for their shameful record on overseas aid and reaffirms the commitment to attaining the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP within seven years by annual increases of not less than .07 per cent of GNP.  Those are sentiments with which I would not disagree.</P>
    <P>My amendment makes significant changes to the motion.  It makes specific reference to Somalia.  It accepts the major change in our foreign policy which was signalled in the recent speech at the United Nations by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, particularly regarding peace and justice.  It suggests beginning at a higher point, because the wording of the motion would mean it would take until next year to reach the 1985-86 level.  It also enables you to reach the target faster if economic conditions make it possible, it puts an outer lip on the achievement of the UN Charter and it very specifically refers to the issues of debt and trade.</P>
    <P>I should like to say why the amendment is worded in this way.  I was on a recent television programme where a young man from the financial world said at the end that he admired my compassion but that I was very bad at economics.  I am not interested in vanity when I say that I lectured in economics for part of my life, but it is very important to stop this nonsense of dividing aid, compassion and concern from issues of economics.  I offer this amendment to the House in a spirit of consensus.  Will we be thanked by the public for responding to the President's dramatic appearance on television by being partisan?  I offer this amendment in the spirit of trying to get all parties in <Col N="432" /> this House to move forward from what we have seen dramatically most recently. It is possible, for example, to agree a meeting between the spokespersons in the Department of Foreign Affairs and leaders of the parties to take overseas development aid from the whole question of the Estimates and reach agreement on it.  It is also very important &mdash; I emphasise this &mdash; that when we establish a Foreign Affairs Committee the question of development aid must be within that committee and strongly represented, not as it has been for so long, a neglected part of our general concern for foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>In tabling this amendment I want to make it very clear that I do not for a second doubt the sincerity of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his two visits to Somalia, or his commitment in his speech to the United Nations.  At this point in the tragic history of Africa it behoves us to trust each other and to help each other to go forward.  The Minister in going to Cabinet will have the support of my party if he goes down that road.  I will go further, his speech to the United Nations was one of the most significant ever given by an Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs in recent times.  I welcome that and take this opportunity to compliment him on it.</P>
    <P>There are some points about which we should be very clear.  Let us for a start not fall into the trap of imagining that the problems of Africa are Africa's creation only.  For example, in the Minister's speech there is an interesting section referring to building democracy.  Who lent to the élites in Africa?  Who sold weapons to the élites in Africa?  Who set up the colonial élites to deprive the people of basic access to water, education and shelter?  The North of the world did so, so let us nail the lie that Africa is dying because of the characteristics of Africans.  There are countries in the European Community and in the North of the planet which are selling the weapons of death to this Continent which is plagued by so many problems.  They are making profits from these sales.  The European Community, when speaking <Col N="433" /> about its evolution, did not put into treaties like that concluded at Maastricht any prohibition on arms sales or dissemination. They stand condemned when the President speaks of shame on television.  Let us remember that the words will die on our lips if we also imagine that the problems of Africa are not connected to issues of debt and trade, which I specifically mentioned in my amendment.</P>
    <P>Is it acceptable that in 1991 $50 billion was transferred from the South &mdash; where 80 per cent of the population of the planet consume 17 per cent of the resources &mdash; to the North.  In 1988, $43 billion was transferred and $38 billion in 1987.  Now let us stand back and listen to all the people who are represented in international political groupings around the world.  As the threat of famine in Africa and different parts of the world was increasing the South was putting more into servicing debt.  Equally, primary producing countries were experiencing one set of restrictions after another in relation to their capacity to trade in the North.  It is gross hypocrisy to suggest that the North is not involved.</P>
    <P>I had hoped when I spoke here this evening that there would be a response, a change of mind, which would enable people to say that they would make a new start in relation to economics.  How can parties and people make suggestions &mdash; for example, that Africa has to pull itself up &mdash; when Zimbabwe, which used to provide food for the front line states under siege from Africa, sold its grain reserves and next year will need two million tonnes of grain for itself?  A Member of this House said that my visit to Somalia was a waste of time.  However, we are connected to what is happening in Africa and in the South of the world.  I had hoped that the dramatic events in recent times in Somalia would be sufficient to enable us to say that we must &ldquo;detoxify&rdquo;&mdash; as I call it &mdash; from this notion that we have a form of economics which is so right it must be imposed on the dead and the dying of Africa.</P>
    <P>Compassion is not enough, there must be a shift in our intellectual thinking, in <Col N="434" /> the way in which we look at the world.  I saw signals in the speech at the United Nations that we would accept interdependency for what it was; that means the revision of our economic thinking and it means changing our thinking in relation to debt, trade and aid.  There is a need for a new international economic order. President Robinson understands that. That sentiment is throughout her speech. The Brandt report suggested a new international economic order for self interest but there is now no suggestion of a new international economic order, even for self interest.  We need that so as to be able to save ourselves from the immiserization of our own economic thinking, because so many of those who have been most generous in giving have been people whom one could describe as the Somalia within Ireland.</P>
    <P>The same thinking of aggressive, acquisitive greed, the poison, has been spread in the world from the ideas of Van Haeck through to Friedman and popularised by Thatcher and Reagan, whom history will recall as the people who set the world into a regressive spiral back towards its appalling nadir of itself.  There are people sleeping under hotels in New York, Britain's economy is in bits and there are millions unemployed &mdash; all for a vicious ideology that people should serve the economy.  I call that ideology, the &ldquo;depeopled economy&rdquo;.  Maybe I thought when I was watching people die in Somalia that in this microcosm we would be able to take ourselves and save ourselves from the worst of ourselves and our most inhuman relationship of society and economics.  A good economic theory can be based on a relationship between north and south that is different.  To put that theory into practice requires an act of political will.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detail of the motion before the House, I should like to speak on one point that strikes me as interesting.  From being there, I thought that there could be some kind of a moral storm, as opposed to Desert Storm that became a byword of the Gulf War.  I was in Somalia for nine days and travelled in different places such as Mandera, where <Col N="435" /> Trócaire are trying to get 10,000 people out of a camp of 50,000 before the rains come &mdash; positively if the rains can assist the seed programme in Gido province, but negatively if the rains bring cholera &mdash; Bellahowa, where wells are being restored so as to enable people to have water; Garissa, where a bishop and a nun are trying to feed children; Mogadishu North, where the Red Cross are running a field hospital heroically and in co-operation with the Red Crescent; Baidoa, where Concern were the first in with food kitchens and in Mogadishu and outside of Baidoa, where volunteers have gone to work for GOAL.  I agree with the Minister and other spokespersons in paying tribute to those people.</P>
    <P>I noted that there were no television cameras around when I was in Somalia. I remember the competition between CNN, Sky and all the other stations as to who &ldquo;fired the first rocket&rdquo;.  In my house my children and myself were inundated with war video games by international news media companies.  The international news media were not present when I saw a child not make it to a clinic, nor were they in the field hospital of northern Mogadishu as I sat alongside a child of eight who was waiting to have his leg amputated.</P>
    <P>There is no point in suggesting that we can go on speaking about aid, about Africa and about the rest of the world, when we are in the grip of this mind of aggression that wants to be inundated with images of war and aggression.  The country that could rush to defend the El Salvadorians still has to deliver its 145,000 tonnes of promised food to Somalia. The Saudi Arabians, we are told, have so lessened their resources that they cannot help their neighbour.  There is an obscenity about all of this.  Of what I saw, to me the most moving was to stand watching the weapons left over by one Super-power and then another Superpower in the hands of children while other children a few feet away were walking skeletons. It was as if all morality had gone.  More important to me, the people who produce and sell weapons and glorify war are committing <Col N="436" /> crimes against this planet and crimes against humanity, by deflecting resources that are so urgently needed.  I remember thinking when I was in the Middle East before, that if only a fraction of the resources spent on weapons of destruction was spent on the provision of clean water there would be a tremendous impact on the population of the south.</P>
    <P>In relation to the events that have taken place in Somalia, there are important dimensions.  I think, for example, of those who are using the seeds programme; they are not only creating the capacity for reconstruction but are also creating a dialogue between and within clans.  One would have to go back to that system if trying to reconstruct civil society, because civil society has collapsed. The movements in peace that are coming from the ground up are as important and, perhaps, much more important than the talks that are taking place between President &mdash; as he calls himself &mdash; Mahdi and General Adid.  I met the chief of chiefs and the elders in Gido Province.  It is from a congress of these that will come a request to the main participants in the conflict to take themselves out of the scene.  One could then create a legitimacy which could be exercised.  The United Nations could then be asked to come in so that there may be a period of security when food can be distributed and the task of reconstructing society can be undertaken.</P>
    <P>For me, there were many revisions in my thinking.  I wished that Members of this House were willing to change their thinking, too.  For example, I have long valued sovereignty &mdash; remember my work in Central America &mdash; but there are now times when the issues are so great that we must think of other models in which we can attenuate that.  I believe that what has happened in Africa is more serious even that the later period of colonisation.  If the decolonisation committee of the United Nations came into existence for a specific purpose there are now specific purposes that ask us to establish agencies which would enable the United Nations to move more quickly.  Let us not criticise the <Col N="437" /> United Nations either as a concept or as an organisation.  As an organisation, it is something to which all the governments of the world belong.  If it is inoperable or made useless that is often because the permanent members of the Security Council want to make the United Nations weak.  Indeed, the inability of the United Nations to respond is a result of their actions.  One of the permanent members owes $730 million to the organisation. The United Nations' absence of reform was reflected in its bureaucracy and delayed its capacity to respond to issues such as the problems in Somalia.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of aid, it is not the transfer of resources that is so much involved in relation to the south such as the African countries about which we speak.  The issue is really one of equity. It is an issue of equity in trading and the need to be given a chance.  The global economy in 1989 was worth $20 trillion. The developing world debt stood at $1.3 trillion.  Its debt amounted to 44 per cent of the gross national product of that part of the planet.  We cannot speak meaningfully in terms of what we are going to do unless we speak about addressing these issues.  There is nothing abstract. President Robinson used the word &ldquo;shame&rdquo;, where the shame arises.  How long did it take to respond to Somalia? Sian Barre was gone in January 1991; why the long delay?  Let us think of another. Mozambique threatens to be worse than Somalia.  When will we respond to that? There is of course a need now, within days, for world leaders to make a response to the immediate problems of the Horn of Africa and to call a conference on the future of Africa.  Beyond all these immediate problems there are other and deeper ones threatening in that continent.  But here is the other one, which I am afraid I cannot make sense of &mdash; those who say they are interested in the aid argument and at the same time are clinging to the economics of death, who will not condemn the economics of armaments production.  If reference is made to Rio &mdash; I was covering the conference for the purpose of making a film in Rio &mdash; the Global Environmental <Col N="438" /> Facility is the main instrument in that strategy that was supposed to go forward from Rio; yet in the GEF, as it is called, the World Bank has a major role.  The World Bank and the IMF are forcing economic strategies on the countries that are short of food.</P>
    <P>How can you speak with any credibility about aid and responding to famine and death in Africa or anywhere else unless you are willing to take, as the President was, the grief of the existing structure of the world into yourself and decide that you will change it.  I do not make proposals that are not costed.  What I have proposed in our amendment would cost £20 million, but I believe there is public support for it.  That is why I offer it through a basis of consensus in this House rather than as a strictly party position.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of aid, it is important here not just to rehash the old record again about how there has been a failure in that regard.  It is dreadful that we have slid off from the way in which we were making progress, however slowly.  There are many other issues in relation to ODA that we should bear in mind.  As there will be a Government reply I want to be very specific about some points in the Minister's speech which I hope he will clarify because perhaps they are based on a misunderstanding.  In his speech he said:</P>
    <P>The European Community was among the first of the international donors to react but we must ask ourselves if there are not improvements that could be made in our procedures so that food and other vital supplies reach those areas where there is dire need.</P>
    <P>The European Community's political response to Somalia was a scandal.  It is probably of the order of its response, which I believe was intellectual paralysis, to the issue of unemployment in Europe itself.  It has failed abysmally in relation to unemployment; it has not even produced discussion papers that could be taken with respect.</P>
    <P>In relation to Africa and in the specific instance of Somalia it was, certainly <Col N="439" /> among the first, a scandalous and disgraceful response; its response in relation to the Horn of Africa and Africa in general is still awaited.  It is a great European shame.</P>
    <P>In regard to the world economy and the least developed countries in Africa there is a phrase in the Minister's speech &ldquo;falling further behind developed and developing countries alike.&rdquo; That paragraph gives the impression that we are all equal partners in a race.  We are not.  The debt that has been lent to the elites that have used 66 per cent of the receipts on military spending is an obstacle that has to be recognised.  The obstacles to trade have to be recognised.  The next paragraph refers to problems in Africa as a failure of economic growth.  How could you have economic growth when you have neither economic independence and when you are on a stranglehold from trade and debt?</P>
    <P>These are important points.  It will all have been wasted if there is not a change in thinking and we abandon this nonsense which is rather like blaming the unemployed for unemployment, the poor for poverty and Africa for Africa's tragedy.</P>
    <P>There is a need &mdash; and it would be as historic as the President's address &mdash; for agreement across all the parties that we would make the once off effort to get to the 1985-86 level and that after that we would agree to begin making progress along the lines I have suggested.  I have also suggested it is time for Irish representatives to speak out more forcefully at international fora in the Community in relation to issues of debt and trade.  It is important also that we begin to build the thinking of interdependency.  Is it not extraordinary that you can buy war games for your video but you cannot hear about peace, development or interdependency or planetary consciousness or aggression or the old challenges to what I have described in the school system.  Where is the space in our curriculum for building this new thinking?</P>
    <P>I have not described this evening much <Col N="440" /> of what I have seen.  I could have been prepared, as I have been, to see victims of torture in Central and Latin America and to see bodies that had been mutilated. But there was nothing that could have prepared me for what I saw and experienced during my time travelling within Somalia for nine days, which is a long time.  When I saw those people moving towards me and could determine in their eyes the stages of death towards which they were approaching.  I could feel there was a great dignity.  People have spoken much about this.  Another side of it was that those who were dying were going to be robbed of the capacity to grieve.  In Somalian society they grieve for three days and on the seventh day celebrate a person's life.  On the last day I spent in Somalia a mass grave was being created.  A bus was collecting bodies like bundles of sticks and putting them into graves at 20 a time; the week before it was at 100 a time to one hole.  The people will not know where their dead are buried.  They will have the great psychic loss of not having been able to grieve and there will have been the memory of the civil war.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the great trauma which Somalia has gone through and from which I hope it will recover &mdash; I pay tribute to all the aid workers and particularly those who are working in the act of reconstruction &mdash; will lead to such a rage against military spending and against this dreadful, poisonous economics that we will have an economics of interdependence and the building of the mind of peace.  From the Somalian man who put out his hand and said &ldquo;Welcome to the holocaust.  What is happening here is suicide&rdquo;, I never heard &ldquo;Ireland is only a small country&rdquo;.  I heard it in all the European debates here where we compared ourselves continually with the German economy, the French economy and the Italian economy.</P>
    <P>Smallness had nothing to do with it, it was the quality of one's moral actions and the quality of one's moral response. I knew they would never forget the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had <Col N="441" /> gone, that our President had gone, that others were going, that our aid agencies &mdash; the Red Cross, Trócaire, Concern and GOAL &mdash; were helping, etc.  It was not a matter of saying we are only a small country, an appendage to DM land; it is the fact that what we are doing is of quality.  It is this that must be built on.</P>
    <P>I hope we can get all party agreement on this amendment, take the benchmark of 1985 and build from there.  At the same time we should have development education in our schools and create a consciousness and generosity.  If this is done, not only will there be beneficiaries in the south of our planet but we will have grown both morally and intellectually and, in the process, will be able to construct a new version of most of the subjects we teach in our schools.</P>

      <P>Following the visit to Somalia by the previous speaker, all of us must know that an urgent and committed response to this problem is needed from the entire international community as well as from us.  We cannot know at this time how much the visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and President Robinson has achieved.  We hope that their deliberations will focus the attention of the rest of the western world on what is happening in Somalia so that something positive can be done.  The entire island of Ireland can be proud of what these people tried to do.  Every Irish person must say that at least we tried.  However, trying and talking are not enough; we must set about putting in place the measures which will prevent these problems continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somalia is a small country with a population of approximately five million.  A short time ago I met John O'Shea and other aid workers.  I was touched by the fierce anger which has grown in them <Col N="442" /> because of the lack of progress, the fact that no matter how hard they try they are not getting anywhere and the slowness of the rest of the world to respond to the problems in Somalia.  They are dreadfully angry at the military gangsters and gangs who operate in Somalia.  They outlined this point very clearly.  They spoke about very young people of ten and 14 years of age &mdash; I think they call themselves technicians &mdash; having guns.  Deputy Higgins spoke about seeing children carrying guns bigger than themselves &mdash; these children are probably well fed by African standards &mdash; standing hundreds of yards from children their own age but half their size.</P>
    <P>People say the first thing that has to be done is that a military presence has to be brought into Somalia.  I am anti-military in my political beliefs.  When I asked how a foreign army could be brought into another country, I was told to hell with that, we have got to get the food to the people.  Because the people are so poor, there are no rules and no one controls anything; the gun seems to be mightier than anything else in that country.  One can buy guns or bullets but one cannot get food.  Seemingly that is one of the first problems the international community will have to face up to.  One hears people asking, why do the people on the continent of Africa not do something about the problem; why do the Arabs not send more money, etc.?  That is only a copout.</P>
    <P>In her interview the other day President Robinson broke down while outlining the dreadful things she had seen in Somalia.  Both she and the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that when you are in the midst of the problem you almost become immune to it and it is not until you move away that you realise the dreadful things that are happening.  The Minister referred to it as a scandal: it is a horrific scandal.  Because of our history, particularly the famine, we must be acutely aware of these problems. However, the Irish famine, with all its grossness, was nothing like this famine where every system in the country seems <Col N="443" /> to have broken down.  Mogadishu is like a scene from a &ldquo;Mad Max&rdquo; film, with people running around and no organisation.</P>
    <P>The Somalis are lovely people.  A person who visited that country many years ago referred to them as the Irish of Africa because they are so open and friendly &mdash; which we like to think we are, and other races often say we are.  We are considering ways of helping these people. One day last week, 470 people died in Baidoa which has a population of, I think, 10,000.  We were all horrified a few days ago at the death of 230 people following a plane crash in Amsterdam. Rightly, this accident was covered by the newspapers and television, yet double that number of people die every day in a little place in Africa and it rarely receives any coverage.</P>
    <P>During the week people rang up &ldquo;Live-line&rdquo; to ask why the British and American press were not interested in what is happening in Somalia.  I do not know why.  It may be that the problems in Somalia have much to do with the Cold War struggle.  I think the Soviets gave them arms first; they gave them the hardware. When the two sides fell out, the USA gave them vast amounts of ammunition, tanks and armoured trucks.  The Irish Army count every shell they fire because they are so expensive.  The armaments used in Somalia are greater than we have ever seen.  Even if the entire Irish Army were sent to Somalia their equipment would not compare with the equipment used there.  The armaments trade has adopted a immoral attitude.  These major nations never once worried about the damage they would do to societies in these countries.</P>
    <P>I do not know a great deal about society in Somalia but I believe they are unique in that they are one tribe made up of different families.  People often say that Africans cannot pull together because of tribal differences.  For centuries the colonial powers did their best to ensure that the Africans fought one another and they created as much enmity as possible among them.  It is farcical, <Col N="444" /> immoral and wrong to say that no matter what is done Africa will be Africa.  We cannot allow Africa to continue as it is, we cannot stand back from it.  As a small country we have a moral influence much greater than our size and we must continue to use that in every way we can. From the Government's point of view, we have given an extra £0.5 million assistance to Somalia in addition to the £650,000 aid already provided.  There is extra aid coming from the EC, but Somalia needs such vast quantities of aid, I believe 60,000 tonnes of food a month, to keep their people fed.  How do we get that food to them?  The food cannot be transported by air transport.  It must be transported by ships and heavy road vehicles.  They are the only means of transport by which this country can receive food.  We must do everything in our power to try to facilitate the transportation of food to Somalia.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins stated that the UN said that we should not point the finger at the larger countries.  Some of the major powers have their own reasons for holding back.  Sometimes very large organisations are unwieldy in their operations.  I do not know if it would be possible, but Ireland by itself or through the EC should adopt a country like Somalia and make it part of our responsibility. We do great work in other neighbouring countries and it is urgently needed.  If we could concentrate on and organise aid for Somalia, a small country, we would be doing a great job for humanity and it would prove that, at least, there are some Europeans who are prepared to help their African neighbours.</P>
    <P>I understand the President during her visit to Somalia met some of the so-called warlords.  On seeing photographs and newsreel films of them they appear to be very well fed.  They said they would sit down and discuss a treaty or they might resign but, as we have seen in former Yugoslavia, words are very cheap, they can agree to anything but they do absolutely nothing.  Unless we force them into doing something about it we will continue to read and see these dreadful pictures on television day after day.  There is no <Col N="445" /> doubt that the distribution of aid particularly to the Baidoa region is very difficult. This was the area where most of the food was originally grown, but it was razed to the ground.  Each person who decided they were going to be the dictator of Somalia decided if they could not have what was there they would burn or destroy all that was in the place.  They made sure that their own people did not benefit from its resources.  They deprived their own people of the produce of the finest part of Somalia.  One cannot have food if there is no water.  One small well in any part of Somalia can keep 10,000 to 15,000 people alive.  How many wells would be necessary to keep the Somalis alive?  Very few.  How many people will die following this famine, because they are so deprived of any form of nourishment? How many families will be broken up never to come together again?  We in this country can supply a certain amount of money and expertise to Somalia, we provide aid to other parts of Africa, but now we have to concentrate on providing aid for Somalia.  We can pass on to the other nations in Europe what we learn from the famine in Somalia and how we handle the problems.  I am not a very religious person, but when one considers what is happening in Somalia, one must trust in God.</P>
    <P>I was horrified to see on American television a certain well known singer from this country deciding that the enemy was the man who is the head of my own religion.  We are all the enemy.  The enemy is certainly not the picture of the man she tore up.  That behaviour does not help anyone.  It would help if we put our own house in order, got together to do what the Minister, Deputy Andrews, did without any publicity. He was approached, he went off to Somalia to see the situation for himself and there were no cameras.  His gesture will help the people in Somalia greatly. His address to the United Nations will go down as one of the great addresses by any Irish politician.  This is how we should help Somalia; we should talk and try to prompt the wealthier nations of the world to do something.  Otherwise we will look <Col N="446" /> back and say what a disgrace, what a dreadful thing we have witnessed and allowed to happen.</P>

      <P>Is mór an trua é, ach glacaim leis an ordú.  In the few minutes available to me I want to mention also Ireland's bilateral aid programme generally. Recent programmes shown on television have demonstrated the extraordinary human misery at present being suffered in Somalia.  Our President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have achieved the task they undertook, which was to highlight for the entire world, particularly the nations of the developed world, the position obtaining there.  In my view they have succeeded in doing that.  We are grateful to them for having done so.  More importantly, the people of Somalia are thankful to them.</P>
      <P>It was an absolute disgrace and shame that responsible organisations such as the United Nations moved at such a snail's pace in responding to circumstances which developed in Somalia, not last month or the month before, but which had been fermenting over many years.  It was indeed dreadful to learn that bureaucracy had been the principal cause of lack of movement to address the dreadful circumstances developing in Somalia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my colleagues who spoke earlier has had wide experience of the Third World.  My experience of it has been limited to a visit to the city of Windhoek to address the SADCC Conference when I represented Ireland there in 1990. Deputy Michael Higgins claims that the phrase because we are a small nation, is a preamble to every statement on Third World Aid.  Because of the size of our economy, our contribution to the SADCC programme of action must necessarily be modest in comparison with those of larger, stronger economies.  Our <Col N="447" /> bilateral aid programme is governed by the philosophy of long term sustainability along with the development of local skills, objectives which formed an integral part of that SADCC Conference I attended.</P>
    <P>When I say that our bilateral aid programme concentrates mainly on countries in the SADCC region I should point out that that is primarily a technical assistance programme.  Under the bilateral aid programmes I was indeed pleased to witness Irish personnel pass on their skills to train people in Namibia, particularly in Lesotho, that little land-locked country one cannot enter or leave after 10 o'clock in the evening.  People there were being trained to cater for themselves by way of accountancy, technical training programmes and so on.  In the hills outside Maseru in Lesotho locals knit the equivalent of our Aran sweaters with, of course, a Cork man in charge. There is also the breeding of Connemara ponies, irrigation schemes and the building of roads.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a perception in the public mind &mdash; gained from many statements advocating an improvement in our monetary contribution to the bilateral aid programme &mdash; that monetary contributions constitute the most useful type of aid.  I should like to avail of this sad opportunity, in the case of Somalia &mdash; while remembering that we witnessed the same events in the Sudan, Ethiopia and Bangladesh &mdash; to emphasise that we here have many links with all of those areas.  It has been my experience that we play our part in helping the people of those countries to help themselves in the future.  Indeed, the value of our voluntary workers' contributions is acknowledged by everybody.  More important are the training, coaching and passing on of skills, including nursing skills, to the local people.  All of those activities are being catered for under our bilateral aid programme so that we can be justly proud of our contribution in that area.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that violence, from whatever quarter, will not serve the cause <Col N="448" /> of peace and reconciliation.  Indeed, it risks undermining the political process and puts in jeopardy some of the gains already made on that Continent.  It must have been an eye-opener to all of us to witness the volume and capacity of armaments displayed in the streets by youngsters, aged 12 upwards, the more powerful the weaponry the better being one's chance of survival in the circumstances obtaining in Somalia.  Is that the legacy the super-powers left behind in Somalia?  If it is, shame on them; shame on them for running off and allowing circumstances to develop which were to the detriment of the people of that country.</P>
    <P>My hope is that the generosity of our people will be sustained, as will the many tributes paid them by many developing countries, through our continuing support, distribution of talent and expertise in all areas where such is required.  I hope that as part of the EC we will encourage the formulation of structures, especially in Somalia where there are none at present, where there is no proper system of government.  This will entail a great deal of work and effort.  Indeed, it can well be said that our Department of Foreign Affairs, not just at present but throughout the years when our economy was not as powerful or as strong as others, played their part, <i>pro rata</i>, more than many wealthier economies worldwide.</P>
    <P>I hope that that great contribution on the part of our people will continue.  Molaim an méid atá déanta agus á dheanamh agus tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh ar an iarracht ón tír seo agus ó na Teachtaí agus ón Uachtarán a chuaigh go dtí Somalia le déanaí.</P>

      <P>My party have put down an amendment to the Fine Gael motion which we feel does not go far enough.  Obviously we support the principle which Fine Gael are proposing, i.e., that there be a phased increase in the Government's contribution to Overseas Development Aid.  We propose that the Dáil should note that we have never reached even half the United Nations <Col N="449" /> target and that Ireland rates the lowest of 18 OECD member states.  The amendment states that we believe that hunger and famine can only be defeated by substantial increases in the level of transfers of money, resources and expertise from the developed to the less developed world.  It urges all parties in the Dáil to agree on a phased equal increase in ODA so that the UN target is reached within five years.  We further call for this to be enshrined in legislation so that any future Government would find it difficult to renege on such a commitment.  Further noting the current appalling crisis in Somalia, we welcome the courageous decision of President Robinson to visit Somalia in order to focus attention on the need for urgent international action to combat famine there.  We commend the prompt reaction of voluntary organisations and the generosity of many ordinary citizens in responding to the crisis and we call on the Government to match pound for pound money raised in this way for Somalia.</P>
      <P>The harrowing photographs and graphic television film we have seen of the plight of the people of Somalia in recent weeks has brought home to us all the ugly reality of human existence in much of the Third World where permanent hunger is a fact of life and death is often a welcome release.  The poignant scenes of emaciated and starving people &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; which so moved President Robinson puts our own economic and social problems in a different perspective.  What we have all seen on our television screens in the comfort of our own homes must remind us that by the standards of the unfortunate people of Somalia we are very well off and that we, therefore, have a moral and political responsibility to respond to their plight and to offer what assistance we can.  Our eyes have been opened to what President Robinson described as &ldquo;the greatest tragedy facing the world today&rdquo;: we must now respond by opening our hearts and our pockets to those who are suffering in Somalia and other parts of the developing world.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> I welcome the fact that the first Private Members' Business of the new Dáil session has been devoted to Overseas Development Aid.  It is, I hope, a sign of the new priority which all parties in this House will now devote to the topic. However, I consider that the Fine Gael motion is rather weak; that the timetable for the achievement of the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP is too long and I am disappointed that it does not deal with the particularly urgent need for emergency measures to deal with the Somalian tragedy.</P>
    <P>The proposal in our amendment for a five-year timetable is a more appropriate target, especially in view of the fact that successive Governments have, in the past, pledged to meet it and then broken the promises.  I believe that our suggestion that it should be written into legislation to make it more difficult for any future Government to renege on the commitment is a reasonable one, and I believe that there would be widespread support for our proposal that the Government should respond to the particular urgency of the situation in Somalia by matching, pound for pound, the money raised by voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>As we approach the end of the 20th century, one in every five people on this planet &mdash; 1,000 million &mdash; continues to live in absolute poverty and one million children under the age of five years die every month in the developing world from famine, under-nutrition and preventable diseases.</P>
    <P>In Africa alone 30 million people face the threat of starvation.  Latin America has suffered an unprecedented cholera epidemic due to lack of basic hygiene, health and sanitary facilities.  Large scale flooding in Bangladesh and other coastal regions of Asia occurs with increasing regularity due to environmental destruction and lack of basic infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Developing countries are crippled by international debt which prevents investment in vital areas such as health and education.  Tackling issues such as illiteracy and AIDS prevention is made almost impossible in many cases.  The <Col N="451" /> latest figures show that in the 95 poorest countries 25 per cent more was spent on servicing international debt than on education and health services combined.</P>
    <P>Throughout the developing world scarce resources are being wasted on ethnic and regional conflicts with arms supplied from the rich &ldquo;North&rdquo;, while undemocratic regimes enslave and exploit their populations, often with the blessing of the developed world.  More than 40 years after the enactment of the UN Declaration on Human Rights and two centuries after the French Revolution, the idea that &ldquo;all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights&rdquo; remains more an aspiration than a statement of fact.</P>
    <P>The past five years have, however, seen an unprecedented change in international relations.  The Cold War has ended and military spending has stopped rising in most developed countries, but unfortunately not in all.  Proxy wars fought out between opposing military super powers in the developing world are drawing to a close.  There is an increasing will for democratic change among the people of the developing countries.</P>
    <P>The countries of the &ldquo;rich&rdquo; world must grasp this opportunity to increase funding and assistance to the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America.</P>
    <P>The greatest challenge facing humanity as we approach the 21st century is to devise a plan and campaign for a new international economic order.  This does not imply neglect of poverty and injustice in Ireland or the EC.  On the contrary, the struggle for social justice at home is identical with that in the world as a whole.</P>
    <P>This debate is taking place on the day on which the President is reporting to the Secretary General of the United Nations on the outcome of her trip.  The people of this country have been quite rightly proud of the courage shown by President Robinson in wanting to visit Somalia and <Col N="452" /> her genuine compassion for those enduring such suffering there.</P>
    <P>While high profile visits like this can play a major role in highlighting the suffering, and mobilising international emergency, the President would be the first to admit they cannot solve the problem. The sort of suffering now being experienced by the people of Somalia can be found in many other parts of Africa and Asia &mdash; albeit in less severe form. Hunger and famine can only be defeated by substantial increases in the levels of transfers of money, resources and expertise from the developed to the less developed world.</P>
    <P>The record of success of Irish Governments in relation to ODA is dismal.  We have never reached even half the United Nations target and our Overseas Development Aid expressed as a percentage of GNP is now at the same level as in 1980.  We have the poorest record of any of the 18 members of the OECD. We give the equivalent of 2.5p per person per day in official aid.  The Minister tried to compare our contribution with that of the United States, whose ODA is 0.19 per cent of their GNP.  In gross terms that would be many hundreds of millions more than we contribute but it is a bit unfair, given that the United States have to carry the burden of fighting wars in the Gulf and maintaining arms supplies to dictatorships around the world.  They are really making a very good contribution in protecting the world from whatever it perceives to be the enemy, now that communism is dead.</P>

      <P>I am speaking with tongue in cheek.  The way they spend money on arms is a disgrace and they have no compunction in supplying arms to states and regimes which oppress their people and keep them in poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely now would be an appropriate time for the Government to respond to <Col N="453" /> the magnificent gesture of the President by a bold initiative on ODA?  I would urge the Minister to invite the Opposition parties in the Dáil to enter into discussions with a view to agreeing a timetable to bring our ODA up to the United Nations target within five years.  The President's initiative should mark the beginning of a new and more generous era in State aid to the Third World.  We should be justifiably proud of the magnificent response of the Irish people and especially the voluntary agencies, but this should not be used as a reason to justify a parsimonious approach by the Government.</P>
    <P>President Robinson, speaking on US television this morning, called for a tidal wave of justice for Somalia.  We are a relatively small country and if we cannot provide a tidal wave let us at least initiate a substantial ripple.  If other countries do likewise perhaps it will turn into a tidal wave.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the flow of money and resources between Ireland and the Third World is not one way traffic. Indeed, Deputy Michael Higgins has already pointed out the substantial transfer of resources from the Third World to the developed world.  That is also true in relation to Ireland.  Despite the level of deprivation in the Third World, Ireland is a net beneficiary from its contacts with the developing countries.  In 1987, for example, earnings by Irish semi-State companies from consultancy and technical assistance contracts with developing countries reached a total of £86 million and have remained at a similar level since then.  Ireland is therefore earning at least twice what it provides in official development aid, and this does not include the earnings of private companies.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are quick to demand assistance from the wealthier countries in the European Community.  European Structural Funds, at around £600 million per year, equal about 2.6 per cent of Ireland's GNP.  That is more than 16 times our percentage ODA contribution. <Col N="454" /> It is unacceptable for the Irish Government to demand that the wealthier EC states provide greater support for the poor of the Community while at the same time we restrict the aid we provide to the poorest countries in the world.  Indeed, it is time the European Community adopted a more open and beneficial approach to the Third World.</P>
    <P>Central to a more enlightened EC approach to the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America is provision of greater access to developing countries' produce in western markets, fundamental improvement in terms of trade for the less developed countries and cancellation or rescheduling of their debt.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by drawing attention to a submission which Trocaire made to Government on Ireland's development co-operation policy.  It is a very well produced document and includes a range of recommendations to Government, every one of which I support wholeheartedly.  Anyone who has an interest in this area should read this report.  It includes recommendations on development co-operation policy, the role of NGOs, the general issues of overseas development aid, co-financing and disaster relief, developments in education, trade and debt.  There are a range of organisations in the NGO area who do great work in developing countries, but Trocaire, which is a specifically Roman Catholic development agency, are doing an excellent job in helping to educate the public, and young people in particular, about the issues involved in development aid.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he stated on television last night that the greatest single problem for Somalia is the fact that it does not have any oil resources.  If it had oil resources 500,000 US troops would be mobilised on its borders ready to help, but unfortunately, for the people of Somalia it has no oil resources.</P>

      <P>One of the problems <Col N="455" /> of the Fine Gael side is that so many people wish to speak in the short time available that we must divide our time. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues, Deputies Enright and Kenny be allowed to share my time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy De Rossa's final point, if Africa had oil resources much more aid would have been ploughed into the area.</P>
      <P>As a nation we suffered the deprivations of famine where millions of our people died.  For that reason alone we should take a lead in helping the people of Somalia.  We should be to the forefront in putting forward our views and encouraging those people.  We should use our moral authority to persuade other nations to contribute towards alleviating the famine in Somalia.  It is with considerable regret that this House has allowed itself to be used as an instrument of reducing aid to the Third World, from .62 per cent in 1986 to .17 per cent in 1992.  Last year alone there was a drop of £2.6 million compared to 1991.  Our President has to a large extent redeemed us by visiting Africa and trying to highlight the position at first hand.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Michael Higgins have also visited Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited Africa some years ago and at that time the position was extremely bad, but it has deteriorated even further since then.  I came away with a number of lasting memories from my visit to Tanzania. I was shocked and horrified at the way people were living there.  I was appalled and upset by it.  However, as an Irishman I was proud of the efforts of our people working in Tanzania.  Their contribution and generosity restored not alone my pride in young people, but my belief in human nature.  That fine work was being carried out by Irish people of <Col N="456" /> all religious persuasions and by people from many different countries.</P>
    <P>To some extent our moral authority has declined because we have reduced our level of support.  However, even at this late stage we should reassert our authority and use our influence, as a small nation which suffered famine in the past, on the other bigger nations.  Let us hope that a great deal of the money which is being spent on armaments will be channelled in the direction of keeping people alive.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government should match pound for pound every pound given by people to voluntary organisations.  That should be our goal.</P>

      <P>The Government's response to the motion in the name of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is far removed from the stench of gangrene and decaying limbs, the listless look in the eyes of millions of children and the sweet sickly smell of impending death in refugee camps across the continent of Africa.  At a time when the first citizen of this land, a native of my county, in a move reminiscent of Pope John Paul II's gesture to the men of violence, when he appealed on his knees for an end to violence, appealed on her knees to the developed world to come to the assistance of millions of poor families impoverished by greed and war, the Government's response to the Fine Gael motion is so bland and removed from reality.  Mr. Cecil W. Smith said that The Great Hunger had created a tradition, a feeling and an instinct in Irish people throughout the world to help those who are less fortunate than themselves.  That instinct is very strong in our people today.  We can take pride in the committed efforts of volunteers who have given up their quality of life here to work with unfortunate people in Third World countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fighting has broken out again in Liberia.  The SMA Fathers from Cork have a programme of work there for a number of years.  They need £6,000 to set <Col N="457" /> up a printing press and have undertaken to do all the printing necessary to educate the primary school children in the capital of Monrovia and indeed throughout Liberia.  They have been turned down by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I hope the Department will reconsider their application.  Throughout the length and breadth of the country the SMA Fathers have collected unwanted goods and equipment and shipped it to Monrovia. They aim to take guns from the hands of children by encouraging them back into schools and giving them a basic education.  They have the printing press but not the facilities to run it.  They have made a formal appeal to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I hope that for the sake of the £6,000 required this beneficial educational facility will not be lost.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is probably aware of this.</P>

      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate.  I had hoped for a positive commitment from the Government.  I am utterly disappointed and dejected at the bland reaction of the Government to a very serious motion at a very important time in our history.  The motion seeks a recommitment to the UN target of 0.7 per cent, and a commitment to a financial framework to achieve that within seven years.  Deputy De Rossa suggested five years.  I would accept five years, if everybody would agree to it, but I suggested seven years because I hoped <Col N="458" /> to induce the Government to agree to that timeframe.  All we have got are bland banal phrases from the Government but no commitment.  That is why I am utterly dejected and frustrated.</P>
      <P>Do the Government realise the consequence of their rejection?  I am not pointing the finger at the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.  I watched him as he laboured through his script.  I know he would have liked to agree to my motion, but his Government will not let him.  I am certainly not pointing the finger at his Minister, Deputy Andrews, who has said and done the right things and whose heart is in the right place, but even he cannot get his hard-hearted stoney-faced Goverment to agree to discharge our obligations to reach the UN target.  I am afraid that as members of that Government, they have to share the responsibility. It is not for me to say what will be the consequences of our failure to produce the moneys that we are morally committed to produce, or how many people will die as a consequence, or how many projects will not go ahead as a consequence.  I will leave that to the Members on the Government side to deal with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stafford spoke from the heart about the problems of Somalia and elsewhere in Africa.  I accept every word he said but yet he concluded by saying, &ldquo;we must talk and talk and prompt action from wealthier nations&rdquo;.  How can we expect a response from other nations, when we are not prepared to respond?</P>

      <P>How can we ask other people to put their hands in their pockets when we are not prepared to put our hands in our pockets?  I can get cross about this issue and, perhaps, it is because I come from Skibbereen.  The people of Skibbereen are known as the &ldquo;donkey eaters&rdquo; because in the last century the town of Skibbereen suffered more than any other part of the country <Col N="459" /> from the Famine.  It is still a folk memory there.  Outside the town we still have the famine graves in the Abbey.  In the last century in Ireland we had black '47.  In the last decade we had Ethiopia and this year we have Somalia.  Next year we will have Mozambique</P>
      <P>The Skibbereen of the last century is the Baidoa of today.  With that memory of a time when there was plenty of food to feed our people, do we stand back and refuse to put our hands in our pockets? That is what the Government are doing and that is why I feel so utterly dejected and depressed at their response to this motion which was not introduced for political reasons.  It was introduced in the hope that it could get the parties in this House to agree to its terms or something similar.  We are giving the back of the hand tonight to the people who are starving and dying in Africa.  That pains and hurts me.  We share the guilt and the responsibility in doing that.  The Scrooge like attitude of the Government is contributing to what is happening in Africa today.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday I attended a harvest thanksgiving celebration.  One of the hymns sung that night &mdash; and it is appropriate here &mdash; was as follows: In the just reward of labour, God's will is done/In the help we give our neighbour, God's will is done/In our worldwide task of caring for the hungry and despairing, /In the harvest we are sharing, God's will is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find in our papers today, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday?  A whole nation has been destroyed.  What is our reaction?  Look at the tables in the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i> We find that contributions <Col N="460" /> in official aid are as follows: Australia £955 million, Belgium £889 million, Denmark over £1,000 million, Norway £1,200 million and Sweden over £2,000 million.  What is our contribution? It is £57 million.  We are less than a third of the way towards our commitment to the UN target.</P>
    <P>Yet again on Monday we hear that the Government will put pressure on the EC for aid.  Have we not got a brass neck asking anybody to give aid to Africa when we are not willing to pay our share, when we are not willing to pay our dues on foot of a commitment that we freely and voluntarily entered into over 20 years ago?</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the Government of which I was a part in the eighties can be fully absolved from blame, but at least we made an effort.  When I took over responsibility for overseas aid in 1981 the level of aid was .18 per cent.  Painfully slowly and tediously, with support from the Labour Party, we pushed it up until in 1986 it reached .26 per cent.  If we had continued that rate of progression we would now be over half way towards the UN target.  Instead we are away back to .17 per cent.</P>
    <P>We should be ashamed of this record. Every one of us is responsible unless we keep pushing day in, day out, until we recommit ourselves to the UN target, until we put our hands in our pockets and give in official aid what is needed, what the starving of the Third World deserve and what we as a country with our history should do as a very minimum.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to have this opportunity to raise this matter in the House this evening.  It concerns a basic human right.  The issue involved is a very simple one and I hope we can get some answers in the House this evening in relation to it.  It is strictly the responsibility of the Department of Justice.  I hope that the Minister of State at that Department can give some explanations tonight as to the attitude and the policy implemented by the Department.  As I understand it, we have always provided opportunities for foreign doctors to complete their education and their studies in this country.  This is a commendable policy which I fully support.  The matter I am raising this evening concerns the refusal by the Department of Justice to issue visas to the wives and children of those doctors who wish to live with their spouses in Ireland for the period of their study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand the attitude <Col N="464" /> being taken in this matter by the Department of Justice.  Why are the Department of Justice refusing to facilitate these applicants from various countries in their applications to come to this country on very reasonable grounds, to join their spouses and establish their families here? I would like an explanation from the Minister of this matter.  I would also like him to focus on the attitude taken by the relevant section in the Department of Justice, a section which does not appear to be answerable to anybody except the Minister.  When Deputies try to contact that section directly our queries are redirected to the Minister's office.  I wonder whether that section of the Department is answerable.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why there is a refusal to allow Deputies to query officials of that section of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>It is particularly difficult to understand the attitude of the Department of Justice in this matter because we in this House are not slow to criticise the agencies of other countries when our citizens experience difficulty in obtaining work permits or indeed visitor's visas.  This matter has been raised in this House and outside it in the last number of months.  If there is to be consistency we will have to establish that our agencies and Departments treat people with respect and dignity and do not refuse applications <i>per se</i>, as has been the case in the last number of months.</P>
    <P>Basically what I am asking is that these people have the same rights to visit their spouses who are working and studying in this country as we would seek for our citizens who wish to travel abroad and live in other countries.  I am concerned about this matter.  I would ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to give an explanation of justification for the refusal of the applications, details of which I supplied.  It is totally undesirable and, as a public representative, I believe that nobody in the Department can stand over it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Spring's obvious deep concern in the matter.  The particulars supplied by the Deputy about these eight cases are not sufficiently specific or detailed in each instance to enable it to be established, in the short time available since notice was received of this matter being raised on the Adjournment, whether applications for entry visas were received from the spouses of each of the individuals concerned and, if so, what the position is with regard to all the applications.  If Deputy Spring says that the applications have been sent in, I am prepared to accept that.  However, I can inform him that in one of the eight cases a visa application was received from the spouse of the individual concerned and the application was granted in September of this year, while in another case an application from the spouse was received and refused.  I will endeavour to have the position in relation to the remaining cases established as soon as possible and I will communicate further with the Deputy in the matter.</P>
      <P>The approach taken in relation to these visa applications would have been the same as that taken in relation to all such applications.  Each visa application is considered on an individual basis in the light of the information submitted in support of the application and each application is decided on its own merits.  It has never been the practice to disclose the reasons for a refusal to grant a visa.  This is common practice internationally in relation to this matter and it is not proposed to depart from that practice on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, from whose constituency the father of the man in qustion hails.  The father, Martin Gary Padgett, is an Irish citizen living in Ontario in Canada.  He hails originally from Mooncoin and his forebearers come from Clogga, County Kilkenny.  Mr Padgett assumed Irish citizenship based on his lineage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to proceed on that basis.  The father of the adopted child is an Irish citizen by lineage.  He has lived his life in Canada where he works in an organisation known as United Way/Centraide, a charitable organisation which supports AIDS victims.  He has been active on a voluntary basis helping south east Asian nationals settle in Canada and it was in the context of that <Col N="467" /> work that he adopted a young man, born in 1967, as his son under Canadian law.</P>
      <P>I first became aware of this case when dealing in 1991 with the Foreign Adoptions Bill.  Every effort was made by those of us on the Special Committee to see whether this gentleman and his son could be accommodated under that legislation. That was not possible but nonetheless we had great confidence that the position would be resolved on the basis of an application for naturalisation of citizenship. As the father so graphically put it, what he wants to do as an Irish citizen is pass on his citizenship to his son.  In furtherance of that desire, having visited Ireland and met with the Department officials in March 1991, he submitted a very detailed application for naturalisation of citizenship.  He asked the Minister to exercise his discretion under section 5 of the Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, and in July of last year I wrote to the Minister in support of that application.  I regret that the Minister initially did not see his way to agreeing to the application.  I am asking the Minister of State this evening to have the case re-investigated to see if the Minister can exercise his discretion in favour of this application.</P>

I do not wish to pre-empt what the Minister has to say but I would just add my voice in the hope that the matter will be re-investigated and discretion used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will also be very brief.  I support fully the case put professionally by Deputy McCartan.  We attempted to amend the Foreign Adoptions Bill to facilitate this child because the circumstances were unusual and certainly merited our support.  Unfortunately, the matter was outside the terms of the Bill, <Col N="468" /> particularly regarding the age of the child.  At that time this country was supportive of Vietnamese refugees and extended hospitality to them.  I felt, as did Deputy McCartan, that this was a special case because of the history of these people who had to leave their homeland.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, who responded positively to this matter during discussion on the legislation but said it was outside the terms of the legislation, to consider the possibility of citizenship, particularly through the naturalisation process.  It is not unusual to do that.  This man is Irish and he wants his son to be Irish.  He deserves that break and I have no doubt that the Minister, who has many ideas about what he wants to do in his Department, could facilitate us in this very special case in which so many Deputies have been involved directly with the father of the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986, set out certain conditions to be complied with by applicants for naturalisation. These conditions include such requirements as that the applicant should have a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of his application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years and that he intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Justice is satisfied that an applicant complies with the statutory conditions he may, in his absolute discretion, grant the application.  The Minister also has discretion to waive any or all of the statutory conditions for naturalistion in certain prescribed circumstances, including where an applicant is of Irish descent or has Irish associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applicant in the case referred to by the Deputy is a 25 year old Vietnamese who was resident in Canada since 1985 <Col N="469" /> and became a naturalised Canadian citizen in February 1990.  He was subsequently adopted in Canada by a person who is a Canadian citizen, resident in Canada, and who is also an Irish citizen by descent and was registered in the foreign births register in February 1990.</P>
    <P>An application for naturalisation on behalf of the person referred to by the Deputy was considered by the Minister and refused.  He is satisfied that the decision he made in this case was the correct one.  It has been the policy of successive Ministers for Justice not to disclose the reasons for decisions taken in particular cases in regard to applications for naturalisation.  This practice has been upheld by the High Court and he does not proposed to depart from it in this instance.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the interest in the case by Deputies McCartan, Ferris and Coughlan and the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, who has made many representations in regard to this matter, I propose to have the case re-examined by my Department.  I will communicate directly with the Deputies when the examination has concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter yet again on the Adjournment.  We must be making history in the House because this is the fourth occasion that the matter of the community school in Cashel has been raised on an Adjournment debate. Nevertheless, in spite of all those efforts, despite numerous parliamentary questions, letters, requests and deputations to the Minister, there has been no sign of the community school materialising in Cashel.  At this stage the people are really frustrated by the fact that, over the last number of years, they have been fobbed <Col N="470" /> off with broken promises and commitments which have not been honoured.</P>
      <P>I have a file of letters from the Department over the past three years and every single letter contained good news, &ldquo;that the school was starting soon&rdquo;, &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; and &ldquo;progress is reported&rdquo;. However, to date, little or no progress has been made.  The action committee for the school want to know what happened to the £600,000 which they were told had been allocated in this year's budget for the school.  They also want to know why the school did not commence in September, as promised.  They are not prepared to accept responses that the school will be built without delay.  They want to know when the tender will be placed and when they can expect builders on the site in Cashel.  Furthermore, they want to know whether the money has been allocated in the Department for this project.  If not, where has the £600,000 been spent in the meantime?</P>
      <P>The people in Cashel have been very patient.  They have been told many times that the building of the school will start in three months but there is always a further delay.  Over the last few weeks it has been embarrassing and frustrating to contact the Department of Education because I have been given excuses for the school not being built, ranging from the project being so vast that it has to be thoroughly examined, to having to wait for a fire certificate clearance from the local authority.  Why has there not been an application from the Department of Education for a fire clearance certificate? We will not accept that the need for such a certificate can in any way delay commencement of the school in Cashel.  We want to hear the truth, we can cope with that, but we cannot cope with broken promises or with commitments which will not be honoured.  The anger and frustration of people is so great at this stage that they intend to resort to the national media to try to highlight their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saga of Cashel community school has been going on since 1979 and progress <Col N="471" /> was supposed to have been made.  During all those years the people of Cashel cooperated and waited patiently.  We want a direct answer to a direct question.  When will the school in Cashel start?  We do not want to hear &ldquo;soon&rdquo;, &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; or &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  When can we expect to see the builders on the site in Cashel?  We also want to know whether the money has been allocated for this project.</P>
    <P>Every time I left the Dáil Chamber having raised this issue on an Adjournment debate I was happy because I had been given a commitment that the building of the school was about to start. However, I will not be satisfied tonight unless I get a clear and definite commitment from the Minister in relation to the date on which building will start and whether money has been allocated for the project.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment as it allows me to outline the up-to-date position.  I have made representations over the years in relation to this project.</P>
      <P>By way of background, the Deputy will be aware of some delays due to the fact that this project was one of those included in a pilot scheme for the procurement of school buildings on a design/finance and build basis.  Unfortunately, due to various difficulties, including legal ones, this approach had to be abandoned and the project proceeded in the Department's conventional planning procedure.</P>
      <P>The school is a major undertaking, involving the provision of accommodation for 800 pupils in almost 5,000 m² of accommodation.  Currently the Department are examining the tenders submitted for the project and it has also been necessary to apply for a fire safety certificate under the new building regulations which have only recently come into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> Deputies will be very pleased to learn that only recently a commitment was given to proceed to construction with the Cashel project as soon as the final tender details have been worked out and the fire safety requirements have been complied with.</P>
    <P>I am sure that this news will be of great interest to the Deputy and the locality. Deputy Davern and Senator McCarthy have also been involved in this project for many years.</P>

      <P>The issue I wish to raise is special in every way.  It concerns a special school in my constituency which caters for 184 or 187 mildly mentally <Col N="473" /> handicapped boys and girls.  It is special in the sense that its work is valued by the parents of the area and it is special in that its catchment area is a disadvantaged area or, in the language of the Department, a deprived area.  Despite these circumstances, the board of management have found it necessary to appeal to the Minister to have them considered under the facility in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to appoint a secretarial assistant.  Because of the special dimensions of the school and the complexity of the administration, there is a need for that facility in a school doing much needed and valuable work. Although the school does not specifically meet the pupil number requirement, I hope the Minister will consider this request.  Special schools feel that they are marginalised and that their work is not appreciated.  I can vouch for the good work being done by this school and I ask the Minister to reconsider the application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is aware that the first phase of a programme was introduced in September 1992.  This programme was provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to expand the provision for caretaking and clerical services to all national schools with 100 pupils upwards and to all second level schools with 200 pupils upwards.  For this purpose, in the case of national schools not being provided with such services under any existing arrangements, an additional grant not exceeding £15,000 will be paid to schools of 500 pupils upwards, with a <i>pro rata</i> provision related to school size in the range 100 to 499.  For secondary schools, the maximum increase in capitation grant will amount to £17,000 for schools of 350 pupils upwards, with a <i>pro rata</i> provision in the range of 200 to 349.  These arrangements are complemented by the provisions under the social employment scheme.  Schools with 500 pupils and over which do not currently have secretarial <Col N="474" /> services are being assisted in the first phase of the programme.</P>
      <P>Grants are a supplement to the schools capitation grant and boards of management are responsible for making the necessary arrangements for the provision of clerical and caretaking services appropriate to the needs of the school.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that assistance to those schools should have been given top priority.  As resources become available, the needs of other schools will be addressed.  My Department are at present defining priorities for the further phasing in of the programme.  In this regard, particular account will be taken of the needs of special schools.  I assure the Deputy that his concern regarding this special school will be noted.</P>

      <P>Because my contribution is limited to two minutes, I can deal with the core of this problem only. I speak of the problem relating to the community school at Portumna in County Galway.</P>
      <P>Amalgamation of the existing secondary school and the nearby vocational school was mooted by the Department of Education in 1989 and in 1990 it became a reality.  The amalgamation took place rapidly because the teachers, parents and boards of management involved took the Department at their word that a full, comprehensive range of subjects would be made available at once.  That did not happen and now Portumna is the only community school in Ireland that does not offer metalwork or engineering as a subject choice.</P>
      <P>The college authorities want to meet the Minister for Education urgently.  So far their requests have received no positive response.  I should like the Minister of State to say that the Minister will meet them, or give the reasons for not meeting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to deliver on the promise made by the Department to the new community school in 1989, a new building extension is absolutely necessary.  Planning <Col N="475" /> permission has been received and the plans are ready.  This evening I want the Minister to guarantee the pupils, the teachers and the parents of the 620 pupil school in Portumna that he will include the cost of the building in the 1993 Estimate currently being prepared.  If that does not happen, I issue a very stern warning to all other schools countrywide contemplating amalgamation.  The Portumna experience is beginning to turn very sour and the Department must honour their financial commitment now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to tell the House about the situation in Portumna community school.</P>
      <P>Following agreement at local level between the two post-primary schools in the town, Portumna community school came into operation on 1 August 1990. The enrolment in the school year ended last June was 632 pupils.  The school operates in the main from Portumna college, which has good accommodation and which had received substantial grants over the years.  It was decided to develop the community school on that site.  The vocational school, while continuing to be used, is in bad condition and needs to be replaced.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, my Department have approved the provision of new accommodation providing an extra 872 square metres along with the adaptation of some of the existing accommodation. The schedule of new accommodation is as follows: four general classrooms, one science laboratory and prep-resource area, one senior metal work room and store, one woodwork-building construction room and store, one home economics room, one group room and store, pastoral offices, toilets and cloakroom, social-circulation assembly room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project is now at an advanced stage of planning, with a view to proceeding to tender as soon as possible. However, having regard to the extremely difficult financial situation, it is not possible <Col N="476" /> at this stage to be specific as to when the project will be released to tender and construction.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister for Education and myself have had several meetings and discussions regarding this project with our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, who has played a key role in educational developments in the Portumna area over the past number of years.  I assure the House that full consideration will be given to the needs of Portumna community school when the departmental allocations for 1993 are being finalised.</P>

      <P>Gavin Rose is a four and a half year old child in Malahide.  He is deaf, he has cerebral palsy and this year he was accepted as a pupil for the first time, because of his age, in St. Joseph's School for the Deaf in Navan Road, Dublin.  As such, Gavin is entitled to free school transport to this school.  On the day of school opening or thereabouts Gavin's parents were informed that he could use school transport but he would be collected as early as 7.30 a.m. for a school start at 9.30 a.m.  He would have to sit on a school bus for two hours on his way to school and two hours on his way home.</P>
      <P>Gavin not only has a multiple handicap but he has only been toilet trained recently.  This may not seem an important issue for a young child of Gavin's age, but to ask a child with such handicaps to sit on a school bus for two hours in the morning and in the afternoon and to spend a day at school is inhumane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Gavin returns home from school each day his parents have to go through a regime of exercises with him because of his cerebral palsy.  Gavin's mother recently came out of hospital after a major operation.  If she were to take up the school transport offer she would have to rise at 6.30 a.m. to get Gavin his breakfast, get him dressed and into his wheelchair to take him to the school bus.  In the school bus Gavin would have to sit in <Col N="477" /> a specially designed, strapped-in chair or seat.</P>
    <P>That system is not humane and I ask the Minister tonight to give me a commitment that he will examine the present system for handicapped children.  Gavin is not the only child in this country having to live with that kind of system.  I ask the Minister to arrange for a taxi to call to Gavin's home, and to the homes of one or two other children in his neighbourhood, so that the travel time to and from school can be reduced to a realistic 30 to 40 minutes each way.  The Department told me they are willing to reduce the time in the morning but not in the afternoon.  That is not good enough.  That is not humane.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the very genuine case raised by the Deputy and my Department have been investigating this matter for some time.  The position is that the original transport arrangement proposed for the boy in question would have involved an extension to an existing service in the area at increased cost to my Department.  Under that arrangement the boy would have been collected by school bus at his home at 7.30 a.m. and he would have arrived home in the evening at 5.00 p.m.  Due to the fact that he was first on and last off each day the boy was spending a considerable time on the bus.  The difficulty in resolving the situation was that, having regard to the locations covered by the particular service, it was not possible to improve on timetable for that service.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, Bus Éireann, who are my Department's agents for the provision of school transport services, were asked to investigate the matter further as a matter of urgency.  The particular difficulties which the pupil has, and the demands imposed by the original timetable, were emphasised by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A revised arrangement is now proposed by Bus Éireann whereby the boy will be collected at 8.25 a.m. in the morning and arrive at school at 9.40 a.m.  He <Col N="478" /> will be collected on the same service at 2 p.m. and will arrive at home at 4.15 p.m.  I am satisfied that this revised arrangement is a significant improvement and the relevant parties are being informed.  However, because of the very genuine situation that exists here I will endeavour if possible to improve on that service.</P>

It is very important in a general sense, taking into account that we have such a large number of soldiers in the Lebanon on a regular basis.  I should like to know what steps can be taken to minimise the risks to the best degree.  I should like to know from the Minister what diplomatic or political steps can be taken in support of our <Col N="479" /> peacekeepers.  Lastly, I want to say that I was somewhat worried, following the killing of Corporal Ward, to find a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, 6 October in which it was stated that four Irish UN posts were again hit by heavy machinegun fire from the Israeli backed South Lebanese Army a week or so later. Obviously there is continuing danger there and I want to know from the Minister what he is doing about it.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House will wish to join with me in expressing deepest sympathy to the family and friends of the late Corporal Peter Ward &mdash; I appreciate the condolences which Deputy O'Keeffe has already expressed &mdash; on their great loss and in paying tribute to the supreme sacrifice made by him in the cause of peace in the Lebanon.  Our thoughts are also with the family of Private Niall Coleman who was injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident which resulted in Corporal Ward's death occurred after a series of attacks early on Tuesday, 29 September 1992 by armed elements on positions held by Israeli backed militia. Following the attacks two armed men driving a car were refused passage through an Irish UN checkpoint at A1 Journ &mdash; part of the UN mandate.  More armed elements arrived, approximately 25 to 30 armed men, and a standoff developed between them and the Irish personnel reinforced by armoured vehicles.  The armed elements began firing indiscriminately.  Private Coleman who was in a protected position, overlooking the checkpoint, was hit by a single round and suffered a minor stomach injury.  A few minutes later Corporal Ward, a gunner on an armoured personnel carrier which was part of the reinforcement sent to the scene, was hit by small arms fire.  The armoured personnel carrier immediately withdrew to a rendezvous with a medevac helicopter but Corporal Ward died from his wounds <Col N="480" /> within a matter of minutes before the helicopter evacuation could be effected.</P>
    <P>Private Coleman was evacuated to the United Nations Field Hospital at Nakuru.  He is now convalescing in the regimental aid post at the Irish batallion headquarters in Tibnin.</P>
    <P>Detailed investigations of the incident which resulted in the death of Corporal Ward and the wounding of Private Coleman are being conducted by UNIFIL headquarters and by the Irish contingent. The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Noel Dempsey, conveyed the grave concern of the Government to the Lebanese authorities in Beirut on Thursday last.  In particular, the Minister of State asked that the Lebanese Government use their authority and influence to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. The Government continue to avail of every opportunity at the United Nations and in meetings at diplomatic level to press for the implementation of the necessary measures to enable UNIFIL to carry out its mandate effectively.</P>
    <P>On my visit to Lebanon earlier this year I had the opportunity to observe at first hand the conditions under which UNIFIL is required to operate.  I was most impressed by the efficient and effective manner in which the Irish batallion are carrying out their duties under difficult conditions.  I was struck by the trust which the people of South Lebanon have in the Irish and of the part played by our troops in providing the environment for the rehabilitation of community life &mdash; that is very important.</P>
    <P>Ireland has won esteem for the role played by her troops in various peacekeeping operations.  Sadly, it has cost a heavy price in loss of life as we have seen most recently with the tragic death of Corporal Ward.  My colleagues in Government and I are proud of the contribution of Irish military personnel to the cause of world peace.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a thabhairt duit as deis a thabhairt <Col N="481" /> dom an t-ábhar seo a thógáil ar an athló, agus fáilte a chur roimh Aire na Gaeltachta agus Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta anseo sa Teach ag an am seo.  Sa cheantar fíor-Ghaeltachta, an Ghaeltacht Láir i dTír Chonaill, tá na comharthaí Gaelacha ansin go flúirseach, tá meánscoil lánGhaelach ann a bhfuil freastal an-mhaith air, tá na seirbhísí eaglaise uilig i nGaeilge agus tá coiste cultúrtha agus coiste paróiste an-ghníomhach ansin.  Bhí mé féin agus an tAire Stáit i láthair oíche Dé hAoine seo caite nuair a láinseáladh cúpla leabhar Gaeilge don phobal, agus ní rud neamhghnách í sin mar déantar go minic é.  Sílim gurb é sin an tríú huair a tharla a leithéid sin.  Mar sin, is ceantar é a bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt go flúirseach agus go fairsing ann, ó Bhaile na Finne go dtí an Bhrócaigh, agus an Cuimín.  Ach is é an deacracht mhór atá ann nach bhfuil fostaíocht dá laghad á cur ar bun do na daoine óga atá ina gcónaí ann.</P>
      <P>Tá géarchéim dhífhostaíochta ansin atá níos mó, is dócha, ná ceantar ar bith eile Gaeltachta i dTír Chonaill, taobh amuigh de chlann Uí Dhochartaigh a bhfuil cúpla duine acu ag plé le hadhmad. Na monarchana a bhí ansin, tá siad dúnta &mdash; tá Fine Glas, a bhí ansin, dúnta le cúig bliana anuas, agus Rodon, a raibh seisear ag obair ann, dúnta le cúpla seachtain anuas.  D'fhéadfá a rá nár cuireadh aon fhostaíocht ar bun ansin ó bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus aon jabanna a cruthaíodh, níl siad ann a thuilleadh. Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire féin, ar an Aire Stáit agus ar Údarás na Gaeltachta a seacht ndícheall a dhéanamh fostíocht a chur ar bun ansin do na daoine óga nach bhfuil aon rud le déanamh acu anois ach an ceantar a fhágáil agus dul ar an imirce mar go bhfuil an fheirmeoireacht, a raibh siad ag brath air go dtí seo, in ísle bhrí.</P>

      <P>Aithnítear an gá práinneach le tionscal nua don cheantar Ghaeltachta seo agus thig leis an Teachta McGinley <Col N="482" /> glacadh leis go bhfuil gach dar féidir á dhéanamh ag Udarás na Gaeltachta chun deiseanna breise fostaíochta a chruthú ann.  Anuas ar iarrachtaí an Údaráis féin déanfar tréaniarracht chun úsáid a bhaint as aon scéimeanna don cheantar ar nós chlárú Eorpach oileáin chun fostaíocht a chruthú ann.  Faoi mar is eol do choiste oibre Bhaile na Finne, atá ag feidhmiú mar eagraíocht fhorbartha áitiúil, bíonn an tÚdarás i gcomhairle leis an choiste go rialta chun forbairt an cheantair a chur chun cinn.  Beidh cruinniú ann anocht idir an tÚdaras agus an coiste oibre chun cúrsaí dífhostaíochta an cheantair a phlé. Chomh maith leis sin beidh an t-ábhar speisialta sin ar chlár an Údaráis don chéad chruinniú eile ag deireadh na míosa.</P>
      <P>Ar ndóigh, cuirfear fáilte roimh iarratais maidir le cúnamh chun tionscal fiúntach a bhunú sa cheantar, ní amháin ó lucht tionscail sa tír i gcoitinne ach ón iasacht freisin agus go háirithe ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta Láir féin.  D'ainneoin na n-iarrachtaí uilig is oth liom a rá nach bhfuil ceist na fostaíochta sásúil.  Bíonn iarrachtaí leanúnacha ar siúl ag an Údarás chun tograí fiúntacha a aimsiú do na monarchana folmha ansin, agus tá cruinniú práinneach á lorg acu leis na príomhaithe ón Fhionlainn chun todhchaí an ghnó seo a phlé.  Tá a fhios agam, mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta McGinley, go bhfuil bunábhar sa cheantar sin agus nuair a ceadaíodh an deontas don tógra sin bhíomar den bharúil go mbeadh go leor jabanna á gcruthú, ach níor tharla sé.  Tá dualgas, mar sin, ar an Údarás anois dul i dteagmháil le príomhaithe na gcomhlachtaí seo agus rud éigin a dhéanamh chun jabanna a chruthú chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
      <P>Chomh maith leis na ceantair sin thart ar Bhaile na Finne tá Gleann Fhinne agus an chuid eile den Ghaeltacht Láir a luaigh an Teachta McGinley.  Tá mé féin i dteagmháil le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta agus ag iarraidh orthu suíomh a cheannach agus réamh-mhonarcha a thógáil ansin mar is é mo bharúil féin go mbeadh sé iontach fóirsteanach do thionscal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> Is léir dúinn uilig nach bhfuil aon réiteach simplí ar fhadhb na dífhostaíochta, go háirithe nuair a chuirtear san áireamh go bhfuil an meath geilleagrach idirnáisiúnta ag cur isteach go mór ar thionscail easpórtála, ní amháin sa Ghaeltacht ach sa tír i gcoitinne, D'ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí uilig a bhíonn le sárú ag an Údarás le tionscail a mhealladh chuig ceantair atá achar fada ar siúl ó bhailte móra, agus <Col N="484" /> ó na calafoirt, d'éirigh leis an Údarás tionscail fhiúntacha a aimsiú sna blianta atá caite, agus beimidne sa Roinn ag tabhairt lántacaíochta don Údarás ionas go mbeidh siad ábalta níos mó tionscal a mhealladh go dtí na Gaeltachtaí éagsúla, agus go háirithe go dtí an Ghaeltacht atá faoi chaibidil againn faoi láthair.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 39 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Government statement which issued on 1 October 1992 and to the statement which Minister of State Noel Treacy issued yesterday confirming details of the new county enterprise partnership boards.  Copies of both have been laid before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statements outline the specific decisions which have been taken by the Government on the objectives, strategy, funding, staffing and the process of establishing <Col N="108" /> the county enterprise partnership boards.</P>
    <P>The partnership boards will play a major role in job creation at local level. They also represent a significant step forward in the devolution of power to local communities.  Ordinary people will have the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting their lives &mdash; decisions which up to now have been made at national level.  Each board, with directors drawn from all our main industries and State agencies, will provide for the close co-operation of the private sector and the public service.</P>
    <P>The chairperson of the boards will be an employer representative.  The other members of the boards will include the chairperson of the local authority, the county manager and representatives of local communities, social partners and public agencies.</P>
    <P>The partnership boards will have three key objectives, for the development of small and start up enterprises, employing up to 12 people; for training and education, especially as linked to enterprise development and for local community development.</P>
    <P>The partnership boards will prepare action plans for their counties and areas. These plans will set down specific proposals, to be implemented through decisions of three key sub-committees of the boards, in the areas of small and start up enterprise development, of training and education and of local community development.</P>
    <P>A forum of relevant local organisations will be held in each county quarterly, to ensure an exchange of ideas and feedback to local communities on the boards' activities.</P>
    <P>The funding of the boards will consist, in addition to the drawing together of existing publicly funded initiatives, of additional funds of over £100 million committed by the Irish financial institutions; in addition Irish public funds of £50 million will be provided by the Government and there will be additional EC Funds.</P>
    <P>The boards will each have a small core staff that will transfer to them from <Col N="109" /> county development teams, from regional tourism organisations, from IDA/ABT, Eolas, SFADCo/FAS/VECs and, where available, from the social partners, including private sector employers.</P>
    <P>The county development teams and regional tourism organisations will continue in existence in each case until partnership boards have been established in the relevant area.</P>
    <P>The process of establishing partnership boards will start immediately and will be undertaken in consultation with all existing interests at both local and regional level.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 83, 85 and 86 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My proposals for the integrated economic development of the Shannon Estuary were made in the context of a series of policies and measures to establish Ireland as an economically-strategic trading <Col N="110" /> bridgehead between the European Community and third countries.  This was one of my major messages during my recent promotional visit to the United States.</P>
    <P>At my request, the special economic development officer in my Department is currently co-ordinating the strategic planning and preliminary international marketing of this concept.  Discussions have recently been held with a number of relevant Ministers in the Russian Federation, and we are also talking to relevant interests in other countries such as Canada, Hungary, Mexico, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, China and South Africa. Tentative approaches have been made to additional countries and we are awaiting the reaction.  I stress that we are at a relatively early stage of strategic planning but I am confident that this will result in specific project proposals in the relatively near future.</P>
    <P>The maritime aspects of the development of the Shannon Estuary will, of course, be the direct responsibility of the Department of the Marine and of the various maritime authorities which operate under the aegis of that Department. The IDA and Shannon Development are actively involved in the planning and promotional work.</P>
    <P>I envisage that, subject to the success of our international marketing efforts, the provision of the necessary infrastructure to underpin the integrated economic development of the Shannon Estuary will be one of the major flagship projects for the next round of the EC Structural Funds and for the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>I intend to make a fuller statement on this project as soon as I have positive results from our international promotional programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I am happy to repeat in the House the welcome I expressed on 20 September, when it became clear that the people of France had endorsed the Treaty on European Union, as the Irish people did in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my statement, I also said that with the support of France now assured, it was important that the Member States now complete the ratification process.  I indicated that a Bill to amend the European Community Acts 1972-86, would be <Col N="112" /> ready for consideration by the Dáil and Seanad early in this session, thus enabling completion of the ratification process in Ireland.  In my statement I also said:</P>
    <P>The past week has been a turbulent one but the events we have seen serve only to underline the need for the strengthened integration in the monetary, economic and political spheres, based on firm programmes of economic and monetary convergence and of economic and social cohesion, for which the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty can pave the way.  Ireland will play its full part in driving this process forward.</P>
    <P>I also sent a message of congratulations to President Mitterrand.  In contacts with the British Presidency before the French referendum, Ireland joined with political leaders in France, Germany and Italy in urging the Presidency to convene a special meeting of the European Council, so that the Heads of State or Government could give a collective impetus to integration. I am glad that the Presidency responded positively and speedily to these urgings and that a special meeting of the European Council has now been fixed for 16 October in Birmingham.</P>
    <P>It emerged afterwards that the position I took was generally shared throughout the Community.  At a meeting in New York on 21 September, the General Affairs Council issued a declaration on the Maastricht Treaty, which stated that the Council &ldquo;attached a high priority to the speedy and successful conclusion of the ratification process, without reopening the present text, on the timing foreseen in Article R of the Treaty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Article refers to entry into force on 1 January next, although it also provides for later entry into force if this is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>In fact, some member states have already ratified, and there is confidence that the ratification procedures will be completed in at least ten member states by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed, as reflected in <Col N="113" /> the Council Declaration of 21 September, that there can and will be no renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Any fundamental changes or Protocols in the Treaty, requiring another constitutional referendum, would be unacceptable to Ireland, whose people voted by a 69 per cent majority for the existing proposals.</P>
    <P>We are indeed anxious that the whole Community should move forward together, as Twelve, and we are prepared to co-operate in any steps that will help to facilitate ratification in Denmark or any other member state, so long as such steps uphold the Community achievements and do not impede the dynamic of integration.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear before in the House and it has been borne out further by recent developments that none of the member states would be prepared to consider, before they have completed their ratification, holding an Intergovernmental Conference to delete or amend Protocol No. 17, if we did propose that course.  I would also refer Deputies to the Solemn Declaration adopted by the Community on this project.</P>
    <P>The Presidency have indicated that the Birmingham European Council will deal with the Danish situation, the EMS and making the Community more open to its citizens.  In preparation for the meeting and to get across the Irish viewpoint, in addition to any message to President Mitterrand, I have met the British and Spanish Prime Ministers and there have been Ministerial and diplomatic contacts with Germany, the Netherlands and France.  In all these contacts, I have stressed that Ireland does not favour a two-speed Community in the monetary or any other sphere, but that if such a Community did come about, Ireland would wish to be with the central core.</P>
    <P>The continuing debate on the Maastricht Treaty in the member states has revealed a range of anxieties and concerns, which the Government recognise would suggest that more needs to be done to bring the Community closer to its citizens.</P>
    <P>The Government are prepared to co-operate <Col N="114" /> to this end and to consider the appropriate application of the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 3B of the Treaty but this cannot involve calling into question fundamental aspects of the Treaty of Rome, particularly in regard to the right of initiative of the Commission. The Government are exercising vigilance to ensure that &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; is not used as a cover for rolling back Community achievements or heading off further integration in areas where this is desirable. Our viewpoint on this matter was clearly set out at the General Affairs Council this week and there was also full agreement on these points when I met Prime Minister Gonzalez on Monday.</P>
    <P>At home, we are examining how best to ensure that our people are well informed about and understand Community matters.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive, together. The four Associated Banks &mdash; Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Ulster Bank and National Irish Bank &mdash; Woodchester <Col N="115" /> Credit Lyonnais Bank, ICC, ACC, the Trustee Savings Bank and the Irish Permanent Building Society have collectively committed funds of £95 million to be used in conjunction with the County Enterprise Partnership Boards.</P>
      <P>These funds will be available for loans on favourable terms, including no guarantees in the case of incorporated entities and the underwriting criteria will reflect a balanced view of the financial institutions' good commercial practice and social responsibility in playing their part in achieving the aims of the County Enterprise Partnerships in tackling the unemployment problem.  In addition, there will be an active policy by the Banks to provide specialist staff to assist in the evaluation and operation of projects on a &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; basis.</P>
      <P>Enterprise projects submitted to County Enterprise Partnership Boards for funding will be evaluated in terms of commercial viability by an Enterprise Sub-Committee of the Board.  Personnel designated by the financial institutions will assist in the evaluation and the Board will decide the most appropriate method of funding, whether by direct grant, loan, interest subsidy or equity for approved projects.  Officials of my Department are now liaising, and will continue to liaise, with the financial institutions on the detailed implementation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Discussions are continuing with the financial institutions in particular with other Building Societies and with the Insurance Companies on further contributions to the overall Enterprise Fund. The Government are satisfied that there will be a further positive response from the financial institutions arising from those discussions.  Equity capital will be included in the further contributions, in particular from the Insurance Companies.</P>

      <P>The Government undertook, in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, to increase on a gradual and sustained basis the number of people with disabilities employed in the public service. To oversee this commitment a Monitoring Committee comprising representatives of public service unions and management was established.</P>
      <P>Arising from a meeting I had with the Forum of People with Disabilities in May of this year, I agreed to expand the terms of reference of the Monitoring Committee to provide for consideration of the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector and I agreed that the Forum would be represented on the Committee.</P>
      <P>In July of this year, arising from a proposal by the Monitoring Committee, the Government decided that each member of Government should be responsible for the employment of people with disabilities in the area for which they have direct statutory control and/or functional responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Monitoring Committee, which has met on four occasions to date, is at present examining the situation in relation to the implementation of the <Col N="117" /><i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitment, in particular how to achieve a 3 per cent level for the employment of people with disabilities in Government Departments, State Bodies, Local Authorities and Health Boards. The Committee are also considering how best a quota system could be extended to the private sector.</P>
    <P>After a period of twelve months of operation of the Monitoring Committee, the Government will review the position in relation to the quota to consider if, in particular, legislation is necessary for its implementation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> As Deputies will be aware, the Government has considered the recommendations of the Culliton report and the Moriarty Task Force on a number of issues including the matter of agency restructuring.  They decided on a structure which met the essence and objectives of the recommendations while ensuring that appropriate linkages and coherence was maintained between the arrangements to promote the development of indigenous industry and those to promote inward investment.</P>
    <P>This structure will involve the establishment of a new agency for industrial development with separate and independent divisions for: (i) the promotion, support and development of indigenous industry, and (ii) the attraction of investment from overseas.</P>
    <P>There will be separate boards with executive and non-executive members for the indigenous development and overseas divisions, and separate grant-in-aid allocations will be made to each board to achieve transparency as to costs and targets.</P>
    <P>I envisage seeking Government approval for the scheme of legislation to give effect to this decision this month and introducing the Bill in the current session.  The establishment of the new agency will then proceed quickly after enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of additional funds or resources does not arise at this stage.  I would expect at the very least that the new more focused approach and integrated delivery of services should result in greater effectiveness and efficiency, and in a cost effective manner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47, 48, 55, 57, 81 and 103 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent dramatic fall in the value of sterling, coupled with the ongoing turbulance <Col N="121" /> in the currency markets, has created serious difficulties for a number of Irish firms.  On Thursday 24 September 1992 I asked my Department to undertake, as a matter of urgency, a detailed analysis of the problem.  Subsequently, on 29 September 1992, the Government decided to establish a working group, under the chairmanship of my Department, and representative also of the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food and the Marine, and semi-State Bodies as appropriate, to look at the nature and content of the problems arising for firms as a result of the decline in the value of sterling and to make recommendations as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The working group's report was considered by the Government yesterday.</P>
    <P>The working group concluded that many manufacturing firms face serious difficulties in maintaining positive margins on sales in the UK market and in those parts of the domestic market and certain major overseas markets which are subject to strong price competition from UK firms.</P>
    <P>These problems are not confined to specific sectors; firms in all sectors of industry have suffered immediate erosion of margins arising from the devaluation of sterling.  However, the sectors which are most badly affected are: clothing, food products, small engineering firms, furniture and joinery, building products, saw-mills and firms which sell intermediate products.</P>
    <P>In general the working group concluded that the firms under greatest pressure have some or all of the following main characteristics:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a high level of exports to UK,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a high level of exposure to competition from UK competitors,</P>
    <P>&mdash;low levels of input purchases (e.g. raw materials) from the UK</P>
    <P>&mdash;low margins,</P>
    <P>&mdash;high gearing,</P>
    <P>&mdash;high level of debtor exposure and,</P>
    <P>&mdash;little or no forward currency cover.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> The Government have carefully considered the report of the working group. They have decided to immediately establish a Market Development Fund of £50 million for the period up to the end of March 1993 to assist firms which have been seriously affected by the recent turmoil in exchange rates.</P>
    <P>By helping firms to help themselves the Fund will also contribute to the achievement of the stability necessary to maintain Ireland's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism at a time of considerable uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The Fund will be administered by a special Management Team drawn from the relevant State bodies.  The establishment and management of the Fund will be supervised and directed by a Management Board which will comprise the Managing Directors/Chief Executives of ABT, FAS and IDA together with representatives from the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour and the Marine, and a representative from the industry/employer bodies and ICTU.  In establishing the Fund, the Government emphasised that assistance would be directed very specifically at firms which would have temporary difficulty in maintaining employment and in adjusting to the recent fundamental changes in the market place arising from the devaluation of sterling.  Firms will need to demonstrate the ability, commitment and actions being taken to manage their way out of current difficulties.  Operational criteria for support under the Fund will be worked out in the next few days.  These will concentrate on providing help for firms whose profitability and employment is threatened because of the devaluation of sterling.  It is not intended as a permanent subsidy; it will be available only to enable firms to make the changes necessary following the sudden currency changes of recent weeks.  There will be a formal review of the operation of the Fund at the end of this year.</P>

      <P>No recent assessment has been done in my Department concerning the effect of Government regulations on the profitability of small and medium sized businesses.  However, the Industrial Costs Monitoring Group undertook a review in the period 1988 to 1990 of the statutory and information requirements which impact on business. In the course of their work the Group considered approximately 100 proposals from various industry bodies to lighten the administrative burden on business.  A number of these proposals resulted in the implementation of recommendations made to Departments.</P>
      <P>All proposals for Government for new legislation or programmes are expected to provide an assessment of the likely cost on industry and the traded sectors. This process serves to inform both sponsoring Departments and the Government on the likely impact of proposals on business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see a need at present for a committee on competitiveness of the kind envisaged by the Deputy.  The issues of industrial competitiveness are much broader than any regulatory burden; in current circumstances, the most immediate issue of concern is that relating to the collapse of the value of sterling and the consequent erosion in the competitive position of some Irish firms.  I have dealt <Col N="124" /> separately with the steps being taken to deal with that problem.  More broadly, the issue of industrial competitiveness substantially influenced the work of the Industrial Policy Review Group and is also informing the work of other Government Task Forces and Committees.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 51, 62, 102 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the statement which I issued on 8 September, 1992, copies of which have been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Industrial Policy Review Group was submitted to me in January of this year, just six months after <Col N="125" /> I had instituted the Group under the chairmanship of Mr. Jim Culliton.</P>
    <P>It recommended a procedure to assist implementation of its recommendations, which the Government accepted immediately, in January last.  That procedure provided for the establishment of a Task Force to follow-up on the implementation of the Culliton Report.  The Task Force, chaired by Dr. P.J. Moriarty, included leading people from business and the Secretaries of relevant Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Moriarty Tasks Force has now submitted two reports to me on implementation of the Culliton Group's recommendations.  The reports cover a wide range of Government policies that come within the remit of several Ministers and Departments.</P>
    <P>The first report of the Moriarty Task Force contained some 48 separate recommendations all of which have been agreed in whole or in part by the Government. The Ministers responsible have announced or will announce details of actions to implement the recommendations in each area.</P>
    <P>In my own area of responsibility the Culliton recommendations to achieve the reform of the role, functions and organisation of the Department of Industry and Commerce have been accepted.  This involves the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The role of the Department will become predominantly one of policy determination for industrial development and for the supervision of the implementation of that policy.  This will include the promotion of the importance of a supportive business-related and regulatory environment for industry and business;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Specific objectives and targets for the boards and management of the industrial promotion agencies will be established and published;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The staff resources of the Department will be strengthened to assist in the enhanced policy role of the Department;</P>
    <P>&mdash;An Advisory Board on industrial <Col N="126" /> and commercial policy will be established to provide the Minister and management of the Department with expert advice and support additional to what is available at present;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The review of industrial performance, undertaken and published by the Department at three-yearly intervals at present, will be widened to cover a review of industrial policy and its implementation covering the achievement, or otherwise, of the objectives and targets set for the industrial development agencies;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Explicit budgets for the attraction of internationally mobile projects will be established with the objective of getting better value for money for a given level of projects/employment creation;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The shift of emphasis from grants to repayable or participating forms of finance for indigenous industry will be continued to meet gaps in the financial markets and in the supply of seed capital;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The grant-aid budget (and other supports) will be used to help develop industrial clusters and segments of national competitive advantage;</P>
    <P>&mdash;More effective EC restrictions on State aids for industry, particularly in the more developed member states, will be pressed and the replacement of national schemes for export credit insurance by a common EC-wide scheme will be sought;</P>
    <P>&mdash;A commercial services-oriented structure will be developed for both the Companies Registration Office and the Patents Office;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Science and Technology programmes will be developed as a more central instrument of industrial policy and promotion and their relevance and contribution to the development of Irish industry will be increased.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided on a new structure for the industrial development agencies, involving the establishment of a new single agency with <Col N="127" /> separate divisions for the support and development of indigenous industry and for the attraction of investment from overseas.  Legislation to give effect to this decision is now being drafted and I expect to introduce the Bill in the current session.</P>
    <P>I have submitted the second report of the Moriarty Task Force for Government consideration and I expect that the necessary decisions will be taken soon on that report and announced in due course.</P>
    <P>In connection with the cost of the Culliton report I refer Deputies to the answer given in this House on 10 March 1992 (Volume 417, No. 1; Column 108) in which I detailed costs.  The total cost of commissioning and publishing the report was a little more than £337,400, as stated in reply to the earlier question.</P>

      <P>An analysis by my Department for the period 1981 to 1990 inclusive shows that a total of £1,626 million in 1990 price terms was paid in grants by the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Of this total £957 million went to overseas firms and £669 million went to Irish owned firms.</P>
      <P>2,243 grant aided firms which existed at end 1980 or which established in the period 1981 to 1990 had closed by end 1990.  331 of these firms were overseas owned and 1,912 were Irish owned.</P>
      <P>The grant payments in respect of these closed firms were £161 million in the case of overseas firms and £152 million in the case of Irish owned firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála provides grant <Col N="128" /> assistance to firms which have their marketing control function located in Ireland: it does not discriminate on the basis of the nationality of ownership of firms.  ABT estimates that in the period 1980 to 1990 a gross total of £42.2m was paid out in marketing grants.  Of this amount, some £5.4m has been repaid or is due to be repaid, leaving net grant payments for the period at £36.8m.  The Bord estimates that some 10-15 per cent of grant-aided companies subsequently ceased trading, with the majority of these firms receiving smaller grants and employing less than 25 persons.  It is also estimated that some £3.5m in grant aid was paid to companies which subsequently ceased trading.</P>

      <P>High costs, whether insurance costs or any other costs, have an adverse impact on the traded sector of the economy in terms of output, employment and the ability of firms to compete in the market place.</P>
      <P>The cost of insurance is substantially determined by the frequency of claims and the cost of settling those claims.  In this country claims and the cost of settling them are abnormally high.  Effective risk management by business, including greater attention to safety by employers and employees in the workplace and on the roads, can yield positive results in terms of lower insurance costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government continues to play its role in attempting to improve the environment for insurance by encouraging greater safety in the workplace through the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Labour. <Col N="130" /> Similarly, following the work of the Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance, which I chaired, considerable Government attention is being given to road safety.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, with the support of the Minister for Justice, continues to apply stricter enforcement of the road traffic laws and the Minister for the Environment will shortly be proposing substantial improvements to road traffic legislation.  Also, the Minister for Justice is preparing changes to improve the operations of the Courts in resolving personal injury actions by means of a series of legislative changes aimed at bringing about a more effective and efficient system for dealing with liability insurance claims.</P>
    <P>The impact of all of these measures on the cost of insurance will ultimately depend on the timing and extent of their implementation and, most importantly, the attitude of the insurance industry, the legal profession, other professionals (including doctors) and the general public, including business and road users.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Oral Questions Nos. 73 and 78 and Written Question No. 113 together.</P>
      <P>The Inter-Ministerial Group on Motor Insurance, which I chaired, identified a list of measures to improve the environment for insurance, including motor insurance for young and more mature drivers.  The group has been a success in the sense that the Ministers for Justice and the Environment are in the process of initiating a series of measures designed to improve safety on the roads, reduce uninsured driving, and improve the efficiency of the Courts in resolving personal injury actions.  Where the implementation of measures requires legislation, such legislation has been, or will be, proposed by the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Justice. The Deputies will appreciate that questions about progress on such legislation are a matter for the Ministers concerned.</P>
      <P>The Deputies should be aware that a comprehensive list of the measures identified by the inter-ministerial group to improve the environment for insurance, has already been given to this House, notably by myself and the Minister for the Environment on 2 and 3 July 1991. Therefore, the recommendations of the Group are detailed in the records of this House and consequently are in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To attempt to quantify the overall impact of the measures identified by the inter-ministerial group on insurance premia would not be feasible.  Clearly the impact of the measures on insurance premia will depend on the timing and the extent of their implementation and most importantly the attitude of the insurance industry, the legal profession, other professionals including doctors, and the general <Col N="133" /> public including business, and road users.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Deputies that my primary responsibility as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory solvency and reserve requirements.  I do not set, or indeed approve, insurance rates.  This is an underwriting matter which is the responsibility of insurers to decide in the light of their particular circumstances and assessment of the market.</P>
    <P>In conclusion might I add that should it be considered helpful to the objective of improving the environment for insurance the inter-ministerial group may meet again.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 115 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has not sought to have evaluations of the sort referred to by the Deputy carried out specifically for public liability insurance.  However, I would point out that personal injury compensation costs can constitute a significant proportion of the costs of public liability insurance claims.  The Deputy should be well aware from numerous discussions in this House that personal injury compensation costs in this country <Col N="134" /> are out of line with the levels of such compensation in other countries.</P>
    <P>As the insurance supervisory authority I must add that the cost of insurance, including public liability insurance, is substantially determined by the frequency of claims and the average cost of settling claims.  Clearly the cost of such claims can only be met by insurers if the premiums received adequately reflect the cost of such claims.  Furthermore the underwriting losses on liability insurance as a whole have been increasing in recent years.</P>
    <P>While the Government will continue to consider initiatives designed to improve the environment for insurance, including liability insurance, it is unrealistic to expect that premiums will not reflect the cost of claims.  Insurance proposers and indeed the general public can and, in my view, ought to assist the process of improving the environment for insurance by increased attention to safety and by perhaps a more considered approach to the quantum of compensation.</P>

      <P>The Inspector's Interim Report was placed in the Oireachtas Library and published on 31 July last.  I would hope that the investigation can be completed and the Final Report prepared within the next couple of months but unfortunately I cannot be definitive on this timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that payments totalling IR£250,160.46 have been made to the Inspector to date.  In addition, my Department has paid a further IR£84,414.93 to the Revenue Commissioners, i.e., Withholding Tax at 29 per cent.  However, I should point out <Col N="135" /> that a substantial proportion of these costs relate to litigation and are recoverable arising from court cases where costs were awarded in favour of the Inspector.</P>

      <P>The amount of export credit insurance cover which was given in respect of beef exported to Iraq in each of the years 1983 to 1985 was as follows: 1983 &mdash; Nil; 1984 &mdash; Nil; 1985 &mdash; £5.3 million; 1986 &mdash; £4.9 million.  In respect of 1987 and 1988 amounts of £41.2 million and £49.6 million respectively were purported to be covered by export credit insurance.  However, as I have previously indicated to the House, an investigation into certain discrepancies between the official trade statistics for beef exports to Iraq in those years and the value of such exports declared for insurance and purported to be covered, showed that 38.4 per cent of the beef declared was sourced outside the State.  This was a fundamental breach of the policies of insurance granted to the companies concerned.  The insurance policies granted in respect of such exports were consequently void <i>ab initio</i> in accordance with the terms thereof.</P>
      <P>No cover was provided in respect of beef exported to Iraq in 1989 or 1990.  Cover for Iraq was suspended on 6 February, 1989.</P>

      <P>Sculptors, like all visual artists, are eligible to apply for individual awards offered by the Arts Council.  Bursaries are made available for major work projects and are intended primarily to assist development and growth in the work or professional skills of artists in receipt of such bursaries.  Priority is given to artists working full time.  These grants are awarded once a year, in April/May.</P>
      <P>Materials or documentation grants, the upper limit of which is £500, are offered by the Arts Council twice a year to artists in April and October.  Moneys are not generally made available for the setting up of a business or private sculpture workshops.  Individuals successful in obtaining a grant may choose to use it towards establishing their own sculpture facilities.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council support a number of group studios throughout the country, where there are basic sculpture facilities. In addition to this, the council have provided a capital grant of £100,000 and grant-aid of £35,000 in 1992 to the National Sculpture Factory in Cork, which has facilities for all sculptural media (particularly on a large scale), together with a capital grant of £750,000 and grant-aid of £50,000 in 1992 to the Fire Station Artists' Studios, recently built in Dublin, where there is provision made for a large sculpture workshop, fully fitted.  It is not the policy of the Arts Council to fund individual enterprises but, rather, to fund facilities which can be availed of by many artists, both long and short term, with technical supervision if desired.</P>
      <P>The county enterprise partnership boards which are being established throughout the country will have, as part of their remit, the funding of small and start-up businesses.  It would therefore be open to sculptors starting businesses to apply for funding of their enterprises to the local boards when established.</P>

      <P>A scheme for the sale of Other ranks married quarters located outside of military barracks was introduced by my Department in 1988.  A total of 176 married quarters has been sold to date to the occupants under the terms of the scheme and a further 16 are still in the process of sale.</P>
      <P>The price of each quarter was the current market value as assessed by the Commissioner of Valuation less the following discounts: (1) a discount of 40 per cent of the market value for all eligible occupants, (2) an additional 10 per cent discount for the occupants of quarters which were first occupied prior to 1st January, 1960 and (3) a discount of £2,000 in lieu of the grant to first time purchasers of new private houses.</P>
      <P>(The nett sale price was subject to a minimum price of £4,000.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> Apart from a restrictive covenant on re-sale within a period of ten years without the prior consent of the Minister for Defence as well as an exemption from the payment of stamp duty on the conveyance the standard terms of sale applied.</P>
    <P>In addition seven officers' married quarters located outside of barracks were sold to the occupants since 1987 at market value as assessed by the Commissioner of Valuation.  The following statement indicates the location and number of all the above-mentioned properties.</P>
    <P>In all cases financing arrangements were a matter for individual purchasers and the full purchase price was payable on completion of the usual legal formalities.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Government policy any military property which is surplus to requirements is offered for sale if it is not required for other State purposes.</P>
      <P>As regards the disposal of military barracks and posts the Government decided that Collins Barracks, Dublin should be sold.  Arrangements are being made to re-locate the troops stationed there and to sell the property on the open market.</P>
      <P>Griffith Barracks, Dublin was vacated and handed over to the Office of Public Works in 1988 and was sold in 1991.</P>
      <P>The military post at Fort Dunree, County Donegal was vacated in 1990. The Old Fort, incorporating a military museum, is being handed over to Donegal County Council and the balance of the property is being offered for sale on the open market.</P>

    <P>Fort Camden, County Cork was handed over to Cork County Council in 1989 and arrangements are being made <Col N="149" /> to sell the balance of the lands adjoining the fort.</P>
    <P>A scheme for the sale of Other Ranks married quarters located outside of military barracks was introduced by my Department in 1988.  A total of 176 married quarters has to date been sold to the occupants under the terms of the scheme and a further 16 are still in the process of sale.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, 39 properties throughout the country have been sold by my Department since the beginning of 1989.  In addition, miscellaneous surplus properties continue to be sold including the following properties in County Cork which are currently in process of sale: 18 acres at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, the Caretakers Cottage, Ballincollig, 5 acres at Fort Camden and 5 houses at Bere Island.  The following further properties will be disposed of as soon as possible: 7 acres at Fort Camden, 9 houses at the Coastguard Station, Crosshaven and the former FCA Hall, Aghabullogue.</P>

      <P>The Department's site in question is not landlocked and would not be surplus to requirements until the military facilities there were relocated.  Four options for <Col N="150" /> access to the development firm's landlocked site have been identified.  It is understood, however, that the firm would prefer to acquire the Department's site both for development and as an access route to its existing site.</P>
      <P>It is also understood that the planning situation in relation to access to the development firm's site is being addressed by Dublin Corporation.  As far as my Department are concerned the various issues involved, including the arrangements for the relocation of the military facilities are being, and will be, pursued as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The factual position regarding the part of the site previously sold by my Department to the developer is that the area in question was declared surplus to military requirements in 1991.  As it was landlocked by the developer's original site and St. Bricin's Hospital grounds, agreement was reached to sell it to the developer on the basis of the selling price advised by the Commissioner of Valuation. The transaction was in accordance with the rules governing such disposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 108 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased competition from Community insurers has been a reality in Ireland since May, 1976 with the implementation of the first Establishment Directive allowing freedom of establishment for Community insurers on either a branch or head office basis.  At present over 70 per cent of non-life insurance undertakings operating on this basis in Ireland are foreign owned, the vast majority of which have head offices in the Community.  In June, 1991 regulations were enacted (S.I. No. 142/1991) <Col N="152" /> implementing the Second non-life services Directive which allowed cross-border community-wide freedom of services for most classes of non-life insurance with the exception of third party motor liability insurance.  These regulations provide that insurers underwriting &ldquo;mass&rdquo; risks business (for private individuals or small commercial organizations) from abroad are required to fulfil relatively stringent requirements including the necessity to be authorized by the Minister.  The more stringent requirements for the &ldquo;mass&rdquo; risks policyholders have as their aim consumer protection for the smaller, more vulnerable policyholder.  On the other hand, insurers underwriting &ldquo;large&rdquo; risks as defined in the regulations are subject to less onerous requirements, on the basis that such clients are well able to look after themselves in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I recently signed the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) (Amendment) Regulations, 1992, referred to in Deputy Howlin's question, which will give effect to the Motor Insurance Services Directive.  These regulations will allow non-established EC insurers to offer motor insurance cover on a cross-border basis throughout the EC.  The regulations will come into force on 20 November, 1992.  As with the non-life insurance regulations mentioned above these regulations also provide for more stringent requirements for insurers underwriting &ldquo;mass&rdquo; risks insurance business.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the special derogations which were available to Ireland for phasing in both the second non-life services Directive and the motor insurance services Directive have now been waived by me in accordance with the Government's commitment to a single insurance market, the hope of increased competition for the benefit of policyholders and an improvement in the general availability of non-life insurance overall.</P>
    <P>The single non-life insurance market will be complete once the Third non-life insurance Framework Directive is implemented by all member states, by 1 <Col N="153" /> July, 1994.  This Directive is the logical progression from the partial liberalisation already achieved under the second non-life services directive and the motor insurance services Directive.  The third non-life insurance Framework Directive will institute a uniform Community-wide system of authorisation whereby overall licensing and supervision of all the business of an insurance company will be the responsibility of the member state where the head office of the company is located.  Ireland has sought no special transitional arrangements in relation to the implementation of this Directive.</P>
    <P>Overall while it is expected that the full opening-up of the Community market may intensify competition on price, cover availability and quality of service, it should be noted that increased competition of itself will not automatically lead to a reduction in insurance costs in Ireland.  At the end of the day prudent insurers must set their premium rates to match the compensation payout. In this regard, the level and frequency of awards existing in each individual member state will have a major bearing on the premium rates ultimately charged by both established and services insurers in the marketplace.</P>

      <P>An individual who wishes to take up residence abroad in circumstances in which he will not be liable to Irish tax must be resident abroad for a period which includes a full tax year.  He will remain resident for Irish tax purposes for any tax year in which he spends at least 183 days in Ireland.  He will also remain resident for any tax year in which he spends substantial periods in Ireland or in certain circumstances if he has a place of abode available to him in Ireland.</P>
      <P>For a visit to be regarded as substantial the individual must spend at least 92 days in Ireland in the tax year and he must also have spent time in Ireland in the four preceding tax years.  The total time spent in Ireland in the preceding years must have exceeded 368 days.</P>
      <P>An individual who goes abroad for purposes other than work will be resident in Ireland if he has available to him a place of abode in Ireland and makes a visit of whatever length to the country in a tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the individual who leaves Ireland is a director or employee paid from Ireland the employer is liable to deduct PAYE <Col N="156" /> until he receives notification from the Inspector of Taxes that Irish tax is not due.  If the Inspector becomes aware of a change in circumstances the notification may be withdrawn.  If the individual becomes resident while a notification is in force he becomes a chargeable person subject to self assessment.  He is accordingly bound to make returns and payments to the Irish tax authorities.</P>
    <P>If the individual was a chargeable person under the self assessment system prior to going abroad he would continue to be required to lodge returns until the Inspector of Taxes was satisfied that there is no liability to Irish tax.  The circumstances of individuals not required to make returns for reasons of non residence are reviewed periodically to ensure that they continue to be outside the Irish tax net.</P>
    <P>Individuals who leave Ireland would be required to make a return under the self assessment system if they become Irish resident for tax purposes and are chargeable persons as defined in section 9 of the Finance Act, 1988.  The Revenue procedures will operate to ensure that the individual makes returns.  The individual's residence position since he left Ireland would be examined as part of the screening of returns.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>¹ A tax unit is an individual person, or a married couple who have elected or have been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband.</P>
    <P>² The figure for self-employed tax units on tax record is the number who are assessed to tax through the Self-Assessment system on income from a trade, profession, investment or rental sources.  In some of these cases the predominant income is from employment which is taxed through the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>³ The difference between the number of tax units on record and the number who pay tax is generally accounted for by the operation of the personal allowances or exemption limits and also, in the case of self-employed persons, the availability of reliefs such as capital allowances, losses and retirement annuities.</P>
    <P>4 The figures for expenses relate to expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of employment by PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Expenses such as business interest, telephone, light, heating and business motoring which are incurred in acquiring an income from self-employment are deducted prior to the determination of profits for tax purposes and are not included in income tax returns.  Accordingly, statistics are not available which would enable the information requested to be provided.</P>
    <P>Some £375 million was allowed in tax deductions for 1989-90 in respect of other business-related reliefs for which the relevant statistics are available, namely, capital allowances, losses and retirement annuity premiums.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of persons in each tax category, presumably the Deputy has in mind the number of taxpaying units in each tax band.  That information is as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>the Culliton report recommendations which primarily concern my Department <Col N="159" /> relate to taxation.  Their essential thrust is that, subject to the overriding need to continue to pursue sound budgetary policy, the tax base should be extended both within the income tax area and outside it, and marginal income tax rates lowered.  This thrust endorses the recommendations of several earlier reports, notably that of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Government taxation policy in recent years was already along these lines, and much progress has been made in implementing it in conjunction with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Review of the Programme for Government, concluded in October 1991, promised a radical overhaul of the entire tax code, involving a systematic curtailment of tax exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary tax rates on a phased basis, in order to reduce marginal income tax rates.  Consistent with that, the Finance Act, 1992 curtailed a number of tax reliefs and exemptions in order to help fund the major package of income tax reliefs I announced in the 1992 budget. This package cost an estimated £280 million in a full year and involved a substantial extension of the standard rate-band as well as reduction of the top tax rate to 48 per cent and of the standard rate to 27 per cent.  Further measures in the area of taxation are of course matters for consideration in the context of the 1993 budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 121 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>Section 439 of the Income Tax Act 1967, which is an anti-avoidance provision, provides that, subject to certain exceptions, income covenanted by one person to another is to be treated for tax purposes as the income of the disponer rather than of the recipient.  One of the exceptions is where income is covenanted to an individual for a period which is capable of exceeding six years.  In the case of income covenanted to a child of the disponer, the child must have attained his/her majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1979 introduced the condition that income in excess of 5 per cent of the total income of the disponer, covenanted to a child or grandchild, would continue to be regarded as the income of the disponer.  This restriction, and the non-recognition of covenants in favour of minor children of the disponer, protect the Exchequer from the very <Col N="161" /> large tax avoidance potential if these types of covenant were permitted without limit.  The Finance Act 1986, by applying to the tax code the provisions of the age of Majority Act 1985, reducing the age of majority to 18 years, made the provision of relevance to parents of children in third level education.  I would point out in this context that since that development, the cost of tax relief on covenants rose from some £3.9 million in the 1985-86 tax year to an estimated £26 million in the 1991-92 tax year.  The great bulk of this increased cost is accounted for by covenants in favour of third-level students.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of providing greater assistance to certain parents, it should be noted that direct State assistance to third-level education already amounts to some £271 million, while the higher education grants scheme costs a further £38 million.  In addition, the income limits applying under the scheme have recently been significantly increased and other aspects of it improved.  Any further expenditure in this area would have to be considered in the context of the high levels of expenditure already being incurred and the many other pressures on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The fact that a percentage limit applies to covenants from parents to an eligible child or eligible children means that higher-income parents can benefit more than middle &mdash; or lower &mdash; income parents.  It should of course be recalled that children of higher-income parents are unlikely to be in receipt of higher education grants. Finally, I would point out to the Deputies that the Review of the Programme for Government promises a radical overhaul of the entire tax code, involving a systematic curtailment of exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary tax rates, with a view to reducing marginal income tax rates.</P>

      <P>In the budget, I announced that the Finance Bill would contain provisions to enable me to extend tax clearance to licences such as those for pubs, dance halls, employment agencies, bookmakers and so on.  It was decided to concentrate initially on liquor licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  Accordingly, the Finance Act, 1992 (section 156) provides for the presentation of a tax clearance certificate before an intoxicating liquor retailer's licence may be granted by the Revenue Commissioners.  No provison has been made in the Act in relation to the issue of any other licence or permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Hurleys have been standard-rated for VAT since the introduction of the tax in 1972.  Over the years, numerous requests for zero-rating have been turned down because such a move is precluded by EC law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New VAT rules have recently been agreed at EC level to apply when the Single Market comes into being with effect from 1 January 1993.  In so far as VAT rates are concerned, these rules provide for: (i) the retention, at least <Col N="163" /> until end-1996, of those <i>zero-rates</i> and <i>super-reduced</i> rates (e.g. our livestock rate of 2.7 per cent) which were already in force on 1 January 1991; (ii) the application of one or two optional <i>reduced rates</i>, subject to a minimum of 5 per cent, to a specified list of goods and services; (iii) the application of a standard rate, subject to a minimum of 15 per cent, to all other taxable goods and services not covered by (i) and (ii) above.</P>
    <P>Since sports goods generally, including hurleys, are not included on the list of specified goods and services referred to at (ii), and the provision at (i) only relates to pre-existing rates, it follows that they must remain subject to the standard rate of VAT in the post-1992 regime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The application of VAT at point of entry must cease with effect from 1 January 1993 in so far as intra-Community trade is concerned because its continuation would not be compatible with the abol-ition <Col N="164" /> of fiscal frontiers.  Dismantling this regime will cost the Exchequer some £200 million for Community goods alone and a loss of this magnitude will pose considerable difficulties in the context of the 1993 budgetary arithmetic.</P>
      <P>Abolition of VAT at point of entry on non-Community goods would cost some £50 million and this further loss would be unsustainable next year.  Accordingly, I have decided that this aspect of the import regime will have to be retained. This is wholly permissible under Community law and I understand that the majority of member states will be pursuing the same path as Ireland in this regard.</P>
      <P>Even if it were feasible to allow imports from &ldquo;third world&rdquo; countries to enter the State free of VAT &mdash; they would still become liable to VAT at a later point &mdash; it is not apparent that this would contribute in any significant way to furthering their economic development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 135, 136 and 137 together.  I am aware that the hare is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  However, a number of traditional hunting practices, not involving firearms, are permissible in relation to this species, under the Act.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, Office of Public Works, is satisfied that the conservation status of the hare species is satisfactory and that the species is not under threat.</P>
      <P>No formal survey has been carried out but in view of concerns expressed, I have had discussions with the National Parks and Wildlife Service regarding the feasibility of carrying out a national survey of wild hares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the gardaí are investigating <Col N="173" /> the alleged coursing of sick hares at the national coursing meeting in February, 1992.  Any decision to issue prosecution proceedings is a matter for them.</P>
    <P>The allegations against one of the Clubs referred to have, following investigation by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, proved unsustainable.  The allegations against the other Clubs are being investigated by the gardaí.  Pending the outcome of investigations, which may result in prosecutions, I do not propose to make any further comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 139 and 141 together.  The Irish Coursing Club, Davis Road, Clonmel, County Tipperary, applied, on behalf of its affiliated clubs <Col N="175" /> in 1991 and 1992, for a licence to capture live hares by means of nets.  The Irish Coursing Club has furnished up-to-date returns giving particulars of numbers captured and released and of the locations of releases made by the 75 of its affiliated clubs which netted hares during the 1990-91 and 1991-92 Open Seasons.  A further 15 clubs affiliated to the Irish Coursing Club run open meetings.</P>
      <P>No application for a licence was refused.  There is no charge for a licence.</P>
      <P>One hundred and five officers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service have been appointed since 1988 under section 72 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the European Communities (Wildlife Act, 1976) (Amendment) Regulations, for the purposes of the Act.  Prior to 1988 a number of Forestry Service Personnel had been appointed authorised officers under section 72 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, as the Wildlife Service and Forestry were then part of the same service.</P>
      <P>The allegations against one of the clubs referred to have, following investigation by rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service proved unsustainable.</P>
      <P>Garda investigations are on going into the allegations that the other Club netted hares outside the licensing period.  Pending the outcome of the Garda investigation which may result in prosecution, I do not propose to make any further comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>A series of studies on the effects of climate change in Ireland was published by the Department of the Environment in December 1991; copies of the studies are available in the Oireachtas Library.  One of the studies addressed the effects on coastal areas of a rise in sea level along the lines estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  The study concluded that, while Ireland would not be likely to suffer severely from the estimated sea-level rise, there would be increased coastal erosion and flooding in particular areas.

My Department's role is to assist coastal local authorities by facilitating major permanent schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.</P>
    <P>To this end, and with a view to drawing up a national programme of coast protection works for the coming years, my Department during 1991 requested each coastal local authority to submit priorities for coast protection schemes.

      <P>The Culliton report makes a large number of recommendations covering the whole public sector and a wide range <Col N="183" /> of management issues.  The spirit and thrust of Culliton will be brought to bear in all aspects of the development of my Department's role.  The report, however, did make a number of major specific recommendations relevant to the Department of the Marine in particular in relation to ports and the food sector as far as fish is concerned.</P>
      <P>The report recommended major changes in the institutional framework and ownership of ports.  On the basis of that report and the main recommendations of the Review Group on Commercial Harbours and Pilotage Policy and Legislation, the Government have given approval to the drafting of a new Bill to re-organise the management of commercial ports.  The new legislation will set up commercial State companies to manage a total of 12 ports, provide for the re-organisation of port pilotage services, transfer responsibility for harbours of lesser commercial significance to the local authorities and designate Dingle Harbour as a Fishery Harbour Centre.</P>
      <P>The detailed recommendations of Culliton in the food sector are the subject of a full examination by an interdepartmental committee, which will report before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Cork Dockyard was purchased by Damen Shipyards in 1990.  The level of employment at the yard depends on the volume of work on hand.  Throughout Western Europe demand for shipbuilding and ship repair has been weak for some time due primarily to the downturn in world economic performance.</P>

    <P>Damen is confident that when an upturn in demand for repair and ship construction occurs, Cork Dockyard will be well placed to expand its operations and employment.

      <P>There are two legal aid schemes which are funded by my Department.  The first, the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice, is a contributory scheme administered by the Legal Aid Board.  The other, the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme which is administered by the Courts, is free.  I <Col N="186" /> am presuming that the Deputy's question refers to the latter.</P>
      <P>Costs associated with the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme are made up of (i) payment of fees and expenses to the private lawyers (Counsel and Solicitors) who operate the scheme, which came to £2,788,346, £2,689,520 and £3,153,000, in each of the years 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively, and (ii) administration costs.  It would not be possible to put a value on the costs associated with the administration of the scheme without a disproportionate amount of staff time being allocated to the task.  However, these costs would not be of significant proportions.</P>
      <P>Also, there is an arrangement known as the Attorney General's Scheme under which certain legal costs of members of the public are paid by the Attorney General's Office in bail applications, <i>habeas corpus</i> and other State side matters where the High Court so recommends.  I am advised by the Attorney General's Office that expenditure incurred in each of the years 1989, 1990 and 1991 under the Attorney General's scheme was £66,237, £126,683 and £84,433, respectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a paper read to the Conference of the European Forum of Victim Services on 22 May 1992.  In this paper the person concerned, rather than suggesting, as the question implies, that crime in Ireland was steadily increasing, sought to counter an overstated view of the extent of crime in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He pointed to the fact that offences against the person had decreased from 1981 to 1990 by 34 per cent.  The Commissioner's recently published Annual <Col N="187" /> Report on Crime in fact shows a further decrease in 1991 of 12 per cent in this category of crime by comparison with 1990.</P>
    <P>He also examined Irish crime rates in an international context and concluded that Ireland had the lowest number of homicides of the 12 EC countries, that our burglary rate compares favourably, being less than half the rate experienced in Germany and Denmark and less than one third the rate in the Netherlands.  He also pointed out that all EC countries with the exception of Spain and Germany have experienced an increase in crime over the five year period 1986 to 1990 but that the increase in Ireland in that period at 1 per cent was the lowest in a range of increases from 1 per cent to 38 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, to explain why there should be a perception that crime in Ireland is spiralling when this is not supported by the evidence, he concludes that this perception may be caused by an increase in the use of what he terms &ldquo;gratuitous violence&rdquo; in the course of what would otherwise be petty stealing.  He points out that the incidence of this type of violence is small, being only 3 per cent of all cases of stealing.  He attributes this increase most significantly to increasing crude behaviour by some members of the public which eventually manifests itself in criminal activity as violent crime.</P>
    <P>I agree with the major argument of the paper &mdash; that the crime problem can at times be overstated.  Indeed I am concerned that such overstatement can serve only to unduly frighten vulnerable members of society.  However, I also share the disquiet which was expressed at the increase in violence in what would otherwise be petty stealing.</P>
    <P>This paper highlighted the advantages of community-based crime prevention programmes in encouraging the community to work with the police and to improve the quality and safety of their own lives.  I believe that these programmes have a very important part to play in promoting and maintaining traditional values of decency and good behaviour as well as in helping to prevent crime <Col N="188" /> including the type of violence referred to.  I intend to continue to give such programmes my fullest support.  I also believe that many other recent developments will make a vital contribution to the fight against crime and will serve to keep our country as free from crime as modern society allows.</P>
    <P>These developments include the present Garda recruitment campaign which will bring the strength of the Garda Síochána at the end of this year to almost 11,000; the new rural policing arrangements introduced last year at 100 rural Garda stations; the new Crimeline programme representing a new approach in the Garda process of solving crime; the establishment of the interdepartmental group on urban crime which will shortly make its first report; important initiatives in relation to juvenile offenders &mdash;<i>viz.</i> revamping of the juvenile liaison scheme; special youth projects involving the Garda and Probation and Welfare Service; and new court rules designed to ensure the attendance of the parents or guardians of young offenders at juvenile court hearings; on the legislative side, I am urgently preparing proposals to update the law in relation to certain public order offences and I am also giving priority to a new Juvenile Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>Other important legislative changes in the pipeline include legislation to allow for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime and the proposals in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1992, which was circulated last week, to provide for appeals against unduly lenient sentences, to enable the courts to take account of the effect, and particularly any long term effect, of a violent crime on the victim when the sentence is being imposed and to empower the courts to require those convicted of offences involving violence to pay compensation to the victim for personal injury or loss resulting from the crime.</P>

      <P>I am well aware that the morale of those who have to work in poor accommodation could be adversely affected thereby and for that reason I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to bring all Garda accommodation up to a proper standard. Over £35 million has been spent over the last seven years on the Garda building programme.  In recent months new stations have been provided at Dún Laoghaire, Kells, Charleville and Tipperary. In addition, substantial resources have been directed towards the maintenance of Garda stations.  For example, £2.3 million was spent in this way in 1991 and more than £2 million will be spent this year.  This programme of expenditure has remedied many of the accommodation problems and the areas which still require attention are being addressed as rapidly as possible, having regard to available resources.</P>
      <P>I recently initiated a review of the Garda Building Programme to assess Garda accommodation needs, having regard to changing Garda requirements and to make recommendations as to how these should be met on the most cost effective basis.  This review will help pinpoint the objectives we must set ourselves in relation to Garda accommodation for the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on Free (Criminal) Legal Aid, which had remained virtually static at £2.7 million to £2.8 million per year between 1988 and 1990, rose sharply in 1991 when the outturn was £3.152 million.  The 1992 allocation is £3.87 million and in contemplating what the 1993 requirement will be one must bear in mind the claim for substantial increases <Col N="190" /> in solicitors' legal aid fees being processed by my Department.</P>
      <P>The main determinants of expenditure on criminal legal aid are: (1) the number and the seriousness of criminal cases being prosecuted; (2) decisions by the courts to grant or to withhold the grant of legal aid in individual cases; (3) decisions by the courts as to the number of counsel (up to a maximum of two) to be assigned in each such case, where appropriate; (4) the level of fee paid to prosecution counsel by the Director of Public Prosecutions (there are relationships between the level of fee paid to counsel for the prosecution and that paid to counsel for the defence and to the solicitor acting for the defence in cases heard in the Circuit and Superior Courts); (5) the scale of fees applicable to solicitors for cases heard in the District Court and for appeals to the Circuit Court; and (6) the length of each trial.</P>
      <P>Factors which would have had a significant bearing on the increased expenditure in 1991 would include the substantial increases granted to counsel and to solicitors in 1991 for representing legal aid clients in the Circuit and Superior Courts and to a lesser extent the increase in recorded indictable crime and in the detection rate for 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analysis of the figures of expenditure for 1991 shows that over 96 per cent of expenditure on Criminal Legal Aid related to lawyers' fees, of which more than £1.4 million was in respect of fees to counsel and to solicitors for legal aid work done in the Circuit and Superior Courts.  In recent previous years these fees were increased annually having regard to general wage agreement increases, which were in the region of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent.  However, in the course of 1991 barristers and solicitors acting for the defence both benefited from a 46 per cent (approximate) increase in fees granted to prosecution barristers as a result of negotiations between the Director or Public Prosecutions and the Bar Council which represented the barristers in the negotiations.  This increase was phased and 15 per cent was paid with effect from <Col N="191" /> 1 April 1991 and the balance with effect from 1 October 1991.  This would have had a significant impact on the level of expenditure in that year.  The impact in 1992 will, naturally, be greater because the full 46 per cent increase will apply for the entire year.</P>

I understand from the Garda authorities that they are satisfied with the level of motorised patrols operating in the city and that the overall operational strength in the city is adequate to meet the policing needs of the area.  They continuously monitor manpower levels and other policing arrangements to ensure that the maximum utilisation of resources is achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have introduced a number of measures designed to increase the operational efficiency of the Force to combat crime in Cork city.  One of these measures was the establishment of a uniformed Crime Task Force to respond to areas of high crime incidence. In addition, eight members of the Force in the Division have been released from clerical duties to outdoor police work through the employment of clerical <Col N="201" /> assistance.  The question of further civilianisation is currently under review by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>All person committed to custody who display symptoms of recent narcotic addiction are medically assessed and if it is considered appropriate they are placed on a detoxification programme which may include methadone maintenance. There are approximately 30 such prisoners on methadone maintenance at any one time.  While in prison these prisoners also have available to them a range of medical, psychiatric, psychological and welfare services.  In addition a number of community-based agencies involved with drug addiction problems regularly visit prisons to counsel prisoners.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is small-scale abuse of the drug known as &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; in the Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are, however, very alert to the dangers of this drug and are taking all appropriate measures to counter its use in the Cork area and elsewhere in the country.  These measures include, in particular, the monitoring and surveillance of the acid house party-rave disco scene and other events which attract a teenage following and where substances such as &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; may be available.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as a result of their activities in the Cork area, there were three seizures involving 106 &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; tablets since the drug was first introduced last year and a further four seizures involving 44 tablets are at present being analysed.  I am also informed that prosecutions have <Col N="205" /> been taken or are pending in respect of these seizures.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the problem of &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo; abuse can be dealt with effectively as part of their ongoing strategy for dealing with the drug problem generally in this country.  I would refer the Deputy in this respect to my response to a question which he tabled on 19 February this year on the problem of drug abuse in Cork (Dáil Official Report, volume 415 No. 9. columns 2469 to 2471) in which I gave details of the very extensive Garda response to the drug problem in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>I am of course concerned about the growing drug problem, including the use of &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo;.  In this respect I recently held a conference with senior gardaí on the problem and I have given my full backing to the use of all the resources necessary to combat the scourge of drugs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the distribution of new teaching posts under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in the school-year 1991-92, six special resource teachers were allocated to groups of schools which have handicapped children, including Down's Syndrome children, in ordinary cases.  The role of the resource teacher is to act in support of ordinary teaching staff in addressing the special needs of these children.  It is not at present proposed to assign an additional teacher specifically for the seven pupils referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further development which is currently being pursued and which is of direct relevance to Down's Syndrome children is the expansion of the Visiting Teacher Service.  Already, six additional teachers have been appointed to this service and arrangements are currently being made for a further two appointments. <Col N="211" /> The intention is that these additional teachers together with those of the existing service who currently focus children with visual and hearing impairment, will form the basis for a generic service embracing other clinical groups. Initially, it is intended that the expanded service will embrace children with Down's Syndrome as well as the hearing and visually impaired.</P>
    <P>This expanded service will continue to encompass the necessary level of specialist expertise to enable it to deal successfully with the range of disabilities involved and arrangements for its operation are currently being put in place.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Culliton Committee in relation to education and training were examined thoroughly prior to the finalisation of the Green Paper on Education, including full consultation with the task force overseeing the implementation of the review group's findings.</P>

      <P>The strategy set out in the relevant parts of the Green Paper is fully supported by the task force.  The main elements of this strategy include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development at all levels of the education system of an &ldquo;enterprise ethos&rdquo; in the broad sense of fostering and encouraging a spirit of creativity and innovation among students.</P>
      <P>&mdash;significant structural and curricular initiatives at all levels including a strengthened and expanded vocational orientation in the senior cycle, increased emphasis on language skills, the introduction of a new subject enterprise and technology studies, the further development of schools/industry links and the representation of the business community on boards of management.</P>
      <P>&mdash;a restructuring of post-secondary vocational education and training programmes including the introduction of authoritative, national certification arrangements for all such programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the development at third-level (universities and technological colleges) of explicit policies on interaction with industry and research and development, including more flexibile, modular-based course structures and increased industrial representation on governing bodies.  Already new legislation <Col N="213" /> has been introduced for the technological colleges and legislation will be brought forward for the universities.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development by education providers of ongoing arrangements for the provision of &ldquo;second-chance&rdquo; education and training opportunities and for the continual upgrading of the education and training levels of the existing workforce, in close collaboration with employers.</P>

      <P>There is no public right of way through the school but a pathway has been left open to facilitate local residents who use the grounds for access to the local DART station.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>The appointment of national teachers is a matter for the board of management of the school subject to the approval of both the patron and the Minister.  A candidate must be at least 17 years of age for admission to a college of education for training as a national teacher on the basis of performance at the Leaving Certificate Examination.  Mature candidates must be at least 23 years of age.  A national teacher must retire at the end of the school year in which he/she reaches the age of 65 years.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the selection of staff for appointment in secondary, community and comprehensive schools is a matter for the authorities of individual schools.  My Department does not impose age limits for the purpose of the payment of incremental salary of those teachers except in so far as the compulsory age for retirement is 65 years.</P>
      <P>Memorandum V7 which governs the appointment of teachers throughout the vocational sector including the City of Dublin vocational education committee, specifies age limits for appointment both to permanent wholetime posts and one year temporary posts.  There is provision for me, as Minister, to approve the appointment of a person whose age is outside these limits and as far as I am aware no one is excluded on age grounds alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> In line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> my Department is in the process of amending the regulations to allow the upper age limit to be raised substantially. The provision for exceptions will continue to exist.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to substantially raise recruitment age limits throughout the public sector and to subsequent discussions with managerial and staff interests, the upper age limit for clerical and administrative staff in the vocational education committee second level area was raised to 50 years in September 1991. Vocational education committees were also requested at the same time to review their eligibility requirements for non-officer grades to apply the new age limit of 50 years as a guideline where upper age limits lower than 50 applied.  In the case of community and comprehensive schools, no upper age limit is specified in relation to non-teaching posts.</P>
    <P>My Department has no direct involvement in the employment of non-teaching staff in the voluntary secondary schools. The position in regard to recruitment and promotion within my Department is as follows.  Recruitment to established posts is carried out by the Civil Service Commission in accordance with its standard regulations.  In situations where unestablished posts or temporary posts are filled directly by my Department, age limits are not a factor.  Promotions are made on a merit basis only.</P>

      <P>The total amount paid to Scoil Naomh Bhrighde, Kill, County Kildare, in respect of the school book grant for needy pupils for the 1979-80 school year was £210.  The grant was paid on the basis of the number of pupils in the school the principal considered were in need of assistance which for the year in question was 70 pupils.</P>
      <P>The scheme was administered in the normal manner, through the principal teacher who, subject to the amount of money made available to the school had discretion in the extent of assistance to be given to each pupil and the manner of distributing the funds.  Information as to the means of families assisted would normally be held by the school and is regarded as strictly confidential.</P>

      <P>However, a person who has already pursued a post-graduate course in third level State-funded institution in Ireland is deemed ineligible for the award of a higher education grant to pursue other post-graduate courses on the basis that the State has already subsidised the person to achieve post-graduate qualifications.

A spur off the main route of service was subsequently withdrawn from this area because additional State cost may not be incurred for the transport of ineligible children.</P>
      <P>Accommodation is still available for these pupils on the main route of service to Caherciveen.  The revised pick-up/set-down points are approximately 1 mile from the Killoe-Letter area.  This is considered to be a reasonable standard of service and compares favourably to what is provided for pupils throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I am seeking to actively facilitate the debate in every way open to me.  The &ldquo;Introduction to the Green Paper&rdquo;, containing all the main aims, was published on 21st April, 1992 and was made available extensively to all concerned, including individual teachers and schools.  The full text was published in June and made available immediately to all the major interest groups and published extensively in the national media.</P>
      <P>Immediately following the publication senior officials from my Department invited all the main concerned interests individually to briefing/clarification meetings.  I have taken every possible opportunity to talk with various groups and I have now arranged four major seminars over the next six weeks in Cork, Limerick, Sligo and Athlone to further promote debate and possibly a further one in Dublin in mid-December.  I would also propose, with the agreement of the Whips, to have a full debate on the Green Paper in both Houses later in the month.</P>

    <P>I am aware of concerns about an overly tight time frame.  I fully recognise the importance of debate and consultation.

I believe we are allowed good time for, and facilitating in every way possible, substantive debate as a basis for such action. Therefore I wish to confirm that I will ensure that adequate time is made available to all parties to submit their views and that they are fully consulted in advance of the writing of the White Paper.</P>

      <P>The Vocational Education Opportunity Scheme is a specific scheme operated by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare and with financial assistance from the European Social Fund, under which long term unemployed persons can take part in full-time second-level vocational education and training without losing their Social Welfare entitlements. Participants are removed from the Live Register but receive an allowance from my Department in lieu of the social welfare payments they would be entitled to.  Additional grants are paid towards travel, meals, books etc.</P>
      <P>As the number of places available on the scheme has been limited, it has not been possible to accommodate all those who would wish to participate.  The number of places was increased to 1,060 places in 1991/92.  An additional 1,000 places will be available by the end of 1992 and consideration is being given to the further substantial expansion of the scheme.</P>
      <P>For those who cannot be accommodated within the expanding VTOS, separate arrangements are operated by the Department of Social Welfare under which long term unemployed may continue to receive their social welfare payments while engaged full-time in education at either second or third-level. The additional grant assistance does not apply under these schemes.</P>

      <P>Oberstown Boys' Centre was opened in September 1991 and currently has authority to hold 10 boys on remand and a further 20 boys on long term detention. The Centre offers a less restrictive regime for those young offenders for whom the more secure arrangements of Trinity House are not considered necessary or appropriate.  It is important that this varied level of response be available to meet the particular needs of the boys involved and in keeping with this approach it is not intended, nor was it ever promised, that a security fence be erected around the facility.  Where a boy proves to require secure provision, arrangements are made for transfer to Trinity House.</P>

      <P>The first report of the task force noted that my Department's policy has been and continues to be in line with the Culliton recommendation that the Government continue to press for the further deregulation of European aviation including air freight services.  The measures adopted at the recent EC Transport Council come into effect from 1 January 1993 and will give air carriers greater freedom as to capacity, pricing and market access, effectively creating a Single EC Market in air transport.  The criteria for the licensing of air carriers have also been harmonised.</P>
      <P>The Culliton Report also made recommendations in relation to postal services and telecommunications services and both these areas are due to be dealt with in the second report of the task force which will be submitted to Government shortly.  Accordingly it would not be appropriate for me to comment further pending the Government's consideration of the task force's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249, 250 and 252 together.  I refer the Deputy to my answer to a Question No. 196 on this subject on 23 June 1992, columns 719-720, volume 421, No. 4, of the Official Report for that day in which Government policy on the operation of illegal deflector systems is clearly set down.  It has also been explained in answer to Parliamentary Questions on 18 May, 1992 &mdash; volume 380, column 1791 and 1792 of the Official Report for that day refers &mdash; why UHF deflector systems, for practical and policy reasons, cannot be licensed and therefore do not and never have constituted an acceptable alternative means of providing a multichannel television service on a nationwide basis to areas which are not cabled.</P>
      <P>For the sake of completeness, I refer the Deputy to the Official Reports of Question Time during 1985 and 1986, in particular Question Number 5 of 2 July 1985 columns 13 to 15 of the Official Report for that day and Question No. 36 of 20 February, 1986, columns 3485 and 3486 of the Official Report for that day for the policy of the Government, of which Deputy Barry was a member, on this issue in general and the illegal system in Carrigaline in particular, even before the Government considered the use of MMDS as a legal alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy has been clear, under successive Governments, for a considerable time &mdash; rebroadcasting systems such as that operating in Carrigaline cannot in the national interest, be licensed.  In regard to the continued operation of illegal system, it has been the policy that the illegal systems must close down as legal alternatives &mdash; cable and MMDS &mdash; become available.  There have been allegations that Cork has been singled out in some way in the operation of this policy.  I do not accept such allegations. The action taken by my Department in Carrigaline is part of an ongoing process of upholding the law.  Since the introduction <Col N="241" /> of MMDS, illegal systems in other parts of the country have closed down on foot of warnings issued by the Department (such as were issued in Cork) or of their own volition.  Where such warnings are not heeded, there is no alternative but to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>The efficient use of the radio frequencies available for MMDS dictated that licences had to be exclusive in each particular area if we are to bring a credible range of programmes service to people on a nationwide basis.  Licences were issued only after a competitive tendering process which was extensively advertised and which was open to any interested party.  The company referred to by the Deputy did not make an application for the MMDS franchise in County Cork.</P>
    <P>The reasons why applications for licences for systems such as the Carrigaline systems could not be approved were explained on a number of occasions to those associated with its operation. These reasons were once again explained in detail in writing to the operators of the Carrigaline system last July in response to an application for a licence.</P>

      <P>The company referred to by the Deputy was issued with a cable television licence for Cork city and its environs with effect from February 1982.  The licence was amended with effect from March 1985 to include Carrigaline.  The MMDS franchise for County Cork and west Waterford was issued to the company in October, 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of a contract to supply multichannel television&mdash;cable and MMDS &mdash;are a matter between the subscriber and the licensed company and nothing in <Col N="242" /> the licence obliges a licensee to offer a service to all houses in the area on the same terms.  However, cable television operators must have the consent of the Minister for their charges for the basic service supplied.</P>
    <P>MMDS charges are a matter for MMDS operators primarily and they do not need Ministerial approval.  However, under the relevant regulations the Minister has power to investigate the charges being applied by any operator and, if considered warranted, subject to independent arbitration if sought by the operator concerned, direct that an operators charges be altered.</P>

      <P>The specialist counselling services for perpetrators of child sex abuse which are available at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum have been developed as part of a National Forensic Service by the Eastern Health Board.  The programme which has been developed at the hospital helps the offender examine their offending behaviour and how not to re-offend.</P>
      <P>Since the programme was initiated approximately half of those referred have refused treatment.  The programme is designed to counsel those who voluntarily opt to participate following referral to the service.  Many alleged perpetrators of child sex abuse do not admit to offending behaviour and are therefore not willing to participate in the programme. Those who initially refuse treatment are given the option of joining the treatment programme at a later stage.</P>

    <P>There has been a significant improvement in the level of orthodontic services in the Wexford area as a result of the additional moneys made available by the Government since 1990.

    <P>A number of services previously delivered through the psychiatric programme have been transferred to other programmes in the period referred to.  Persons with mental handicap have been transferred from psychiatric hospitals to mental handicap centres under the community care or mental handicap services. Many elderly patients have been transferred from psychiatric hospitals to more suitable accommodation in homes for the elderly.  A number of acute psychiatric units have opened in general hospitals to replace admission facilities in the psychiatric hospitals.  In all cases, the level of expenditure on those services has been maintained, and indeed enhanced, through transfer of resources to the new programmes.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the tables below.  A detailed breakdown by age group of the number <Col N="258" /> of in-patients in each health board psychiatric hospital and unit at 31 March 1991 is contained in <i>The Irish Psychiatric Hospitals and Units Census 1991,</i> carried out by the Health Research Board.  Table 1 presents this data.  The total number of in-patients at 31 December, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1990 for each psychiatric hospital and unit is provided in Table 2. Table 3 details the wholetime equivalent number of psychiatric nurses employed in each health board at 31 December, 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1991.  These figures are not available for earlier years.  The number of total attendances at psychiatric clinics in each health board for the years 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1990 is shown in Table 4.  These figures are not available for earlier years.  I will communicate with the Deputy as soon as the 1991 figures are available.</P>

      <P>I understand that following a lengthy series of correspondence and discussions between the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and St. Francis Medical Centre, Ballinderry, Mullingar the board felt obliged to discontinue insurance cover on 1 December 1991 in respect of services provided at the centre.</P>
      <P>High Court proceedings were instituted against the Voluntary Health Insurance Board by the trustees of the congregation of Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady, being the owners of St. Francis Medical Centre.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I do not have any statutory responsibility in relation to St. Francis Medical Centre, as it is a private institution.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the largest percentage increase in HIV and AIDS infection between June, 1991 and June, 1992 was among heterosexuals; the steps he has taken to combat this increase in infection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 14 June, 1991 and 21 June, 1992 the number of heterosexuals with AIDS increased from 15 to 25, an increase of 66.6 per cent.  The rate of increase in all AIDS cases was 36 per cent.  In the period 30 June 1991 to 30 June, 1992 there was an increase in the &ldquo;Heterosexual/ Unspecified&rdquo; category of HIV Tests from 110 to 151, an increase of 37.3 per cent. The overall rate of increase in respect of HIV was 12.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>The number of AIDS cases is of course a reflection of the number of HIV infected persons in the community who may have been infected for some considerable time but who did not develop full AIDS until the period in question.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health I have identified the HIV/AIDS problem as a priority area for action.  I have accepted the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee and have begun a comprehensive programme to implement these as quickly as possible.  This has included making available substantial resources to ensure that the most important recommendations were implemented this year.</P>
      <P>The National AIDS Strategy Committee recognised that in the absence of a cure for the disease or a vaccine against infection, preventive measures must remain at the forefront of government policy.  To this end I have ensured:</P>
      <P>(a)  the widespread distribution of the Health Promotion Unit's leaflet &ldquo;AIDS &mdash; The Facts&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>(b)  the preparation of a series of radio advertisements centered on Irish AIDS Day.  My Department are also considering the development of a mass-media campaign in time for World AIDS Day;</P>
      <P>(c)  the withdrawal of restrictions on the availability of condoms, which are widely recommended as a means of halting the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> (d)  that General Practitioner staffed community clinics have been opened in two locations in Dublin city.  These will be open to anyone concerned about HIV/AIDS and will obviously have a particular role to play in combating the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus amongst the drug abusing population.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the general public, as a result of the various media campaigns which my Department has conducted, together with the widespread dissemination of information leaflets, are aware of HIV/AIDS and how it is transmitted. I am further satisfied that the other measures I have taken including the liberalisation of the law regarding the availability of condoms will help to halt the spread of infection.</P>

    <P>I propose to commence some further provisions of the legislation before the end of the year, in particular section 7 which will require each health board to establish a child care advisory committee to advise it on the performance of its functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million was set aside in the budget of 1991 to fund essential developments preparatory to the implementation of the legislation.  The full year costs of the new developments approved during 1991 is £3 million and full provision for this has been included in the 1992 Health Vote.  A special allocation of £2 million was set aside in this year's budget to fund further new developments in child care.  This brings the Government's investment in the Act this year to almost £5 million.  These moneys are enabling the health boards, in association with the voluntary sector, to develop a comprehensive range of child care and family support services in accordance with the requirements of the legislation and to recruit the additional child care specialists and other staff needed to operate the new services.  The Government are committed to providing the additional resources needed to bring the Act fully into operation on a phased basis in accordance with the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>The drugs refund scheme is intended to provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons who do not have entitlement to free drugs under the general medical services medical card scheme.  The refund scheme currently operates on the basis that any expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £90 per calendar quarter will be refunded.</P>
      <P>With regard to the position referred to by the Deputy, the Mid-Western Health Board administers the scheme in the same way as all the other health boards and as set out in the appropriate regulations and it is not intended to change the basis of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that persons who have been certified to be in need of continuing medication can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  Persons covered by this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 per month at their pharmacy, <Col N="273" /> as the balance of their expenditure will be claimed directly by the pharmacist from the GMS (Payments) Board.  Over 20,000 people are currently availing of this scheme.</P>

      <P>There is available at present a range of treatment and rehabilitation services provided by statutory and voluntary agencies, such as:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Regional Health Boards</P>
      <P>&mdash;The Drug Treatment Centre, Trinity Court</P>

      <P>&mdash;Individual G.P. Services.</P>
      <P>These services are not aimed exclusively at narcotic addicts but cater for a broad range of drug addictions.  This approach is in line with Government policy which accepts that there must be a multiplicity of treatment approaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is at present no reliable estimate of the number of intravenous drug abusers in the country.  Measures are being taken to remedy this situation through the development of a national data base on drug misuse.  In the meantime it is not possible to say what proportion of narcotic addicts are taking part in methadone <Col N="274" /> maintenance programmes. However, at present approximately 150 individuals are taking part in methadone maintenance programmes at the Drug Treatment Centre while the Eastern Health Board is catering for approximately 160 individuals on its maintenance programmes.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy on the treatment of narcotic addicts is laid out in the Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse and the care and treatment of HIV/AIDS infected drug abusers is also addressed in the report of the National AIDS Strategy Committee and as such are too extensive to quote in reply.  I have arranged to have a copy of both documents forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>There are a number of measures both new and ongoing which are in place to combat drug abuse.  These include:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of a national drug misuse data base;</P>
    <P>&mdash;approved co-ordination and dialogue between the statutory and voluntary services at local level;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of community drug teams in targeted areas;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a strengthening of the role of the Drug Treatment Centre and an expansion of board membership;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the development of general practitioner staffed community based clinics (satellite clinics) which cater for HIV/AIDS infected drug abusers.</P>
    <P>At present there are two satellite clinics in operation, one at Baggot Street and the other at Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot, and it is proposed to open at least one more, on the northside of Dublin city, and in areas of greatest need.  The Southern Health Board are at present evaluating the need for such a clinic(s) in their catchment area.</P>
    <P>The total cost for the current year of the two clinics in operation to date is £315,000.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a submission from the Association of AMI Montessori Teachers of Ireland about the impact of Part VII the Child Care Act, 1991 on the operation of montessori schools.  Representatives of the association have also had discussions with my colleague Deputy Chris Flood, Minister of State to express their concerns about the possible introduction of child/staff ratios.</P>
      <P>Part VII of the Act contains important new provisions for the supervision and inspection of services for pre-school children. The Act defines &ldquo;pre-school child&rdquo; as a child under the age of six years who is not attending national school or a school providing an educational programme similar to a national school.  The Act empowers me, following consultation with my colleagues, the Ministers for Education and the Environment to make regulations governing the operation of pre-school services.  The association is seeking an exemption from the requirements of the regulations on the ground that Montessori schools are providing an educational programme similar to a national school.  This is an issue that will be addressed in the preparation of the regulations, and I shall be guided by the advice of my colleague, the Minister for Education, on the extent to which montessori schools should be exempted.</P>

      <P>As part of its normal seasonal bed closures, the Mid-Western Health Board reduced the bed numbers in Ennis General Hospital to 68 in-patient and six day beds.  Bed closures are a feature of hospital bed management and are planned to coincide with periods where there is least demand for beds and when staff are on holidays.  The situation is being reviewed by the health board in relation to the re-opening of the closed ward at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>A relatively small number of patients from the Ennis catchment area have been admitted to the Limerick Regional Hospital in cases where they could not be accommodated in Ennis General Hospital.  Some of these, I am informed, would have required admission to Limerick Regional Hospital in any event.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to avoid the mixing of patients, except in the geriatric ward (which was designed to accommodate male and female patients) and the intensive care unit in Ennis General Hospital.</P>

      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that I met representatives of St. Joseph's Association for the Mentally Handicapped on 5 August 1992 at which the needs of people with a mental handicap resident in St. Joseph's Service, St. Ita's Hospital were discussed.</P>
      <P>I must point out that the funding of St. Ita's Hospital is a matter, in the first instance, for the Eastern Health Board. The board is of the view that the large institutional buildings on the campus of St. Ita's Hospital are unsuitable to accommodate people with a mental handicap.  In 1991 two of the former staff houses on the campus were converted into hostels for clients of the service which facilitated the closure of one of the main institutional units.  The Eastern Health Board intends to open a further 23 places in three other group homes on the campus in the next few weeks.  This will facilitate the closure of a further institutional unit.  The board plans to continue this process of transfer from the institutional accommodation.  Before any client is transferred, his or her individual needs are assessed, and an individual programme plan agreed.  Parents are actively involved in the transfer and the preparation of programme plans.  The board has also embarked on the provision of a comprehensive range of community services in North County Dublin with the initial aim of preventing inappropriate new admissions of people with mental handicap to St. Ita's Hospital.  A capital allocation of £200,000 has been made available to the board this year, from the additional funds for the development of mental handicap services, towards the provision of these community services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board Planning Committee plan for the development of mental handicap services under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes the development of services in St. Ita's Hospital.  In addition <Col N="279" /> the board is in the process of preparing a detailed five year plan for St. Joseph's Services.  Further developments in the provision of services will depend on the funding made available to me in 1993 and future years for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the Eastern Health Board's planning committee on mental handicap services is representative of the service providing agencies in the region and is chaired by the programme manager responsible for the mental handicap services.  The board's co-ordinator of mental handicap services attends all of the meetings and represents the board's services.  I have requested that each health board include a representative of the parents of people with a mental handicap, nominated by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, on each mental handicap planning committee.</P>

      <P>In addition a programme has now been developed in Arbour House Treatment Centre to provide a comprehensive alcohol and drug treatment service for teenagers and young adults on an out-patient basis during a three year pilot study.

      <P>This is the first operational year of the juvenile programme, but the results are encouraging.  A unique feature of the programme is the priority which is being given to the participation of parents and school teachers in reference to treatment through early intervention in the childrens homes and in the schools.  Special evening training programmes have been developed at Arbour House for parents and teachers which provide them with identification and intervention skills so that parents and teachers will be well equipped to suspect that teenagers either in school or at home have become involved in alcohol and drug abuse. Those participating in these programmes are also trained to co-operate with the staff of Arbour House in getting such young people into Arbour House for diagnosis and treatment at the ealiest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department introduced a new immunisation programme with effect from 1 October 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new immunisation programme against Haemophilus Influenza Type B &mdash; or Hib as it is commonly called &mdash; is designed to offer protection to infants from the age of two months against Bacterial <Col N="282" /> Meningitis, which is one of the severest of the communicable diseases in young children.</P>
    <P>On the recommendation of the National Drugs Advisory Board, the vaccine will be offered at the ages of two, four and six months, and I have advised the health boards to commence, a new integrated schedule of primary childhood immunisation, with the Hib vaccine to be administered with DPT and Polio at age two and four months and on its own at age six months.</P>
    <P>In addition, for a limited period, children over 13 months up to four years of age will be offered one dose of the vaccine. This is designed to protect children in the age group in which about 90 per cent of cases of Hib-related Bacterial Meningitis occur.</P>
    <P>The new programme is being introduced in Ireland against a background of a continuing high level of bacterial meningitis.  About 185 cases of this disease have been reported this year to date. About half of the cases of bacterial meningitis are normally caused by Hib Meningitis. This particular infection has a mortality rate of about 5 per cent and may cause permanent damage to the central nervous system in about 10 per cent of persons who survive the acute infection.</P>
    <P>I feel that it is important for me to stress, however, that not all of the cases of bacterial meningitis which occur are caused by Haemophilus Influenza Type B.  Other causes of bacterial meningitis are meningococial meningitis and pneumocal meningitis but infections due to Hib are a significant cause of bacterial meningitis in children aged under four years.  Hence it was imperative that we introduce this vaccine into this country at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The epidemiology of Hib infection in Western Europe and the USA, as described in large incidence studies in those countries, indicates that one in 600 children develops some form of Hib disease before their fifth birthday.  As I mentioned, the most significant Hib disease is Meningitis and paediatricians and epidemiologists consider that the prevalence of Hib here is similar to that in other <Col N="283" /> countries.  Therefore, if we eradicate Hib Meningitis, we can hope to half the incidence of Bacterial Meningitis in this country. While the major benefit arising from this would obviously be a significant improvement in child health.  Clearly, this would also be of considerable importance in economic terms in savings to the health services relating to the treatment and care of persons who suffer from the disease, both in the short and longer terms.  It is estimated that about 10 per cent of persons who survive the disease suffer permanent neurological damage, such as deafness and mental handicap.</P>
    <P>The vaccine being used in our programme has been shown to give very good protection against the disease.  Over 20 million doses of this vaccine have been used worldwide and no serious adverse reaction have been reported.  While it only prevents that form of Bacterial Meningitis which is caused by Hib, in countries where it has been used &mdash; such as Finland and Iceland &mdash; they have practically eradicated Hib Disease in young children.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, the vaccine will be given in the routine childhood immunisation schedule and this is to ensure that babies are protected before 11 months of age which is the period of greatest risk of contracting the disease.</P>
    <P>The programme is being promoted by the Department and the health boards and towards this end, the health promotion unit has prepared two leaflets aimed at parents and health professionals. 200,000 copies of the leaflet for parents and 5,000 copies of the one for health professionals are being circulated through maternity hospitals, health centres, general practitioners, pharmacies and the health promotion unit itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 and 309 together.  Since hazardous waste management planning and control are statutorily devolved to the major local authorities, the Department of the Environment does not have the detailed information sought in Question No. 309.  A considerable amount of information relating to local authority and private waste disposal operations is however contained in the National Data Base on Waste (1986), a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.  Work on updating this data base is in hands.  An underlying principle of hazardous waste management, as set out in the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982 and the associated Departmental guidelines is that such wastes must be disposed of without endangering human health or harming the environment.  A range of controls, including environmental monitoring, operate in support of this objective.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive new legislation on waste is at an advanced stage of preparation in the Department, following a consultative seminar held in July, 1992 to obtain views from a wide range of interested organisations and persons.</P>

      <P>The melting of the ice cap would have implications for biodiversity in the Artic region itself and in more southerly latitudes. It would also reinforce the rise in sea level which would be expected from the thermal expansion of the oceans and the melting of the temperate glaciers arising from climate change.</P>
      <P>The possible effects of climate change generally are being addressed at EC and wider international level and Ireland is fully participating in the development of appropriate response measures.  A series of studies on the effects of climate change in Ireland itself was published by my Department in December 1991; copies are available in the Oireachtas Library. The conclusions of the studies will be taken into account by interested Departments.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group cover a broad spectrum of policies directly or indirectly related to industrial policy and many of them, therefore, relate to a number of Government Departments.  In so far as specific individual recommendations fall mainly within the purview of my Department, the position is as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Recommendation</i>
      </P>
      <P>Recourse to the courts in planning cases should be by way of judicial review.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, enacted in July 1992, provides for this.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Recommendation</i>
      </P>
      <P>Provision should be made for adequate co-ordination and integration between the licensing procedures under the proposed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the planning process to avoid confusion and the timing of decisions under any separate procedures should be dovetailed.</P>
      <P>Amendments were made to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, during its passage through the Oireachtas so as to make the Agency the sole authority for considering the environmental pollution aspects of those classes of activity for which a licence is required from the agency.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Recommendation</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should make a definite decision on providing for the <Col N="290" /> safe disposal of hazardous industrial waste.</P>
    <P>Securing the provision of a central hazardous waste incinerator by Irish industry has been a standing policy objective.  Following the decision of Du Pont (UK) not to proceed with their proposal for such an incinerator in Derry, hazardous waste disposal requirements are being actively reviewed in the light of factors such as emerging higher technical standards, changed market conditions and possible new incineration requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Maintain the increased investment momentum on road improvements, concentrating on the roads that give the highest economic return per pound spent.</P>
    <P>This recommendation and the associated comment broadly supports existing road development strategy as set out in the Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989-'93.  It will be taken fully into account in framing the programme of road improvements for the period after 1993.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent outbreaks of violence in the Assiut Province of Egypt which have claimed a number of lives, including those of members of the Coptic Christian community &mdash; a long-established and significant minority in Egypt.  Responsibility for the violence <Col N="314" /> has been attributed to extreme Islamic fundamentalists in the region.  The Egyptian Government has responded to these events and to other acts of violence by strengthening the country's anti-terrorist legislation.  The Government there is faced with the task of combating terrorist violence while seeking to uphold human rights.</P>
      <P>The situation is reviewed as necessary within the framework of European Political Co-operation and we will continue to keep in touch with the situation through our participation in that process as well as through reports from our embassy in Cairo.</P>

      <P>Ireland, together with our partners in the Twelve, has expressed its deep concern on a number of occasions over the past year about the situation in East Timor, and in particular about the question of human rights abuses there.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with the Indonesian Ambassador to Ireland earlier this year I expressed my deep concern about human rights in East Timor.  I recently met in Dublin Mr. Jose Ramos-Horta, a spokesman for the people of East Timor, and conveyed to him my deep sympathy at the plight of his people and my outrage at the human rights abuses being perpetrated by the Indonesian armed forces in East Timor.</P>

When the validation process is completed the panel will commence its analysis of the results. After its assessment, the panel will make recommendations to the Department as to the new areas to be classified.  When the Department has examined the panel's recommendations I will seek Government approval to submit to the EC a formal request to extend the present disadvantaged areas in Ireland.  The EC <Col N="320" /> Commission will in turn scrutinise the submission in detail and if satisfied prepare a proposal listing the townlands to be classified as disadvantaged for approval by the EC Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  When approved the list will be published by the Commission.</P>

      <P>The level of the estimated ewe premium for 1992 on which the first advance of the 1992 premium was based, was calculated by the EC Commission last June.  A method based on a single <Col N="321" /> average price for the EC as a whole, used then for the first time, led to a reduction of £1.76 in the first advance of the ewe premium; this was compensated, in the case of producers in disadvantaged areas, by an increase of £1.31 in the rural world premium.  The method of calculation is in accordance with the agreement reached by the Council of Ministers in 1989 on the reform of the sheepmeat regime.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the 1992 premium foreshadowed by the first advance is occurring at a time when market prices are falling in a way which points to the fact that the price adjustment expected at the time of the 1989 reform has not materialised.  Ireland has been warning the Council and Commission for some time that this was likely.  When our fears in this regard were borne out I immediately submitted a case to the EC Commission for an increase in the ewe premium because of the special circumstances obtaining in Ireland.  I have discussed this case with the Commissioner on a number of occasions and impressed on him the importance of a positive response from the Commission. I expect that the second advance of the estimated 1992 premium will be calculated by the Commission later this month and the final 1992 premium will be fixed in March 1993.  Until such time as the Commission has completed its examination of Ireland's case, I am not in a position to anticipate the level of the premium for 1992 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for the import into the Community of sheepmeat are governed by the terms of a Voluntary Restraint Agreement (VRA) concluded with New Zealand.  Under the VRA, New Zealand can supply up to 205,000 tonnes per year to the Community which is now about 85 per cent self sufficient in the sheep and lamb sector.  The VRA was last reviewed in 1989 and terminates at the end of this year.  In the absence of the VRA, imports without any quantitative restriction can take place provided an import duty at the rate of 10 per cent is paid.</P>
      <P>As the arrangements to apply to imports of sheepmeat from New Zealand after 1992 are a matter for negotiation, it would not be appropriate to indicate Ireland's position in this regard. However, I can assure the House that the protection of Irish sheepmeat producers particularly in the light of the difficulties at present facing them, will be my prime concern in these negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board, which administers the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the Dublin area on behalf of my Department, has been contacted with regard to this particular case.  It is understood that the board has been actively involved in assisting the person in question with her serious financial difficulties which were brought to the attention of the board by a member of her family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board came to an arrangement with the person in question and agreed to assist her with her financial difficulties, subject to the claimant also making a contribution towards clearing her debts. This arrangement is being reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the conditions <Col N="329" /> of the agreement are being adhered to.</P>
    <P>Under the differential rent scheme there is provision for Local Authorities to reassess rent in hardship cases. Accordingly, it is not the practice of Health Boards to pay rent supplements to persons on differential rents or to assist with arrears</P>
    <P>I have been particularly concerned for some time about the problems of moneylending. The 1992 budget provided for a special allocation of £260,000 for the establishment of pilot projects around the country, aimed at building new and more comprehensive approaches to combating the problems of moneylending.  I have recently launched five projects which are being set up in Dublin City West, West Clare, Cork City, Limerick City and Waterford City.</P>
    <P>Under this new scheme local groups who have already been involved in this work will expand their efforts and try out a variety of new and different approaches to tackling the problems of indebtedness among low income families.</P>
    <P>The key elements of the projects include a general money advice element, targeting at families identified as having particular problems with moneylenders, a role for both statutory and voluntary bodies and an emphasis on practical, budget based measures that would have success over the long term in removing people from dependence on moneylenders.</P>
    <P>This initiative follows on the experience of the Loan Guarantee Fund which was set up in 1990.  The Loan Guarantee Fund is operated by the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul on a day to day basis. While the person in question is not within any of the areas covered by the pilot moneylending schemes, she could contact the local Saint Vincent de Paul Conference.</P>
    <P>In 1991 provisions were included in the social welfare legislation to allow for deductions to be made from social welfare payments with the claimant's consent. The amounts deducted could then be paid over to the utilities concerned to <Col N="330" /> assist in meeting bills such as ESB, gas and local authority rent.</P>
    <P>I have asked An Post to develop the household deduction facility as part of the development of their services to social welfare clients and I am happy to say they are well advanced with this project.  They have secured agreement from the utilities and are working closely with my Department on the proposed system.  It is my intention to have this facility available from next January.  It will initially be available on a limited basis in Dublin but the intention is to extend this facility as quickly as possible to all areas of the country.</P>
    <P>The provision of this facility will be a significant element in combating the problems of moneylending.</P>

However, they do not apply in the case of mentally-handicapped persons, persons attending long term rehabilitation courses or certain other disabled or blind persons.</P>
      <P>The reason for the restrictions is because the services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school at that time of the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.</P>

      <P>Health Boards do not maintain statistical records in such a way as to provide the information requested by the Deputy.  However, it is estimated that payments in respect of electricity bills made to the Electricity Supply Board under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme were in the region of £2.5 million in 1989, £2.6 million in 1990 and £3.8 million in 1991.  It is estimated that some 1,500 payments were made on a weekly basis in 1989 and 1990 and approximately 2,300 per week in 1991. Health Boards do not normally help with hire-purchase payments.  However, assistance may be considered where a person who becomes entitled to supplementary welfare allowance has a hire-purchase commitment for an essential item, previously incurred, but is now unable to meet repayments.  Assistance would be given only if there was no immediate prospect of the person's income increasing.  There is no information available on the number of such recipients.</P>

      <P>A bilateral agreement on social security with the United States of America was signed by me on behalf of the Government on 14 April 1992 in Washington.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Constitution the text of this agreement is subject to Dáil approval and I hope to move the necessary motion to seek this approval shortly.  When this has been obtained I can bring the agreement <Col N="334" /> into operation by means of a Ministerial Order.</P>
    <P>However, there are also legal matters which have to be completed on the US side under US social security law.  These require that before a signed agreement can enter into force for the US, the President must transmit it to Congress for a period during which at least one House of the Congress has been in session on each of 60 days.  If this period is not completed during one Congress it must begin over again in a new Congress.  It normally takes 3 to 4 months to prepare the necessary documentation for congressional submission and as a result it will not be possible to clear the required 60 day period during the life of the existing Congress which will expire, because of the Presidential election, on 2nd October next.  It will not be possible, therefore, for the US side to meet this legal requirement until the new Congress meets in January 1993 and the 60 day period will not expire until the end of May 1993.  When it has expired instruments of approval must be exchanged and the agreement will become operative on the first day of the third month following this exchange.  At this stage the likely date for implementation is 1 September 1993.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that in the first full year of operation of the agreement some 1,500 people will receive pensions from the US and Ireland under its provisons and that this number will continue to grow each year after that.  It has also been estimated that some 3,500 persons who are resident in Ireland and receiving US social security pensioners will become entitled to the Free Schemes operated by my Department as soon as the agreement comes into operation.</P>

      <P>Section 4 of the report of the Industrial Review Group puts forward the view that the role of special tax exemptions, reliefs deductions and other tax expenditures should be reduced.  One of the issues raised in this context is the exemption from tax of certain social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>In his 1992 Budget speech the Minister for Finance announced that Disability Benefit and Unemployment Benefit would in future be treated as income for tax purposes.  The operational requirements to give effect to this decision are currently being studied.  The Minister for Finance will through a Commencement Order, set the date (or dates) for implementation of these measures.</P>
      <P>A second concern expressed by the Industrial Review Group was the need the achieve closer integration of the tax and social welfare systems in order to increase the incentive to work.</P>
      <P>This is a very wide-ranging issue concerning not only the way in which PRSI contributions are levied but also the method of paying benefits.  While taxation of short term benefits could be regarded as a first step towards integration of the two systems, further measures will require careful evaluation of their impact on both the insured population and social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, it is my intention that the future development of the social welfare system will place increased emphasis on the need to maintain and enhance the incentive to work.</P>

      <P>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme a weekly supplement can be paid towards mortgage interest payments.  Such supplements may be paid where the interest exceeds £5 per week.</P>
      <P>Section 212 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 permits a Health Board to make a single payment, where it is reasonable to do so, to meet an exceptional need.  Assistance towards the payment of mortgage arrears is, however, not normally given.</P>
      <P>A local authority tenant who has opted to buy his own home under a tenant purchase scheme and falls into an arrears situation would have the option of reverting to tenancy or renegotiating the terms of his agreement with the relevant Local Authority.

    <P>Source: Central Statistics Office, Live Register Statement, 28 August 1992.</P>
    <P>The Department's local offices have responsibility for deciding Unemployment Assistance entitlements, and some of these offices have yet to be computerised. For this reason, comprehensive details of rates of payment are not currently available on a nationwide basis.  However, from some sampling done on claims in payment at computerised offices in March of this year, it would appear that the numbers receiving less than £10 or between £10 and £20 are relatively insignificant.  The sample suggests that about 0.65 per cent of claimants were receiving less than £10 and 1.3 per cent were being paid between £10 and £20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations concerning the different treatment of maintenance payments for tax and PRSI purposes.  For income tax purposes the arrangement which generally applies is that the person paying maintenance payments is allowed a deduction for these payments against his income before tax and the payments are treated as income for tax purposes in the <Col N="339" /> hands of the recipient.  For PRSI purposes, a deduction of maintenance payments in the hands of the payer is not allowed and the payments in the hands of the recipient are liable.  I should point out, however, that PRSI contributions differ from tax in that the payment of social insurance by the recipient allows her to build up entitlement to a Contributory Old Age Pension in her own right.</P>
      <P>I am examining the current arrangements to see what changes, if any, are needed.  It is a complex area, and any changes would have to take account of the need for social insurance cover, the necessity for a reasonable level of contributions to be paid where benefits are given, and equitable treatment of different types of family units.</P>

      <P>The 1992 budget provided for a number of improvements in the schemes administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>These are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Reduction in the age limit for receipt of pre-retirement allowance from 58 to 55 years (28 May 1992).</P>
      <P>&mdash;The free travel &ldquo;companion pass&rdquo; was extended to include blind pensioners, recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) who transfer to old age pension on reaching 66 years, people in residential care previously in receipt of DPMA and non-married couples receiving DPMA (6 April 1992).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;An alternative average test for old age (contributory) pension for claimants with gaps in their insurance <Col N="340" /> records.  Claimants may now qualify for the maximum rate pension if they have a full insurance record since 1979 (6 April 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;The income limits for receipt of Family Income Supplement were raised meaning that most recipients benefit by between £9 and £11 per week (30 July 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Payments under the back to school clothing and footwear scheme increased by £10 per child bringing the new rates to £35 for a child at primary school and to £50 for a child at second level school (1 July 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;A special increase in the adult dependant allowance payable with old age (non-contributory) pension to bring it into line with other adult dependant payments (31 July 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;the &ldquo;Over 80&rdquo; allowance was extended to invalidity pensioners.  (9 April 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;An additional £1 million was provided for this year in grants which are being paid to voluntary organisations, the community development programme and projects to combat the problem of moneylending.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1992, provided for a general increase of 4 per cent in all payments from the end of July this year.  Persons in receipt of the lowest payments received an additional special increase of 2 per cent (31 July 1992).</P>
    <P>This year's Act also provided for certain changes in social welfare schemes as announced on the publication of the 1992 Estimates in December last year.</P>
    <P>These are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The amalgamation of the two maternity allowance schemes into one scheme.  The new scheme covers not only women who are covered by the Maternity Protection of Employees Act but others who are covered by the social insurance system but not by that Act (6 April 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Introduction of an earnings limit for receipt of deserted wife's benefit in <Col N="341" /> respect of new claims only.  Only claimants earning around £12,000 per year are affected (31 August 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Abolition of the requirement to have a Qualification Certificate (statement of means) for receipt of Unemployment Assistance (29 July 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;The linking of applications to unemployment assistance where the applications are separated by a period during which the applicant attends a FÁS course which exceeds 52 weeks (29 July 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;The assessment of earnings from insurable employment in determining entitlement to unemployment assistance (29 July 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Disqualification from receipt of unemployment benefit for up to nine weeks for persons aged under 55 who receive a severance payment in excess of £12,000 (20 July 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Extension of period of disqualification for receipt of unemployment benefit from six to nine weeks in certain circumstances (6 April 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;discontinuance of pay-related benefit in the case of persons whose pattern of work is &ldquo;week on, week off&rdquo; as, at present, for people who work short-time within the same week (6 April 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Amended contribution conditions for receipt of disability and treatment benefit to require a minimum of 13 paid contributions in the governing contribution year or in either of the two previous contribution years or a subsequent year (1 July 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Introduction of an earnings limit for receipt of treatment benefits.  From 6 July 1992, an insured person whose income exceeds £25,000 per annum will not be eligible for dental, optical or aural benefits.  Dependent spouses of such persons will continue to be entitled to full benefits where earnings are greater than £25,000 but do not exceed £50,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" />&mdash;Discontinuance of pay-related benefit with disability benefit for new claims (6 April 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Alignment of the personal rate of injury benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme to the personal rate of disability benefit (6 April 1992).</P>
    <P>&mdash;PRSI earnings ceilings increased to £19,000 and to £20,300 for employee and employer respectively.</P>
    <P>The Act also makes provision for a number of miscellaneous amendments to existing legislation such as the integration of the single woman's allowance scheme with the pre-retirement allowance and the payment of carer's allowance to persons caring for recipients of retirement pension who have transferred from invalidity pension at age 65.</P>
    <P>This year's budget increases in payment rates represent a further step towards achieving the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to meet by 1993 the priority rates set by the Commission on Social Welfare.  All long term social welfare rates either reached or exceeded the priority rates last year.</P>
    <P>The various other changes which I have introduced into the system this year are designed to ensure that social welfare schemes and services are directed more effectively and that available resources are targeted at those who need them most.</P>

      <P>Payment of unemployment assistance to the person concerned was discontinued from 24 June 1992 following a review of his means.  The person's means are derived from self-employment as an electrician, a bed and breakfast business and rents from property.</P>
      <P>He appealed against this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and in accordance with normal procedures the comments of the investigating officer were sought on the issues raised in the appeal.  The assessment was confirmed and the appeal was submitted for consideration by an Appeals Officer on 13 July 1992.  Having considered all the evidence before him the Appeals Officer disallowed the appeal on 18 September 1992.</P>
      <P>Further evidence, in the form of a solicitor's letter, then received was considered by the appeals officer but he did not consider that it affected his decision. The person concerned has been notified of the decision.</P>
      <P>The appeal was processed with all possible speed and it is not considered that there was any excessive delay in deciding the case.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare recipients who have a special dietary requirement <Col N="345" /> arising from a health condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need, may qualify for an additional payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  Entitlement to payment is determined by the relevant Health Board.</P>
      <P>Normally the amount of a payment would reflect the additional cost of the special diet over and above the amount a person would be expected to pay for a normal diet from their basic social welfare payment.  The amount of the supplement would fall to be adjusted following changes in the amount of the basic social welfare payment e.g. through improvements in social welfare payment rates.</P>
      <P>Changes to diet supplements in the past months may have arisen because of such reassessment of income; however, in the absence of specific information on individual cases it is not possible to determine, with certainty, the reasons for the changes referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, with which there are difficulties, I will be glad to ask the Health Board to investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Preservation of Rights) (No. 2) Regulations, 1986 provided for the introduction of transitional payments, with effect from November, 1986.  These transitional payments are introduced so as to avoid a significant reduction in income for married men whose spouses no longer qualified as adult dependants under the revised dependency arrangements introduced at that time.</P>
      <P>Married men who lost the adult dependant increase by virtue of the wife being in receipt of a social welfare payment in her own right received a transitional payment of £20 per week.  Where the wife had income in excess of £50 per week, the husband lost the Adult Dependant Allowance and half of the increases for children.  In these cases, a weekly payment of £10 was made and the full increases for children were restored.</P>
      <P>While the transitional payments were originally intended to last for one year only, they were continued on an annual basis by way of regulations.  From 1988 to 1991 this was done on the basis of a reduction of £2 and £1 respectively in the level of the payments to coincide with budget increases in rates of payment at the end of July each year.</P>
      <P>The dates on which the relevant Regulations were made were as follows:</P>

    <P>The Government decided earlier this <Col N="347" /> year to provide for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay in implementing the 1979 EC Directive, at a cost of £60 million in the period 1992 to 1994.  The transitional payments, which were found by the courts to be in conflict with the principle of equal treatment, had to be discontinued at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Preservation of Rights) (Amendment) Regulations, 1992, (which were made on 25 February, 1992) provided for a continuation of the transitional payments of £12 and £6, as provided for under the Social Welfare (Preservation of Rights) (Amendment) Regulations, 1991, up to week commencing 27 July 1992.  The transitional payments ceased to be paid with effect from that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 6 July 1992 the statutory contribution conditions for entitlement to treatment (dental and optical) benefits have been changed with a view to ensuring the continued viability of the Scheme through better targeting of scarce resources.  In that context, the changes introduced also seek to establish a more realistic relationship between entitlement to benefit and a recent attachment to the workforce through paid PRSI contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the contribution conditions <Col N="348" /> now requires claimants aged 21 years and over to have at least 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year, of which at least 13 must be paid contributions.  However, a claimant who fails to satisfy the 13 paid condition in the governing contribution year can still qualify for benefit if at least 13 contributions were paid in either of the two preceding contribution years or in a subsequent contribution year.</P>
    <P>In practice, this means that a person who ceases to pay PRSI contributions can continue to qualify for treatment benefits for up to five years after leaving the work-force.  After that period, entitlement to benefit will lapse and can only be regained by re-entering insurable employment for at least 13 weeks.</P>
    <P>The requirement to have a minimum of 13 paid contributions in a recent contribution year does not apply in the case of persons who reached pension age prior to 6 July 1992.</P>
    <P>Persons who are not entitled to benefit under the Treatment Benefit Scheme and whose only income is a social welfare payment would be entitled to a medical card for themselves and their dependants. As medical card holders, they would be eligible for dental and optical services under the Health Acts.  The Government has made additional funds available to the Minister for Health over the past few years specifically for the development of dental services and it is understood that this has resulted in a significant improvement in dental services provided by the Health Boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The growth in the number of lone parent households is notable in almost all OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries in recent years, including Ireland.  I am of course aware of this increase and of the situation of lone parents. However it should be noted that significant improvements have been introduced in the social welfare area for this group in recent years.  The Deserted Husband's and Widower's Scheme was introduced in 1989; the Lone Parents Allowance Scheme in October 1990, which streamlined the existing arrangements and extended their scope to include separated persons and unmarried fathers.  The Back-to-School Clothing Allowance introduced in 1990 is also of considerable benefit to this group.</P>
      <P>The priority rates of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare were achieved in 1990 in the case of lone parents and are being maintained in real terms.  As stated in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, the aim is to increase social welfare rates further and progressively, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission, as the resources of the economy grow.</P>
      <P>The means test applied to lone parents is structured to encourage employment with a £6 weekly earnings exemption per child, together with allowances for child minding and travel to work expenses, which allow a single parent the option of supplementing her or his social welfare with part-time earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) provides the long term unemployed, aged 21 or over, with an opportunity to attend education and training courses while continuing to receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments.  A commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides that the range of options, opportunities and incentives to lone parents and other categories, aimed at their return to the workforce, will be improved.  In this context, I will be consulting with my colleague <Col N="350" /> the Minister for Education, regarding the question of the inclusion of lone parents in the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS).</P>
    <P>As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government are committed to an ongoing programme of reform of the social welfare system broadly within the framework outlined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Reports have highlighted the particular problems and requirements of single parent families and the need for a particular focus in meeting their needs.  In that context, resources on a scale necessary to implement the additional child income support measures recommended by the Commission (some £69 million in 1990 terms) will be devoted to child income support in the light of available resources.  The particular measures to be taken will be worked out in the light of up-to-date information on child and family circumstances.  The position of single parent families will be kept under review in this context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of Disability Benefit from 12 December 1985 until 2 October 1992 when payment was disallowed by a Deciding Officer.  This decision followed on an examination on 7 September 1992 by a Medical Referee who expressed the opinion that she was not incapable of work.</P>
      <P>On receipt earlier this week in my Department of a letter from her doctor about her incapacity, her case was reviewed but it was decided that it did not warrant any change to the decision.</P>
      <P>Representations made by the Deputy on 24 September 1992 were accepted as an appeal against the Deciding Officer's decision.  Arising from her appeal arrangements are being made for her to be examined again on 27 October 1992 by another Medical Referee.</P>
      <P>Her entitlement to Disability Benefit and to Invalidity Pension will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of this examination.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1992 provides for the assessment as means for Unemployment Assistance purposes of earnings from insurable employment.  This provision came into effect from 29 July 1992.</P>
      <P>The basis for the change in legislation was firstly, to ensure equity of treatment between employees and self-employed persons claiming Unemployment Assistance. Self-employed claimants have always had their earnings assessed as means.  A person claiming Unemployment Assistance who had part-time or casual employment was not assessed with any income arising from that employment up to this year.  He could work for a few days in a week and qualify for Unemployment Assistance for the remaining days, regardless of earnings for the days worked.  In addition the change takes account of the extension of insurance cover to all employees earnings over £25 per week with resulting wider entitlement to Unemployment Benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to maintain a financial incentive for unemployed people to take up occasional employment where the opportunity arises, a certain amount of earnings is disregarded in assessing a claimant's means.  The amount to be disregarded <Col N="353" /> is the equivalent of the appropriate daily rate of Unemployment Assistance for each day worked plus an additional weekly amount of £10.  For example, a married man with three children working a 3 day week will have £74.50 of his earnings disregarded.  The balance of earnings will then be assessed as means in determining the rate of Unemployment Assistance payable for the days not worked.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the commitment shown by part-time fire fighters in providing a local fire fighting service.  They are on call 24 hours a day and no one can deny the risk factor associated with their work.  However, I would point out that the information available to me shows that earnings for part-time fire fighters can range up to £19,000 a year and under the old arrangements all of this was ignored when calculating their Unemployment Assistance.</P>
    <P>Indeed in the Deputy's own county the average earnings of part-time fire fighters were in the region of £175 per week in the 1990/91 tax year and on top of this they were receiving payment of unemployment assistance.  Clearly such a situation is indefensible.  I cannot allow such a wide difference in treatment between how part-time fire fighters are assessed as against other unemployed.</P>
    <P>In the light of the representations that I have received from many public representatives and in view of the unique nature of their work I will sympathetically reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>The EC Regulations on social security provide that contributions paid in one member state can be combined with contributions paid in other member states in order to qualify a person for certain social security benefits. Accordingly, any contributions paid by the person concerned in the United Kingdom can, subject to certain conditions, be combined with any contributions paid by him in this country.</P>
      <P>Under EC Regulations, responsibility for the payment of disability benefit rests with the country in which the claimant was last insurably employed.  Because of this it is that country which aggregates the contribution records.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned has not made a claim to my Department for disability benefit or invalidity pension, it is not possible, to determine his entitlement to either payment.  If he submits a claim to my Department his entitlement will be examined by a statutorily appointed Deciding Officer.  He will be notified of the outcome and have a right of appeal should he be dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme rests with the Department of Health.  It is understood that the person concerned applied some time ago for this allowance and that a decision on his application is still pending.  Any further inquiries regarding this application should be addressed to the Department of Health. I should mention that entitlement to this payment is based primarily on the applicant's means and as it is a social assistance payment it does not come within the scope of the EC Regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to Council Directive 89/654/EEC of 30 November 1989 concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the workplace (commonly called the Workplace Directive), as published in the Official Journal No. L393 of 30 December 1989 which is due for implementation by member states by 31 December 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is currently developing proposals for Regulations to give effect to that and several other EC Directives.  I understand that the Authority is engaged in widespread consultation and discussions with a range of organisations and bodies in relation to its draft proposals and I expect to receive the Authority's proposals in respect of <Col N="358" /> the &ldquo;Workplace&rdquo; Directive during the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Workplace Directive applies to all workplaces &ldquo;intended to house workstations&rdquo;, i.e. essentially to all buildings where work is carried out.  Therefore workplaces which by their nature are not in buildings (i.e. means of transport used outside the undertaking, workplaces inside means of transport, temporary or mobile worksites, extractive industries, fishing boats, and in agriculture and forestry, fields, woods and other land situated away from the undertaking's buildings) are specifically excluded from the Directive's provisions.  However, further specific Directives are being developed by the EC in respect of those areas.</P>
    <P>The Workplace Directive as adopted by the EC Council is already based on the criteria set down in Article 118A of the EEC Treaty and the Directive states that the obligations laid down in the Annexes to it apply wherever required by the features of the workplace, the activity, the circumstances of a hazard. These are the criteria which will apply in the enforcement of the Directive.</P>
    <P>All workplaces to which the &ldquo;Workplace&rdquo; Directive will apply are already subject to the general duties in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and many of the Directive's requirements are implicitly required under the general provisions of that Act.  In addition, all factory premises which are subject to the provisions of the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, as well as various Regulations made under those Acts, are already expected to comply with a substantial part of the Workplace Directive's requirements.  Furthermore, those provisions of the Directive which relate to the general issue of fire safety are already substantially covered by existing legislation in the fire and building control areas.</P>
    <P>A twofold approach is provided for in the Directive.  As regards workplaces used for the first time after 31 December 1992, and workplaces which undergo modifications, extensions and/or conversions after that date the provisions of <Col N="359" /> Annex I of the Directive are to be applied.  In the case of any workplace already in use before 1 January 1993, the provisions of Annex II of the Directive must be applied at the latest by 1 January 1996.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in developing its proposals for Regulations to give effect to the Directive, the Authority may propose a slightly modified approach to take account of the current situation under our national law.</P>
    <P>As far as the cost of enforcing the Directive's provisions are concerned, it should be noted that many of the requirements are already expected and achieved in workplaces under earlier legislation.</P>
    <P>The preparation and revision as necessary of adequate plans to be followed in emergencies and the provision of such information, instruction, training and supervision of workers as is necessary are already provided for in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, both in terms of the general duties and in the context of the Written Safety Statement required under the Act.  I understand that further elaboration on those requirements is intended in the proposals for Regulations being developed by the Health and Safety Authority to give effect to the &ldquo;New Framework&rdquo; Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work.</P>
    <P>As regards the final part of the question, I would point out that legislative provision already exists under the Fire Services Act, 1981 whereby a person on whom a fire safety notice has been served may appeal to the District Court against it on prescribed grounds.</P>

      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 allows the Minister for Labour to initiate, on behalf of an employee, who so requests it, proceedings for the enforcement of the terms of a determination made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal but not discharged by the employer.  Similar provision is contained in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 and the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981.  The Payment of Wages Act, 1991 specifically provides that an award under the Act may be enforced as if it were an Order of the Circuit Court.  It is my view that these arrangements adequately provide for the enforcement of awards in these areas by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>Generally, recommendations issued by the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts are not legally binding. Section 13 (9) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, which makes provision for an appeal to the Labour Court against a recommendation of a Rights Commissioner, states that &ldquo;... the parties to the dispute shall be bound by the decision of the Court on the appeal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is no enforcement mechanism provided in the 1969 Act and no sanctions are provided where one or other party does not adhere to or implement the decision of the Court under this section. Consideration has been given to the question of introducing an enforcement mechanism but it is likely that such a provision would undermine the voluntary nature of the Rights Commissioner and the Labour Court services.  If measures were introduced to make decisions legally enforceable, it is likely that the parties to disputes would in many cases refuse to use these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, contain provisions for the enforcement of Labour Court determinations in equality cases.  In the context of the current review of this legislation, I am carefully examining the adequacy of the <Col N="361" /> existing enforcement procedures with a view to making improvements in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 and 450 together.</P>
      <P>The Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991, provide that, where an employer fails to pay a statutory redundancy lump sum to an eligible employee, the Minister for Labour is empowered to pay the appropriate entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund; it is not necessary that the employer should be insolvent.  My Department has paid lump sums to the two persons stated to have been paid in the Deputies' questions in accordance with the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts as their employer failed to make the payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Company concerned <Col N="362" /> has not been wound up or liquidated under the Companies Acts but, as I have indicated, this is not a necessary pre-requisite for entitlement by an employee to payment of a redundancy lump sum from the Social Insurance Fund under the Redundancy Payments Acts.</P>
    <P>As regards the other two named persons in the Deputies' questions, the question of payment of their Employment Appeals Tribunal awards would not come within the scope of the Redundancy Payments Acts, as the awards arise from findings of unfair dismissal.  In certain cases, unfair dismissal awards could be payable from the Social Insurance Fund, under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, but the relevant conditions under that Act require that the employer concerned must be insolvent within the definition in section 1 (3) (c) of the Act.  As it appears that the employer in this case does not come within the definition in section 1 (3) (c), the unfair dismissal awards to the two employees cannot be paid under the 1984 Act.  If, however, the company is put into liquidation or receivership, the awards may be payable under the 1984 Act provided the other qualifying conditions are satisfied in individual cases.</P>

In addition, as it is a part-time work scheme participants are free to engage in paid employment when participating in the scheme during the period while they are not actually involved in projects.</P>
      <P>The long term unemployed are a priority group for FÁS training programmes. It is accepted that older long term unemployed with dependants are sometimes reluctant to participate in training.  In order to attempt to overcome this reluctance, a dependency bonus of £10 is payable to trainees in addition to their training allowances which equate to the level of social welfare payments they were receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Incentive Scheme, operated by FÁS, provide an incentive of <Col N="364" /> £60 per week for 39 weeks to an employer who recruits an additional employee from among the long term unemployed. In 1991, 1,700 such persons were recruited under the Scheme.  A similar level of recruitment is expected this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, through its employment service, FÁS provides advice and information relating to opportunities notified to the service.</P>
    <P>An area-based strategy for the long term unemployed was agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Twelve areas have been selected on a pilot basis and the local companies or partnerships have drawn up Area Action Plans based on the needs of the areas.</P>
    <P>On 30 April last, the Taoiseach announced a number of special measures to be taken in the 12 pilot areas aimed at helping the long term unemployed get back to work.  The measures, which will be operated through the partnerships in association with the appropriate Government Departments, focus on eliminating difficulties faced by people who are long term unemployed when the possibility of taking up either paid employment and/or training and development schemes present themselves.  In particular, long term unemployed people, approved by the partnerships, taking up paid employment or becoming self-employed will retain their existing secondary benefits for a period of 12 months.  In the case of those becoming self-employed, they will be paid an allowance equivalent to the social welfare payments to which they were entitled while on the Live Register.</P>
    <P>Following evaluation, the area-based initiative may be extended nationwide as resources permit.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the administration and <Col N="365" /> enforcement of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 rests with the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health which was established under that Act.  Among the Authority's functions is that of keeping the relevant statutory provisions under review.  I receive regular updates from the Authority on its programme of work and objectives.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in the first three years of the Authority's existence in developing an awareness of the requirements of the 1989 Act both in areas traditionally covered by safety and health legislation and in those sectors which came within the statutory system for the first time under the 1989 Act.</P>
      <P>The various general duties set down in the 1989 Act for employers, self-employed, employees and others will be supplemented or expanded by a series of EC Council Directives on occupational safety and health, many of which are due for implementation by the end of this year.  I expect to receive proposals for Regulations to give effect to those Directives from the Authority in the coming months.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the provisions in the 1989 Act are effective.</P>
