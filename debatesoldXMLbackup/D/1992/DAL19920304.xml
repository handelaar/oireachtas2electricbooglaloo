      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 9, 10 and 15.  Subject to the agreement of the House, it is proposed that: (1) Nos. 9 and 10 shall be decided without debate; (2) The order of the Dáil of 26 February 1992 fixing the Committee Stage of the Control of Dogs Bill, 1991, for tomorrow be discharged and that the Committee Stage be taken after No. 9; (3) the proceedings on the Committee Stage of the Control of Dogs Bill, 1991, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment. Private Members' Business shall be No. 25.</P>

      <P>I have to ask if the proposal that Nos. 9 and 10 be decided without debate is satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal that the order of the Dáil of 26 February in respect to the fixing of the Committee Stage of the Control of Dogs Bill, 1991, for tomorrow be discharged and that the Committee Stage be taken after No. 10 today satisfactory?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with the Committee Stage of the Control of Dogs Bill, 1991, agreed?</P>

      <P>In relation to that matter, I wish to oppose the guillotining of this debate on Committee Stage. There are 51 amendments to this Bill and I do not believe it would be possible to deal adequately with them in the time being allocated.  Therefore, I oppose the guillotining of this debate.  I also wish to indicate to the Government that the proposal being mooted around the place that the Criminal Evidence Bill will be guillotined tomorrow will also be opposed by us.</P>

      <P>That is another matter.  The question is: &ldquo;That the proceedings on the Committee Stage on the Control of Dogs Bill, 1991, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put by the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment&rdquo;.  I think the question is carried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Taoiseach to agree to an early debate on the two recent reports on Greencore in view of the fact that there are issues of ministerial accountability that need to be resolved, in view of the cost of the investigations, the conflicts between their conclusions, and the fact <Col N="1387" /> that suggestions were made last night that a Minister in the present Government interfered with the court appointed inspectors in their work?  Would the Taoiseach be prepared to have a debate to clarify all these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had this matter by way of considerable questioning yesterday.  The House cannot expect a rehash of yesterday's discussion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the utmost respect, I am asking not for a debate now but simply that the Taoiseach would agree to set aside time for a debate on these matters at a later stage.  I am sure the Taoiseach wishes to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the ordering of time, I concur with the request made by Deputy Bruton.  While we may be able to wait for a number of days for the debate, the Taoiseach should take the earliest opportunity to respond to the allegation made last night about interference by a Minister in the work of the inspectors.  If the Taoiseach has had discussions with his Ministers and is in a position to deny that most serious allegation, he should take the first opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is clearly not in order now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is anxious to respond.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business asked the Taoiseach if he would allow time for a debate on the report arising from the Greencore affair. It is now more important than ever that we have that debate in view of the allegations made last night and in relation to which there appears to be documentary evidence.  We do not know yet what that evidence is, but I understand the person who made the allegation claims he has submitted papers in that regard.  Would the Taoiseach make a statement in the <Col N="1388" /> House and say what involvement, if any, a Minister in his Government had in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to dissuade Members from calling on the Government or anyone else to make statements in the House at this juncture. There are many other ways of raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of concern not just to the Government but to this House.  In the last few weeks this House confirmed in office as a Minister of this Government somebody who interfered &mdash; if we are to believe the allegations made last night &mdash; with inspectors appointed by the courts.  This should be of concern to you, Sir, and to all Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Doubtless this House will find a way of deliberating on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is sufficient for the Taoiseach to remain silent and for you not to demand him to clarify this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has received five or six reasonable requests on the Order of Business whether the Government intend to make time available to debate this matter, and I think that is in order.  The Taoiseach's silence, if it is maintained, will be judged for what it is &mdash; fear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the length and the cost of the investigation, can the Taoiseach indicate the nature and <Col N="1389" /> purpose of the Minister's intervention in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to make a statement to the House or direct another member of the Government to do so on the Government's attitude to the McSharry reform proposals on the Common Agricultural Policy?  I see the Taoiseach is smiling but this is not a funny matter.  In today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> the Minister for Agriculture and Food is quoted as saying he has no difficulty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach if he will let us know what is the Government's policy regarding the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I seek your guidance, a Cheann Comhairle.  What is the status of an inquiry that is requested by the House and agreed to by the Government? Would it not be fair to assume that when such an inquiry is completed the report of the inquiry should be referred back to the House for debate and discussion?

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;guard dog&rsquo; means a dog used primarily for the purpose of guarding any premises other than a premises solely used and occupied as a dwelling house.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> Extensive representations have been received by Deputies on all sides of the House from people concerned about dog ownership and the description of dogs. They wish the Minister to take advantage of the opportunity given by this legislation to tackle this matter in a more efficient manner and to have proper description included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to have guard dogs described because of the particularly nasty incidents which gave rise to the Minister taking such draconian powers.  These incidents concerned abandoned guard dogs and not dogs in private ownership in dwelling houses.</P>
    <P>Probably everyone in this House has an animal or pet of some sort at home. Even the former Minister, the man who brought in this Bill, owns a labrador. That labrador and the former Minister were seen on a beach in Mayo at the weekend.  He did not have that dog muzzled; he did not have it on a leash&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should take this opportunity to define properly the people he wants to get at, the people who have these savage animals which are, in the main, guard dogs.  The people involved in the campaign against muzzling and who have made representations through various dog organisations are caring and responsible people who look after their pets properly.  That is true of almost everyone who has a dog as a pet in their house.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that people using guard dogs to guard their dwellings would be exempt from the requirements of regulations made to ensure the welfare of guard dogs, and that is not acceptable.  The main <Col N="1399" /> reason for providing specifically for the welfare of guard dogs is that they may be badly treated specifically for the purpose of ensuring their ferocity and their antipathy to intruders.  It is no less likely that this would happen in the case of a dog kept to guard a dwelling and, therefore, these dogs deserve the same protection of the law as do other guard dogs.</P>
      <P>The other powers to regualte the use of guard dogs relate specifically to the use of guard dogs at premises used wholly or mainly for the purpose of any business, profession or occupation.  Obviously this would not include a premises used solely as a dwelling house, so the amendment will not have any real effect.  The Deputy will appreciate, when he has had an opportunity to consider this more fully, that what is really involved here is ensuring  that we have a type of law enforced by regulations which takes account of all types of circumstances.  This is what we are seeking to do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to engage in any greater discussion on the points referred to in the amendment.  It is important that specific reference be made in the course of the legislation to the question of guard dogs, to the specific category of dog that we have in this State that can commonly be described as a guard dog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what the Minister is attempting to do &mdash; to control dangerous dogs. There is nobody in the House who would not go a considerable length of the way with the Minister's proposals.  However, it is important that we define a guard dog because what the Minister describes as dangerous dogs are almost exclusively guard dogs, specifically trained by their owners or persons in charge of them to ensure the safety of a premises or persons. Looking at the statistics of fairly vicious attacks by dogs in recent years one is entertained almost exclusively by the guard dog, in many cases, bred, fed and trained to become a particularly vicious animal whose owner will defend it by stating that it is necessary in this day <Col N="1400" /> and age to have an animal on a premises for no other reason than to ensure that anybody entering those premises, lawfully or unlawfully, will be put on notice, if not put in fear, of their personal safety, by the mere existence of that vicious animal.  While the Minister introduces power to destroy certain vicious, dangerous animals, we need to specify what we mean by a &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo; within the overall category of dangerous dogs.  Replying to this debate or on Report Stage, perhaps the Minister would come up with a definition of what can be described primarily as a &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my extreme disappointment at the Minister's reply.  From my reading of the Principal Act it would appear it contains no definition of a &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;&mdash; if I am correct, perhaps the Minister could inform me in what section of the Principal Act there is a definition of &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;&mdash; nor is it proposed in this Bill to define &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It seems to be absolutely essential to insert some definition of &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;. My party have proposed a definition.  We do not contend it is the absolute answer but it would appear to be a reasonable definition.  If the Minister were to propose something slightly or substantially different, we would examine any such proposal carefully; at least it would constitute an effort on the Minister's part.</P>
      <P>We need to think through its implications. If there is no definition of a &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo; included then one is dependent on the English language or on dictionaries. My common sense would tell me that a guard dog is a dog kept for guarding; that is putting it very simply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People buy and use dogs for a wide variety of purposes.  If one were to ask the average home owner who keeps a dog what is their purpose in keeping that dog one might get a different answer depending on the day of the week one posed that question.  People buy and keep dogs for an infinite variety of purposes. We have had dogs.  I do not know whether they would have been regarded <Col N="1401" /> as guard dogs, we just kept dogs and I suppose they guarded our house.</P>
    <P>Surely we are introducing a huge element of bureaucracy here.  For example, are the provisions to apply to everyone who owns a dog?  It could be argued that every dog is a guard dog, whether it be a Pekingese or a Rottweiler? With regard to the question of possible cruelty to dogs, I take the Minister's point that he is anxious, and rightly so, to protect dogs from cruel owners.  I put it to him that this is bureaucracy gone mad.  Every dog owner, whether it be a guard dog or not, has a responsibility to look after that animal; if they do not they can be prosecuted under the relevant legislation.  Indeed, people are prosecuted frequently for treating dogs cruelly; they can be convicted, fined and imprisoned, and rightly so.  In my view, this is introducing a complete layer of bureaucracy.  Unless the Minister can convince me to the contrary, I feel very strongly that this amendment should be pressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to remove some misunderstanding about this amendment, might I refer the Minister to the second paragraph of the explanatory memorandum which reads:</P>
      <P>The Bill makes a number of amendments to provisions of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, which have been found in practice to be deficient.  These include restricting a general dog licence to dogs kept at one premises, requiring the production of a dog licence before recovering a seized dog,</P>
      <P>Then it continues:</P>
      <P>empowering a dog warden to enter premises (other than a dwelling) where a guard dog is kept...</P>
      <P>Obviously, there is a misunderstanding in that because, if a guard dog is in a dwelling, it precludes a dog warden from entering.  There is a reference there which separates a dwelling from a guard dog, as opposed to a guard dog in any other premises not a dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1402" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend this is a very good amendment.  I am surprised the Minister has not taken it on board. Indeed, I am somewhat confused by his response.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Garland said, there is no definition of &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo; in the Principal Act or in the Bill before us.  Yet, in section 6 of the Bill before us &mdash; which replaces section 19 of the Principal Act &mdash; there are a number of very specific references to the term &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;.  For example, it is proposed to enable the Minister to make regulations specifying the kinds of standards of premises in which a guard dog may be kept, to enable him make regulations providing for the registration of premises in which a guard dog can be kept.</P>
      <P>Two issues arise here.  First, how does one define what is a &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;?  There are many types of dogs which could be described as a &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;.  In fact, in some respects I suppose any dog could be classified as a guard dog, but it is fair to assume that what are intended here are dogs kept specifically for the purpose of guarding premises, businesses or whatever; at present the provisions virtually apply to premises of a commercial nature.  However, there are cases where it is quite clear that a dog is being kept for the purposes of guarding a private dwelling.  One need not travel very far to see sings on gateways &ldquo;beware of guard dog&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, such signs are becoming ever more common these days. The issue that arises here is that clearly those dogs are bought and kept for the purposes of guarding those particular premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister include in his regulations a requirement that domestic dwellings must be registered with the relevant local authority in order for example, that a householder, may keep an Alsatian, which some householders keep, or will he allow circumstances prevail in which dog wardens will be required to inspect domestic dwellings and the kinds of facilites provided in those dwellings for the retention of guard dogs?  I know the Minister said that is not <Col N="1403" /> the intention but I am puzzled by section 6 (2) (c) which reads:</P>
    <P>make provision for the regulation of the use of guard dogs at or in the immediate vicinity of premises used wholly or mainly for the purposes of any business, profession or occupation;</P>
    <P>I would assume that the term &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; would relate to a domestic dwelling. The issue needs to be cleared up: what is or what is not a &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo;; do the regulations cover domestic dwellings or not?  Could the provisions of this Bill be used, as many people fear, as an unwarranted intrusion into private dwellings and/or people's homes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Running through this debate since it began are some misconceptions which have arisen again here this morning, first and foremost, the question of &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo; not being defined in the Principal Act.  Most Members in this legislative Chamber will have had some experience of how and where specific terms should be defined. By and large matters like that are almost inevitably dealt with by way of regulation and that is the appropriate place in which to include this definition.  For the benefit of the House I will read out the provision in the Control of Dogs Act, 1986 (Guard Dogs) (Amendment) Regulations, 1989:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;guard&rdquo; dog means a dog which is being used&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to protect premises, or (b) to protect goods or property kept on premises, or (c) to protect a person guarding premises or such goods or property,</P>
      <P>and includes any dog brought to or kept on premises to which article 3 of these Regulations applies unless it is shown that such dog was not brought to or kept on premises for any of the purposes specified at (a), (b) and (c);</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of a guard dog is enshrined in existing law.  I know that Deputies are extremely busy and do not have the same <Col N="1404" /> support facilities as the Minister.  I am not comdemning anyone by what I am saying but it is important in the context of this debate to work through the day on the basis of trust.  There is not a hidden agenda.  I want to succeed in putting in place a law supported by regulations which deals primarily with the threat to public safety and to help dog lovers and dog owners, whether they keep dogs on their premises as guard dogs or as pets. Dog lovers, as well as everyone else, are as anxious as I am to deal with the uncared for, unfed, dangerous dogs marauding around the country, specifically in the areas we have dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is not necessarily the case that regulations relating to guard dogs would apply to dogs used to protect premises, even if the power was there.  They could be excluded if the Minister deemed it appropriate. If they were included, the type of regulations which would be made would govern the type of accommodation required for the dog and would require the provision of food and drink for the dog.  They could also require that the premises be registered with the local authority.  These are all reasonable requirements to provide for a dog which is being kept to protect a premises, as against a dog being kept as a domestic pet.  I am seeking to be flexible here.  We may or may not in certain circumstances want to put these regulations into effect, but the effect of the amendment before me is to exclude the possibility of being able to enforce a regulation, for instance where there was an undesirable development with regard to a dangerous dog if the dog was being used to guard a premises as distinct from a business.  Deputies will accept that in that context it would be more appropriate to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Having heard the Minister mention regulations, I have further goose pimples. Three times I raised the Abattoirs Act, where regulations were to be implemented.  Carlow County Council have spent £75,000, because the Ministers are funking bringing in regulations. <Col N="1405" /> Surely it is in this Bill that we should have the definition of a guard dog so that it can be discussed.  The Minister can make regulations and they cannot even be raised on the Order of Business because they are not legislation, and everybody is shut out of the whole thing.  Surely this is the place to deal with the definition. The Minister should stop hiding behind regulations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne is as familiar as most of us with the way matters of this kind are dealt with in the House. It was the Deputy's party who introduced the Bill in 1986 with wide support.  This is a normal procedure.  The regulations provide a certain flexibility so that each time we need to make a change in the face of circumstances which could not be foreseen during the passage of the Bill, it could be dealt with without the House being constrained to pan amendments to legislation wherever change is needed before being able to take action.  Many Deputies on the opposite side have consistently made that argument and so do I.</P>

    <P>With regard to the question about when the regulations will be decided on and enforced, I am meeting the requests of Deputies by saying that before introducing regulations I will have the widest possible consultations with Members in the context of this Bill, and with associations interested in these matters.  I am not in a hurry to introduce regulations which might not be fair, which might not deal with the problem and which might not support what I consider to be about one-third of the owners of dogs who are careful and loving with regard to their animals.  Unfortunately, throughout the country there are people who do not consider the dog to be man's best friend, who keep dogs and train them to be dangerous and a threat to the public; who keep them in abominable conditions without food in order to make them vicious.  Parents have approached me complaining that they and their children are afraid to walk through parks because of such vicious dogs.  Let us be frank about it.  We are not introducing this legislation for the <Col N="1406" /> sake of being here all day.  We are trying to deal with a situation.  I will be as flexible, as open and as helpful as I can be to Deputies in the context of what we are trying to do and in the spirit of the regulations which will ultimately be introduced. The regulations will be based on wide consultation.  I make that firm commitment to the House.</P>

      <P>Under section 6 there will be a provision for the Minister to make regulations and those regulations may require premises to be registered with a local authority for the keeping of guard dogs.  They require those premises to meet certain standards which will be specified in legislation, and may also involve the inspection of premises by dog wardens.  There are many homes in my constituency and, I am sure, in other constituencies, where one regularly sees the notice &ldquo;Beware of Guard Dog&rdquo; on the gate and inside one sees a large dog. This often has the effect of dissuading those of us who are about our electoral business from pursuing it in the way we would like to.  Is it the Minister's intention to require these domestic premises to be registered with local authorities? Is it the Minister's intention that those domestic premises will have to meet the standards set down in regulations or that they can be inspected by dog wardens? Will the Minister clarify that at this stage so that we will know what we are getting into?</P>

      <P>There would be no point in introducing legislation of this kind unless it had the widest possible scope in terms of dealing with the problems to which Deputy Gilmore refers.  The question of registration and the question of the dog wardens having the right of access and so on, will be dealt with as firmly and as resolutely as possible.  There would be little point in having regulations and in having this Bill passed if a warden did not have the option to visit a premises where he or she suspected there was improper handling or management of a dog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder about the wisdom of introducing regulations. Regulations are laid before the House, but we do not always have the opportunity to debate them.  I note that the Minister has indicated his willingness to discuss with other Members the merits or demerits of various regulations when and if they are introduced.  Like my colleagues, I am a little concerned about that aspect as it leaves matters too vague and does not make provision for the open-ended debate that one would feel is necessary in relation to the amendment, and, indeed, the legislation.</P>
      <P>Arising from Deputy Gilmore's submission, may I point out that there is a danger that we may be about to generalise in order to deal with all comers, whether commercial operations providing guard dogs or ordinary householders who keep a big dog.  There is a difference.  Most householders have no wish to keep a dog of the type referred to as guard dogs except out of necessity. Generally speaking, respect for the other people's property has degenerated to the extent that people now have to maintain a guard dog or an animal of that type in order to protect themselves and their property.  There may well be a considerable difference between the legislation that should apply to the private householder and to the person providing guard dogs on a commercial basis, and whether the animals are protecting a private household within the confines of the person's property or guarding a commercial enterprise such as a factory, etc. I would like to have this matter further clarified.  I accept that the Minister is saying that the legislation is being forced upon us by virtue of previous incidents but one cannot enact legislation to resolve that problem if it imposes restrictions on individuals who are trying only to protect their own property within the confines of their own home.  There is a difference and I know the Minister is anxious to clarify the confusion arising from this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pursue the questions I put earlier.  I do not think there is any difficulty with the requirements being placed on commercial businesses or security firms to have the premises in which they keep their guard dogs registered and that they would be governed by regulations and so on, because by definition those premises may not necessarily be occupied by people all the time. Regularly we come across premises which are guarded by guard dogs and it is perfectly proper and in order that the Minister should have regulations which set down the conditions under which such dogs are kept.  I often worry about the conditions in which the dogs are kept and the Minister is quite correct to regulate them, but the difficulty that has arisen is in relation to domestic dwellings.  It is an unfortunate fact of modern life &mdash; I do not like it and I am sure other Members share my view &mdash; that a growing number of householders feel that in order to protect themselves and their families they have to have a great big dog around the house.  It is an unfortunate fact that this is becoming more and more common.  I often worry about what would happen if some of these dogs broke free from the curtilage.  It is fair to assume that in the vast majority of cases these dogs are well cared for and are something between pets and guard dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue that has arisen &mdash; and the Minister did not answer any question when I raised this point specifically &mdash; is that there is a fear among dog owners that the Minister will apply these regulations in a very draconian way.  He will have to reassure dog owners, the public and this House that that is not his intention. On the specific question of domestic dwellings, will the Minister respond to the following points?  Let us say that a private householder owns an Alsatian, will his home have to be registered with the local authority under these regulations, because this is what the Bill says? We should bring this point out into the open.  If people want to keep a big dog to protect their premises will they now have to register their home with the local authority and allow the dog warden to <Col N="1409" /> come in and inspect the dog house and will they have to comply with the standards laid down in regulation in order to keep the guard dog?  We should get a clear answer so that we will know what we are dealing with.  This was not clear from the Minister's last reply.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, may I state briefly that it is very disappointing to hear the Minister speak of proposed discussions with interested parties and lobby groups on aspects of the legislation.  I would have thought that the time to do that was prior to a debate in this House or, if not, in the course of the passage of this Bill through the House.  It is extraordinary as this Bill was published and circulated very recently and we only finished the Second Stage debate last week and the Committee Stage is due to conclude today.  Why is there such haste?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as a matter of urgency, why is the Minister not meeting with the lobby groups before the Bill is passed by this House?  The Minister referred to his powers to make regulations and he is quite right in speaking of his powers to introduce regulations.  In <Col N="1410" /> defence of his defining &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo; in regulations as opposed to legislation, he cites the feeble example that it was done on previous occasions by those at present on my side of the House.  However, since the Government took office in 1989 Ministers promised in the course of Committee Stage legislation to introduce regulations at the earliest possible date and they have failed to do so in a plethora of cases.  May I cite for the record the following: the Video Recordings Act, 1989, the Nursing Homes Act, 1990, the Abattoirs Act, 1988, referred to by Deputy Browne and now the Minister here present is promising to introduce regulations at sometime in the future after discussions with the various interest groups and parties.  What is the need for a debate on this Bill in the House if it is all going to be done by regulation at a stage when Deputies will not have the opportunity of discussing them because of the manner in which the regulations will be introduced?  Could the Minister be more specific?  As far as this side of the House is concerned, there is no hidden agenda and I wonder what the Minister means by such phraseology.  In such important legislation and having regard to the changes being made in the Principal Act I certainly question why he is vehemently opposed to introducing a definition of &ldquo;guard dogs&rdquo;.  In view of what Deputy Gilmore has said regarding a local authority register, I would ask the Minister to be a little more specific on registration with the local authorities. The Minister for the Environment is involved in the whole area of the role and function of local authorities.  As a member of a local authority, I am very concerned that this House, year in, year out, enacts legislation and foists regulations and duties on local authorities without any insistence or direction on the part of the Minister as to how these local authorities are to find the money to fund such sections of Acts or regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Laois we have a dog warden under the 1985 Act who finds it extremely difficult to carry out his functions in accordance with the legislation because the funding is not available.  If the Minister <Col N="1411" /> is now suggesting a new set of regulations and a register which will require local authority officials and dog wardens to visit on a regular basis houses and commercial premises to ascertain the nature of the dog on the premises and to compile and keep a register, will he indicate how he will fund this and guarantee that any extra and onerous tasks imposed on the local authorities will be funded directly by his Department?</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to comment on this amendment, particularly in view of the Minister's comments on the important role of regulations in dealing with these issues and the flexibility he hopes to exercise in this respect.  Unfortunately last week I was unable to contribute on Second Stage because I was attending a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. That debate collapsed very quickly and there was not a great deal of input.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>We sought to ask the Government this morning to lift the guillotine because there are 51 amendments tabled to this Bill.  Deputy Gilmore raised very important questions about the operation of the legislation in regard to guard dogs.  The Minister indicated that his approach is flexible in dealing with the regulations.  On the one hand, he <Col N="1412" /> would have regard to the interests of the genuine dog owner who looks after his animal well and takes a serious interest in his wellbeing.  On the other hand, there are unscrupulous owners who exploit dogs for all kinds of nefarious ends and allow them to run wild in parks, endangering young children.</P>
      <P>Regulations, legislation and flexibility of attitude all mean absolutely nothing if the proper resources are not put in place. Dublin city is a good illustration.  The entire city is served by three dog wardens who are expected to regulate and control dogs wandering the streets, dogs in private houses, in industrial premises and in security companies.  As we have learned recently by way of a court case, they are also expected to regulate and control dogs in dog fighting circles.  Three wardens are expected to do all this work and I do not need to labour the point about what this means in terms of effectiveness. In 1990 the dog wardens in Dublin issued 3,400 ten-day notices to owners of unlicensed dogs to produce a licence.  They also issued 1,200 on-the-spot fines but not one court action or prosecution has been taken arising from all that work.  One of the dog wardens appointed under the ISPCA in May 1989 has not to date been required to give evidence in a court case regarding anything done in his work.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's last set of regulations, the wardens have been looking for an allocation of funding from the Department of the Environment.  They have two Toyota vans bought in 1987 for their service.  They are looking for protective suiting to deal with the more vicious animal as well as tranquilisers and tranquiliser guns to take down vicious animals.  None of that has been provided to date &mdash; the Minister should not shake his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of this morning I was speaking to one of the three Dublin wardens who confirmed the up-to-date position.  At present they are operating a work to rule and they are not operating any of the regulations dealing with the more dangerous type of animal.  They are basing their position on the health and <Col N="1413" /> safety regulations which apply to all workers.  They are not adequately equipped and are not prepared to put themselves in the way of dangerous animals. The man I spoke to this morning told me that in the course of his work so far he has strangled four dogs, shot two Rottweilers and poisoned one dog because this was the only way to deal with such dangerous animals.  Leaving aside what that represents in terms of the policy of the ISPCA, his immediate employer whose job it is to avoid cruelty to animals, the Minister will appreciate the difficulties encountered by wardens.</P>
    <P>The flexibility of which the Minister speaks regarding his approach to regulations can mean nothing unless his Department are prepared to give financial support to those regulations and ensure that adequate numbers of staff are employed and given the necessary resources to do the job.</P>
    <P>The wardens in Dublin are not in a position to deal with the scale of the problem of stray dogs in parks.  Under the 1985 legislation the Minister has given the local authority responsibility for dealing with the overall situation, but he allows them to contract out, and in Dublin they have contracted out to the ISPCA who, in turn, employ the wardens. The manager or administrative officer who wrote to the ISPCA on 10 February suggested that two wardens concentrate on the licence follow-up while the third warden would handle the day-to-day calls.</P>
    <P>In order to deal with licensing as proposed in this Bill and in the proposed regulations, and in the context of this guard dog amendment, the manager in Dublin corporation is suggesting that two of the three wardens be assigned to going to people's homes where there are warning signs about guard dogs, going into factories and security companies and knocking on doors asking for the licence, and if it is not produced they are fined on the spot.  While all this is being done no cases are being taken to court because of the lack of resources.  The third warden of the city of Dublin then has to go out on <Col N="1414" /> the streets and chase stray and vicious dogs.</P>

      <P>I take your stricture.  I am trying to address the point the Minister talked about of the regulations being flexible.  I am trying to illustrate that while regulations and legislation have been in existence for some years they are meaningless because of the lack of a departmental response.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council have three and a half wardens because they share one with Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  The geographical spread of the county is, even more thinly addressed than in Dublin city.  It is all very well for us to be legislating and regulating, but we are only fiddling while the problem is escalating daily.  Until we put wardens on the street who are adequately equipped, the Minister can keep his regulations and his legislation because they are achieving nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I wish to refer to the Minister's reply on my previous comment.  I agree with him on the number of dogs in the country, some of which are ill-treated, and I accept that this Bill is necessary, but I should like to make a point of principle.  As one of the 166 Deputies elected to this House, I think I share some responsibility for legislation passed here.  We are pilloried every day by the media who, when they have nothing better to do, decide there is an easy target which is to decide that TDs are a useless lot.  The leader of my party, Deputy Bruton, has emphasised at different times that 15 TDs run the entire show and the rest of us might as well be at home.  For that reason, when the Minister brings in a Bill, such as the Control of Dogs Bill, the first thing we should have is a definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to mitigate the seriousness of a case some time ago where a <Col N="1415" /> father was not properly identified in court and was let go scot free.  Here we are talking about the control of dogs and we cannot define what a guard dog is.  We should have such a definition in this legislation. If something happens later which suggests there is some anomaly &mdash; for example, if a breed of Alsatian has only one eye, two legs and one ear the Minister may wish to insert a regulation exempting them, or if pomeranians have been exempted in the definition and some of them grow savage through some defect in the genes &mdash; the Minister may want to include them in the regulations.  In passing legislation like this it is indefensible that a definition is not included on which we can agree or disagree.  After a while the Minister will be the only person who can decide what a guard dog is, and then nobody can do anything about it.  Journalists will write articles asking what kind of TDs we have and saying that when this Bill went through the Dáil there was no protest.  On principle, we should have a definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy McCartan that time is not on our side.  A number of amendments have been tabled and it is unlikely we will get through them all.  Therefore, it would be a pity to spoil the debate by bickering and wasting time.  Like Deputy McCartan, I am sorry I did not get an opportunity to contribute on Second Stage.  I did not expect it would end so quickly and I was involved in internal party business.  By the time I was free, Second Stage had concluded.  Nevertheless, it is important for us today to amend the Bill as best we can to ensure we have good legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for dog control is an emotive subject.  An opportunity was lost in not having consultations with the relevant bodies, who made written submissions to the Minister before this debate.  I know there is no point crying over spilt milk, but there was a campaign against muzzling. The Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Irish Veterinary Association, the Irish Kennel Club, etc., <Col N="1416" /> were willing to meet and discuss with the Minister how the Bill could be improved, but rather than put the cart before the horse, as we are doing now by meeting them afterwards, had the Minister met them initially the Bill would have been strengthened.  Contrary to what one may read in the press, the dog has an important role in society, it is a pet and companion. That is not always emphasised because sensational attacks on children, especially in Britain, and one or two in Ireland have monopolised the headlines. We do not emphasise sufficiently the value of owning a dog.  Everybody in this House agrees with the Minister that there is a need to eliminate vicious dogs.  The breeding and training of such animals is dangerous to humans and cruel to the animals concerned.  In this respect we would have gained more had the Minister taken time to meet the relevant bodies.</P>
    <P>In his Second Stage speech the Minister said he took note of the points they made, but that is not good enough; had he met these groups personally, some of the ambiguities in the Bill, would have been eliminated.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the language in this legislation should be more specific or new ambiguities will be introduced to the legislation. Perhaps the Minister would agree with the points which have been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved this amendment. I am disappointed the Minister did not indicate that he considered it necessary to have a definition of &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo; or that he would introduce a definition on Report Stage.  As has been outlined by all other Deputies, there is a need for such a definition.  The Minister talked about the regulations and how effective they are.  In Section 5 of the current regulations there is a definition which states that the dog should be led.  Anybody who owns or who has taken out a dog will understand that many dogs insist on leading their owners.  A dog is easier to control <Col N="1417" /> and supervise when he is leading rather than being led.</P>
      <P>The value of the regulations can be questioned.  I am giving that as an example of defects which have been brought to my attention. Perhaps the Minister would address the real difficulty which was outlined by Deputy Gilmore concerning people who have domestic pets, for example, the widow living alone who has &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo; posted on the gate.  That guard dog could be a little terrier which is strong-willed about who should be allowed to come to the door, and which certainly could not be described as dangerous.  The Minister would make this legislation more effective by inserting a definition of &ldquo;guard dog&rdquo; because of the commercial aspect which requires to be met.</P>
      <P>There are people who provide a professional service and by starting off with a clear definition we would isolate domestic pet owners and enable the people who will be charged by the Minister with the responsibility of administering the regulations to see to it that they are complied with.  As other Deputies have pointed out only a limited amount of finance is available.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether he intends to take another look at this matter and introduce a definition on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to what Deputy Gilmore said some time ago.  In relation to the requirements to be met under this section there is a vast difference in regard to the persons likely to use guard dogs and types of animals to be used.  It is highly unlikely that a group of chihuahuas are going to create a security problem or attack the neighbours, but there are three categories and the definition is important in this respect. First, I see nothing wrong with an elderly person living alone on the ground floor of a building in either an urban or rural area owning a dog because there is a serious security problem with which they have to contend.  It is not their fault that they have to keep an animal which could <Col N="1418" /> be decribed as a guard dog under the definition section.</P>
      <P>Second, those who have to protect their own factories, premises and shops can say that the necessity they are responding to by keeping animals is not of their own making, that it has been forced upon them by the situation which prevails in this land at present.  Whether we like it or not that is a fact.  They can rightly say to us, as legislators, that there would be no need for them to have animals on the premises in the first place were it not for the fact that they have been forced to do so.</P>
      <P>Third, there is the bunch of thugs who organise, breed, train, feed and bait animals for a specific purpose.  They walk around streets in our cities, towns and villages at night with one purpose only in mind and that is to terrorise and intimidate other people to gain an advantage in some way.  We need to separate the blanket description of all such animals. When I see someone with a pair of pitbull terriers walking down a street at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.  I often wonder where they are going.  It is very peculiar.  Indeed, it is a peculiar time of the night to bring dogs for a walk.  It is equally peculiar to see someone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In that context, let me compliment Deputy Kemmy for his contribution. I am starting off a period of whatever length in the Department of the Environment and I have always tried in the past and will continue to try in the future to be as open and fair as I can to all my colleagues.  I am not going to be drawn into an argument as to whether regulations were put in place in the past by other Ministers because we have a job to do here today and we are going to work at it, together if we can.  It is also clear from what has been said, in particular by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy McCartan, that we have a problem on our hands.  Let me suggest to those who say that we should leave things as they are that if anyone looks at the situation which prevails around the country, and particularly in parts of our cities, they will know that we cannot do this.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan raised the question of whether the services and resources available to the dog warden services are adequate or inadequate.  The figures that he has given for Dublin city and county are accurate.  I understand that there are seven in total.  One could put forward the argument that we should have more; one could put forward that type of argument in relation to every Bill that will ever be introduced in this House, but these resources have to be provided by the taxpayer or by society as a whole.  Needless to say, we have to be conscious of the fact tht the services provided are the best that we can afford.  In this instance we are seeking to increase the licence fees.  This should enable use over time to provide an enhanced service.</P>

      <P>I will not suggest to the Deputy that we will always be able to meet needs everywhere but we have been able to improve the service.  My Department provide 100 per cent grants for the purchase of vans and resources for the purchase of tranquillisers.  I understand, however, that there is an ongoing debate on whether it is desirable to use this system.  We also provide resources for the purchase of protective clothing. Therefore we have gone a fair distance down the road to meet this new need. We will consider the question of whether we should hold further consultations on the possibility of providing additional resources, either from my Department or the local authorities, in the light of our ability to meet those needs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the central question of whether each individual will be required to register with the local authority if they own a guard dog yet to be specified in the regulations.  That is not my intention.  Under the existing proposals any dog owner who owns more than five dogs will be required to register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the regulations, the argument has been made by Deputy Kemmy and others that we should not proceed any further until we have an opportunity to meet all the interests concerned.  The Bill was published last October.  Therefore we have not been rushing to introduce it in the House.  Furthermore, there has been the widest possible consultation nationally with the various associations. Fortunately, during the past ten days I have had the opportunity to meet representatives of the Irish Kennel Club and of various other interests.  In some cases they came to my Department and in others they visited my clinics.  Other people have, thankfully, taken the time to write detailed letters to me in regard to all these matters.  There is no way that a Minister for the Environment could legislate to meet the needs outlined to me at these meetings because they vary enormously.  Caring associations have their own agenda, a good and legitimate one, but, sometimes with the best will in the world, they are unable to take account of the concept of dog owners <Col N="1421" /> who do not treat owners in the way the association do.  If we had to deal only with the Irish Kennel Club and a number of other important groups of dog lovers, there would be no need for this legislation. However, everybody does not treat a dog properly.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>If Members disagree with the regulations which I will be introducing they will have an opportunity to raise the matter in the House.  During a debate on a Bill it is most unusual to have all the aspects relating to regulations enshrined simultaneously.  Deputies Gilmore and Carey referred to &ldquo;pet&rdquo; guard dogs.  I do not see dogs which are protecting premises, businesses and so on being treated in the way suggested by the Deputies. However, I have had very strong representations from the ISPCA in relation to having a residual power to deal with certain situations.  That is what I am hoping to have in this legislation.  It will not be a wholesale intrusion, it will apply in a minority of cases where there is evidence to suggest that it should be so. I have tried to allay the fears expressed in the House.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity, albeit brief, to listen to the views of various groups throughout the country who are interested in this.  In the final analysis, in changes I propose in regard to muzzling regulations and in other areas, I hope to go a long way in meeting the legitimate desires of people throughout the country who love their dogs and who will not be threatened by the legislation.  However, I must put sufficient controls in place to deal with the other problems outlined by many contributors.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Section I agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 9 to 14, to delete subsection (1), and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" />&ldquo;(1) Section 1 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of the definition of `general dog licence'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the principal Bill there are two types of dog licences provided for, the first is an individual dog licence and the second is a general dog licence.  The Bill endeavours to tighten up the definition of a general dog licence and to confine it to a number of dogs at a specific location so that it would not be possible to have a general dog licence for a number of dogs located in different kennels, premises or whatever.</P>
    <P>The amendment which Deputy McCartan and I tabled seeks to remove the definition and concept of the general dog licence.  The reasoning behind this is that we do not think there should be a bulk licence for numbers of dogs.  There is a general problem with the licensing of dogs, something which Deputy McCartan mentioned earlier.  At the moment about three-quarters of the dog population are not licensed.  Only a minority of dogs are licensed and I suspect that the problem regarding the control of dogs has more to do with unlicensed than licensed dogs.  It is fair to say that people who go to the trouble of licensing their dogs, generally speaking, take care of them.  The problem in local communities and housing estates in regard to harassment of animals, by and large, come from the three-quarters of the dog population which are literally wild.  They are wild in the sense that they are not licensed and are running wild.</P>
    <P>We are talking about quite a large dog population.  The Minister said there are 750,000 dogs in the country and about 600,000 are unlicensed.  It is an enormous population of uncontrolled dogs.  There should be a licence for every dog, that is the best way to identify the dog population and to control it.  I cannot see the justification for a general dog licence or a reduction for numbers.  Two situations have been suggested to me, one is where animal welfare organisations who take in dogs get a general dog licence to cover them.  Unfortunately, in the Bill, the <Col N="1423" /> Minister will not allow for that because it will eliminate the possibility of a general dog licence for dogs kept in different premises.  The second situation which arises is where dogs are kept for commercial reasons.  It appears that the bulk of the general dog licences issued are for people in that category.  The most recent figures I have relate to 1990 but I do not suppose they are greatly different in their general profile for 1991.</P>
    <P>In most local authorities the numbers of general dog licences is in the order of three or four.  In Dublin county there were three or four issued to security companies and commercial organisations who were keeping large numbers of dogs for commercial use.  The big incidence of general dog licences is in Cork county, Limerick county and, to a lesser extent in Tipperary South-Riding and Kerry.  I suspect that is because of the greyhound industry, for which I have great affection. However, there should not be class distinction in regard to dogs, whereby dogs owned for commercial purposes, either by security companies or by greyhound owners and breeders, have a reduced licence.  The individual dog owner, for example, a householder, should not have to proportionately pay a larger licence fee.</P>
    <P>The reason we tabled this amendment is to tease out why an advantage is being given to commercial interests who are making money out of their dogs.  Security companies do quite well from keeping dogs for commercial reasons.  The greyhound industry would probably argue very strongly &mdash; with some justification in recent years &mdash; that there is not much money to be made from their industry. Nevertheless, businesses which keep dogs for commercial purposes should not have an advantage when it comes to licensing.  People should not be able to place a bulk order, so to speak, for licences so that 20 or 30 dogs could be licensed effectively at a reduced rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment for the reason outlined by Deputy Gilmore.  I consider it unfair that commercial <Col N="1424" /> interests who own a large number of dogs may buy a bulk licence while individual dog owners will have to pay £10 for each dog.  As Deputy Gilmore said, there can be three dogs on a premises in the city and four dogs in a premises in the county.  Two of the largest security firms servicing the Dublin area, Swatzfall Security and Brentwood Security Ltd., have over 100 dogs each.  There is a financial advantage for those companies who can buy a general dog licence for £100, which will be increased to £200 under this Bill.  If the Minister holds hard on the concept of a general dog licence, Deputy Gilmore and I have put down an amendment which proposes a more realistic figure.</P>
      <P>We include the greyhound industry in our amendment.  I hope the Minister is referring to the greyhound track industry and not to the other wellknown Tipperary past-time where unfortunate live hares are chased by greyhounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore may have overlooked this point but I am distinguishing between the two.  I support one sector of the greyhound industry but I have very grave reservations and am downright opposed to the other sector.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of dog kennels. People maintain dog kennels to facilitate people who want their dogs looked after while they are abroad.  Dog breeding is a very lucrative business. Pedigree dogs are bred in small units which sometimes may have litters of ten and 12 pups.  As I said, there is an element of unfairness there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is linked to revenue. I referred earlier to the under resourcing of this industry.  As I understand it, a proportion, if not all, of the revenue collected in licence fees is used to develop the service.  If I am wrong I ask the Minister to clarify this point when he is replying. Dog wardens are able to identify <Col N="1425" /> organisations which keep a large number of dogs and can follow them up.  Because these organisations earn substantial revenue from their enterprise they should be expected to make a contribution to the area of dog regulation generally.  This would be of benefit to kennels, breeders and the security industry.  It would also ensure that there was some regulation of the dog population, which clearly does not exist at present.  While organisations which keep a large number of dogs are an easy target, so to speak, they have the resources to make a contribution to this area.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to take on board our proposal that there should be one licence for each dog, I ask him to indicate whether he is disposed to having a more realistic fee for a general licence. We have suggested £1,000 for a general licence but perhaps we can agree a lower figure.  This would enable us to deal properly with this issue.  The one dog, one licence concept will help to regulate this area.  Together with computerisation, this should not prove to be a difficulty for a properly run service.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to our amendment. There is a basic unfairness in the Bill and it would appear that it was the commercial lobby in the dog industry who made the case for a general dog licence in the first instance.  I ask the Minister to take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the general principle of the Minister's intention which is to strengthen and tighten up the licensing of dogs.  Perhaps it is a reflection on us that after 70 years of self-government we are only now doing this.  While there were other priorities to be met, nevertheless this should have been done long ago.  Deputy Gilmore made a very telling point in support of his amendment. It is a known fact that most dogs are not licensed.  Every day we see stray dogs roaming the streets of our cities and towns without any control whatsoever.  It is a terrible indictment on us that we can treat animals like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> I support the points made in regard to greyhound racing at tracks.  Greyhound owners are not always free from blame in their treatment of animals.  I grew up beside the greyhound racing track in Garryowen in Limerick and it was known that dogs which were brought there for trials and which did not measure up were turned loose on the streets.  Sometimes greyhound owners dealt with the dogs in a more drastic way, something I will not go into today.  Like Deputy McCartan, I believe greyhound racing in greyhound tracks where there is regulation is far preferable to coursing which I do not believe is a sport at all and which I should like to see outlawed.  Some of those sports emerged in a more tribalistic society and today we have a more civilised attitude to animals.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to deal with the issue of control of dogs in a fair and open way. We are trying to learn from our experiences of the past.  I question whether a general licence would be open to abuse. Naturally, honest people will register every dog but perhaps the Minister is being too trusting of people who, as Deputy Gilmore said, are out to make money from dogs.  I fear that this provision may be open to abuse and will be abused.  While I understand the principle enshrined in the Bill, I believe it will be open to abuse by people who keep large numbers of dogs.  The Minister will not have adequate staff to check whether the numbers submitted to his Department are correct.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of registration for all dogs.  However, this gives the Minister great powers over dog owners.  Those powers must be exercised in a balanced way and consideration will have to be given to the civil liberties of people.  In addition, the value of dogs and the companionship they give to their owners must be measured against the need for control. Does the Minister think that this provision will be open to abuse by people who own a large number of dogs and who may not necessarily give an accurate figure to his Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Gilmore, McCartan <Col N="1427" /> and Kemmy have pointed out some problems, but these matters are being addressed in the context of this legislation. The 1986 Act provided that a licensee may have any number of dogs at any number of premises for a general licence of £100.  That was certainly open to abuse.  It was likely in those circumstances that a security firm with dogs at a number of premises would pay much less on average in licensing their dogs than would the person with one or two dogs.  It also presented an opportunity for groups to form an umbrella, keeping dogs at different premises at a general licence fee of £100, and there was no limit to the number of dogs that could be kept.</P>
      <P>What we are proposing here is to increase from £100 to £200 the general dog licence, but it would cover only dogs kept at one premises.  That provision will go a long way towards meeting the requirements of the three Deputies who have spoken in this debate.  A general dog licence becomes an economic proposition only if a person keeps more than 20 dogs, and from experience, whether it is the greyhound industry or security firms, there is not a great number of people with more than 20 dogs on one premises. On that basis I cannot accept the amendment. The fears that have been expressed are largely covered by this provision, which is distinctly different from that contained in the 1986 Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House perhaps we can take amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together.  If, as suggested by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy McCartan, we increase to £1,000 the general dog licence, very few people could afford to have the numbers of dogs required at any one premises.  In some cases when people <Col N="1428" /> go on holidays they leave their dogs with kennel owners.  To expect these people to pay £1,000 for a general dog licence would be very unfair because they would have the dogs for only two or three weeks.  Such a licence fee would be very expensive and unnecessary and would discourage people from providing that service.</P>
      <P>While people sometimes suggest that everyone in the commercial sector fares extraordinarily well, we all know people in that business who are not doing as well as other.  By providing for an increase in the licence fee to £200 and confining it to one premises while at the same time catering for individual kennel owners who provide a very good service at a reasonable fee, we are allowing for the necessary flexibility.  I think therefore this provision will be acceptable to Deputies. The number of kennel owners with in excess of 100 dogs on one premises&mdash; the number necessary in one premises in order to justify a general dog licence &mdash; must be very few.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy that the two amendments be discussed together because there is a number of amendments and we are anxious to get through them.  There have been experiences in recent years where it appeared on the surface that relatively small charges or licences were being imposed but they ended up becoming nationally controversial issues.  There was the case of the hospital charges and also the famous rod licences.  The increase in dog licence fee from £5 to £10 is not huge and should not cause great difficulty.  However I suspect it will cause considerably more difficulty than we realise.  It is proposed to <Col N="1429" /> double the licence fee charged, but the problem is that three-quarters of all dogs in the country are not licensed.  We must take account of the possibility that an increase in the licence fee may result in a reduction in the numbers of dog licensed.  What we should concentrate on is increasing the number of dogs licensed rather than increasing the licence fee for those dogs that are already licensed.  The Minister is tackling the wrong problem, which is not the level of the licence fee but the number of dogs unlicensed.</P>
      <P>I wonder how the individual dog owner who licenses his or her dog will react to legislation that is already perceived by them as coming down on people who license their dogs in order to address the problem of people who do not license their dogs on the one hand, and at the same time has built into it an advantage for people who keep dogs for commercial reasons.  It will be difficult for people to accept a doubling of the dog licence fee while security companies with 100 dogs will pay the same licence as they would if they had 20 dogs.  That will not make sense to the public and it will have to be rectified.</P>
      <P>I have not tabled a specific amendment on this matter but I want to put down a marker at this stage because it is a matter to which we should return on Report Stage.  Before the Bill is passed we should give serious consideration to whether the dog licence fee should be increased at all. Even though the amount of money is small it could be the issue which would provoke an incredible backlash from lawabiding dog owners would see this legislation as impinging on their rights rather than addressing the real problem.  Rather than have the House spend a long time debating the issue of the general dog licence and the fee attaching, when other Members have contributed I shall withdraw those amendments, with a view to returning on Report Stage with amendments to deal with the levels of general dog licence and individual dog licence fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the general principle of <Col N="1430" /> increasing the licence fees.  I note the point made by Deputy Gilmore and I submit the measure could be a disincentive to those observing the rules and regulations to continue to do so.</P>
      <P>If in the course of considering legislation it transpires that the provision should be used as a vehicle for raising revenue then the purpose of the legisation would be of no benefit.  The legislation would be demeaned once it is used as a means of raising revenue.  I realise a certain amount of revenue is required to police, control and administer our legislation with regard to dogs.  However, now there is a tendency to use revenue generating aspects of legislation as a means of increasing revenue to a greater extent than is necessary.  Once legislation is used in that way it loses its impact and is of no benefit.  The outcome is that many people, for reasons of their own, have no regard for the law.  Members of local authorities know what it means to increase charges imposed under legislation &mdash; whether that legislation make provision for penalties, licence fees or whatever &mdash; for no other purpose than to generate more revenue to the Exchequer.  That practice does not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the general sentiment being expressed. There is a danger in perceiving dogs as some kind of luxury item, similar to cigarettes or drink, and increasing the cost of a dog licence regularly.  For many people, particularly older people, their dog is their only companion.  An increase in the licence fee from £5 to £10 would give pensioners a considerable jolt.  I am particularly concerned that older people on being asked to pay an increase in licence fee, may either get rid of their dog or not pay the licence fee.</P>
      <P>In the next section the Minister is given such wide powers that I fear he might, quietly and by stealth, increase dog licence fees year by year as if he were taxing some kind of a luxury item.  The Minister knows that a dog is not a luxury for many people.  On Report Stage the Minister should give the rationale behind increasing the licence fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> By increasing the licence fee will the Minister collect twice as many dog licences?  Will he use the money to increase the number of dog wardens? Dog wardens in Dublin county tell me that when this Bill is enacted there will be ample legislation but it will not be possible to implement some of the measures.  At present there are four dog wardens to cover all of Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire &mdash; there are 3.5 dog wardens for the county and a half a dog warden for Dún Laoghaire &mdash; I do not know how one divides a dog warden in half.  Those wardens say they are unable to implement existing legislation.  If the increased charge for licence fees was used in a practical way to increase survey and patrol procedures there would be some reason for it.  I will be pleased if the Minister will tell me that the extra money will be used for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first point out that I do not have charge of the money.  It is the responsibility of local authorities as to how they discharge their functions. The House is enacting the legislation and local authorities, in the exercise of their functions, will to the limit of their financial ability improve the services provided. The idea behind trying to raise increased resources and a self-sustaining operation is to improve the services so that the problems occurring throughout the country can be dealt with.  There is no other reason for increasing the fees.</P>
      <P>The licence fees were last increased in 1984.  It is reasonable to expect that they be increased to the levels proposed. Having regard to the fact that this concerns a function devolved to local authorities, it is expected that the additional resources will go 100 per cent towards the provision of services.  Many local authorities have had to provide additional finance to continue the services. No one should be in any doubt that the financial arrangements in the Bill are directed entirely and exclusively towards the improvement of warden services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to interfere with amendments Deputy Gilmore might put down <Col N="1432" /> on any other Stage, but I should like him to take into consideration a meeting I had with one of the national groups representing dog owners and caring people.  At that meeting I was advised that the group had no objection to the proposed increase provided &mdash; as mentioned by Deputy Owen &mdash; it was used to enhance services.  The group felt threatened by the measures in the Bill in relation to restrictions such as the muzzling of certain dogs and the destruction of dogs because, in their love of dogs, they did not want such conditions attached to the ownership of dogs.  The Bill would not be before the House if the majority of dogs owners were in that league but, unfortunately, that is not the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The group is prepared to accept the proposal for increase licence fees on the basis that the extra revenue is used to improve services, identify problems and sort out the dangerous dogs and the careless owners.  Once the group had been satisfied that the money will go in that direction they did not appear to me to have any great objection to the increase in fees.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy has, as we all do, an interest in ensuring that the services are improved.  We all accept that seven dog wardens for Dublin city and county is insufficient.  The wardens are stretched beyond the limit to meet the needs arising in some parts of the city that have special problems in parks and so on and also in areas that could be termed middle or upper-class, where the possibility of guard dogs breaking away presents considerable fear and risk to neighbours.</P>
      <P>I give the best assurance I can to the House that the additional revenue raised under the Bill will go directly and exclusively towards the provision of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have several questions arising from the Minister's contribution. Lest the Minister gives the impression that the seven dog wardens in <Col N="1433" /> the city and county of Dublin are able to do their jobs at present and might be stretched to implement this legislation, I wish to point out that that is not the position.  They cannot cope at present.  As I explained, the dog wardens' activities in relation to dangerous and stray animals have been suspended because they cannot get the equipment or the resources to deal with those animals.  Dog wardens through their union, have indicated that the industrial action upon which they embarked in the past week relates directly to their entitlements under health and safety regulations.  On one occasion a ten stone-cross bred dog had to be taken on.  Two of them, after a 20 minute struggle when they had been torn asunder by this animal, actually strangled it as the only way they could contain it, and the two wardens are now to be prosecuted for cruelty.  The thing is in a shambles.  We are certainly making legislative progress here today and I do not want to take away from what the Government are seeking to do because there is general support for it, but if we divorce ourselves from what is happening outside I will certainly continue to correct the record until something is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come to the concept of the general dog licence.  I am not convinced by the Minister that we should have such a licence at all.  The Minister has stated that in the case of a temporary stop-over of a dog at a kennel while its owners are away on holidays, it would be unreasonable to expect the dog kennel proprietor to buy an extra licence to cover that.  That is a practical problem of my approach to the situation, but an exception could be made of kennels.  However, all other situations could be covered, particularly as two of the single largest dog security companies in Dublin own over 100 dogs each.  Large commercial enterprises are being asked to pay £2 or less per dog for their licences while the law abiding citizen, if the Minister's proposals are passed into law today, will be expected to pay £10.  There is a basic unfairness there.  In regard to all the other areas, gun clubs, packs of fox hounds, beagles, they are very good commercial enterprises <Col N="1434" /> in their own way.  They earn good revenue and there is good access to revenue resources.  They should all, therefore, be expected to pay along the lines of what the private individual has to pay on the principal of one dog licence.</P>
    <P>I am not fixed hard on £1,000 and I accept that only in the very large enterprises, with 100 or more dogs, would it be financially sensible.  I am anxious, however, that the Minister would consider a figure somewhere between his own figure and that being suggested.  I indicated £500 as being perhaps a more workable figure.</P>
    <P>I want to put down a marker, since we intend to withdraw our amendments, that we will come back on Report Stage to the issues of whether the Minister is penalising the law abider and being too easy on commercial enterprises.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to put is in regard to how the general dog licence works in the context of a dog escaping from the premises of a man running an enterprise with an unspecified number of dogs, as the licence allows.  How does the general dog licence procedure help to trace that stray to the original owner if it is ultimately found?  Can the Minister also give an assurance that it will not be open to an amalgam of people to designate a club premises, for example, or a single premises as the place where their dog is kept, thereby allowing an amalgam of private owners, a gun club or whatever, to get around the provision of the legislation with regard to the amendment proposed in respect of a specified premises?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with Deputy McCartan's point as to whether we are being unfair to the good citizen who is continually paying for a licence as opposed to enterprises with a general dog licence and others who do not pay their licence.  We need to set a realistic target for improving the percentage of dog owners throughout the country who are paying licences and are likely to pay them.  I know that the local authorities can and do give powers to dog wardens to take up licences.  This is something which we need to improve and I will be <Col N="1435" /> looking at whatever measures I can to ensure that the burden of payments is evenly spread.  That is not currently the position.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we will agree to differ on the question of the general dog licence. There are not more than three or four general dog licences in the whole city of Dublin so this is not a great problem in the context of Dublin city.  I realise the Deputy may have been talking more in national terms.  I realise there are other cities in the country where the numbers are greater, but it seems that once I confine it to a specific premises that the number of security companies and others that would keep more than 20 dogs at one premises are few and far between.</P>
      <P>On the question of identifying a dog that escapes from a kennel for which there is a general dog licence, it is proposed to ultimately identify all dogs by tattooing or electronic means.  It will take some time to put that into effect but that is the ultimate ambition and is, perhaps, the only way of tracing a dog back to its owner.  At present the owner must come looking for the dog and will then be required to pay for its maintenance.  If the owner does not turn up the dog will be ultimately put down.  There was another matter the Deputy mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I inquired about the possibility of a group or an amalgam of people designating a premises as being where a dog is being kept for the purposes of the legislation.  I am thinking particularly of groups of people coming together for the purpose of getting a general licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the change was that under the 1986 regulations it was possible for an umbrella group to do that even though they kept the dogs at different premises.  Henceforth the specification that they must be kept at one premises will fairly exclude that possibility because probably they would not be bothered endeavouring to meet that requirement.  If one follows that argument to the point of finding the number <Col N="1436" /> of general dog licences in Dublin, the Deputy will discover that it is far from being a real problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody has adverted to the duration of the licence, whether it should be for a year or whatever.  I did not hear the Minister say he had considered issuing a licence for the lifetime of a dog. I contend that if such licence were issued it might well yield a great deal more revenue than has been the case to date. Some such licence should be considered, especially in the case of people with a particular interest in breeding dogs, whether they be greyhounds, beagles or any other type of special breed.  I am thinking of people who specialise in breeding specific types of dogs.  The Minister has not said whether he ever gave consideration to that matter.  Indeed, I should say that view has been advanced by people in the business of breeding dogs.</P>
      <P>I am a bit concerned also that the Minister has been somewhat flippant in his replies, referring to the question of equity and all the rest.  After all, the Minister will not remain in office indefinitely. He will be there for only another 18 months.  This means that we will have another cowboy, like one of the Minister's predecessors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who introduced regulations, who took his dog on to a beach in Mayo on Sunday and it bit another dog.  He had no leash or muzzle on his dog yet it was he who introduced those regulations which led to an outcry on the part of dog owners nationwide.  Surely the Minister will have heard the views of members of all parties, even those on his side of the House.  I see Deputy Liam Fitzgerald sitting behind the Minister to listen to this debate.  It is a rarity in this House to see a Fianna Fáil Deputy sit behind his Minister on a Committee Stage.  I congratulate Deputy Fitzgerald for taking that initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> I should like to understand the Minister's thinking in regard to licensing because it would appear that he wants to travel the same tired, narrow old road which will mean that, where the Garda have failed to collect these dog licences, he will put the onus or responsibility on dog wardens, saying to local authorities, &ldquo;Go out now, lads, with your nets and Hiace vans and do the collecting&rdquo;, in a live horse and you will get grass type of attitude.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what were the considerations <i>vis-á-vis</i> licences within his Department in the drafting of this Bill.  As the Minister has been prone to advert to the provisions of the 1986 Act, I might remind him that those provisions were not written on tablets of stone, they do not constitute a holy writ.  What was done then was not necessarily absolutely right.  I readily concede that whoever was Minister in 1986 made mistakes in regard to the regulations. I contend that the former Minister, Deputy Flynn, made substantial mistakes.  I should not like the present Minister to compound them by inflicting real penalties on people willing to work at these provisions.</P>
    <P>We must remember that there are other licences administered by the Minister's Department, such as driving licences, some of a year's duration, others of three years' duration and yet others of ten years' duration.  Did the Minister consider such duration with regard to dog licences?  We all know that some dogs live to be 20 years old.  It would be much more advantageous and attractive to dog owners if the Minister were to consider the issue of licences for the lifetime of a dog, especially in the case of specific breeds such as labradors. For example, the Labrador owned by the former Minister, Deputy Flynn, might last that length if it is not stricken by arthritis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since the Minister for Justice is exercising his Labrador there is no risk of it being overweight.  Owners and <Col N="1438" /> breeders of such dogs know the dogs' average life expectancy.  The Minister merely talking about dog licences costing £10 or £200 does not demonstrate much imagination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not refer to the former Minister and/or his Labrador.  I will confine myself to the amendments before us.  On the basis of the figures the Minister has given for Dublin city, I was surprised at the small number of firms or companies holding a general dog licence. I should say I was not referring at all to companies when referring to possible abuses in that area.  Rather I was referring to individual dog owners who grouped together to form a canine coursing club or some other type of dog club. Those dogs would be accommodated in peoples homes.  For the purposes of technically evading the legislative provisions they would accommodate all the dogs at one address.  That would be a way of circumventing the Bill's provisions.  The Minister did not refer to that aspect of all.</P>
      <P>I have to concede that the Minister answered me effectively, particularly about such licences in Dublin &mdash; perhaps there are more in Limerick or Cork but only a very small number in Dublin. Therefore it would be remiss of us to waste too much time discussing the provisions of this section if the figures the Minister quoted are accurate.  I had been referring to dog clubs, as such, and about people who own individual dogs and who, instead of registering or paying a dog licence in respect of each dog would pay a licence of £100 and there could be up to 200 dogs in that club.  This would totally defeat the legislative provisions. Perhaps the Minister would address that point.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's objective is to encourage all dog owners to take out licences for their animals has he considered giving them an incentive?  For instance, if henceforth dog wardens are to be responsible for ensuring that people hold licences for their dogs, has the Minister considered giving them a commission on each dog licence taken out?  Most people are well meaning, they would want to be above the law and hold licences but, very often, the matter slips their minds, they are too busy or whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with Deputy Kemmy's question first, I should say that henceforth the licence will be specifically tailored to the location where the dogs are kept as distinct from a coursing club or anybody else being able to form an umbrella group in order to evade their liabilities in this regard.  The Deputy's fears are being fairly well met by confirming it absolutely to the premises on which the dogs are kept.</P>

      <P>That brings us back to the service provided and how it is improved to meet those needs.  We will try to make sure that the new resources that will be provided in this context can go down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> With regard to Deputy Fennell's question, I explained earlier that the administration of these schemes is devolved on the local authorities.  There have been instances in other services which the council provide for which the public have an obligation to pay, where they use different systems to try to improve the percentage of payments.  That is entirely a matter for local authorities, but one way or the other we have to find a means to improve the current position.  That will be fairer all round and will enable us to have resources to improve services which are badly needed in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey and I on numerous occasions in this House have found ourselves not just on different sides of the political fence, but diametrically opposed on principle.  That has never daunted me nor changed our friendship.  I often reach the conclusion that Deputy Carey is not really serious with me, that he actually wants to take me for a drive in Clare and seek to outmanoeuvre me.  As Deputies know, it is easy to do that.  I am totally amenable to the Deputy when he wants to take me on a straight course.  I am unable to resist this one, except to say that if the proposal is that I should now become Solomon and decide not only some of the provisions we are trying to decide on here but also on the likely lifetime of dogs in order to decide on the licence fee and to bring in an incentive scheme on the basis of encouraging people to pay for the full expected life of a dog, the Deputy would be in real trouble with a number of his colleagues before he would be in trouble with me.  One way or the other the Deputy is on a collision course with me.</P>

      <P>The sweeping powers in paragraph (c) are what concern me.  Is it necessary to give the Minister power to use different classifications for dogs?  We need to obtain a balance with regard to the need to control dogs and the rights of ordinary people to enjoy dogs where they are not doing any harm to society.  In introducing breed-based measures the Minister could penalise responsible dog owners.  The section is adequate without these powers. This paragraph is unusually pernickety and it could be vexatious and cause a lot of trouble for the Minister and legislators in the future.  This paragraph should be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Kemmy in supporting the amendment.  The Minister started off on the wrong foot by not accepting the amendment with regard to the definition of guard dog.  That is creating problems of interpretation all along the line.  Under this section the Minister wants to have a wide variety of powers.  The Minister wants to vary the rates and to identify different classes and species of dog.  When replying the Minister should spell out what he has in mind here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that a licence for a number of years would be very attractive to people who intend to keep a dog for <Col N="1442" /> five or ten years or whatever the lifetime of a pet is.  A ten-year licence might not necessarily apply to one pet.  It could cover a replacement pet if one died for instance.  When replying will the Minister explain why he is taking such wide-ranging powers with regard to different breeds?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult area. These powers do not really improve on the method of issuing dog licences.  I appreciate that local authorities have been most efficient in collecting fees, but wardens who will be charged with this work will not have the time to collect licence fees.  In my constituency, and I am sure in north Tipperary, there are frequent dog attacks on sheep.  Wardens spend a lot of time picking up wild stray dogs which are roaming about in packs destroying young lambs and sheep. Where will they get the time to devote to the collection of licence fees?  The Minister is giving them a job that they cannot do.  Apart from the age problem with regard to dogs, it is possible to adopt our suggestion.  If I take out a dog licence for ten years and my dog dies in the meantime, surely it should be valid for the replacement dog, as effectively my household has a licence for a dog for ten years.  Would that not be a better way to approach this question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It could operate in the same way as a driving licence.  What is wrong with that?  We are operating in an old-fashioned bureaucratic manner, a similar system was probably introduced by the British and we are still holding on to it.  Let me appeal to the Minister to withdraw that section because he is taking too much power unto himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister as a substantial farmer in north Tipperary may keep sheep from time to time, even though he may not have sheep at present. Some of his neighbours must have sheep <Col N="1443" /> yet they keep a dog.  Indeed I am sure they take good care of their dogs.  If the Minister should decide to specify the breed of dog, will he include sheep dogs, Labradors and all the different breeds one sees around the farm or will he insist that farmers should only have collies or sheep dogs and not other different breeds?  This is implied in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague Deputy Carey's viewpoint.  I believe the Minister will be walking into a canine minefield if this section remains in the Bill.  Does the Minister propose setting up a kennel section in the Department to arbitrate in disputes?  For example should a dispute arise because a certain class of dog has a higher licence fee will there be a &ldquo;dogs' Ombudsman&rdquo; to decide on the classification of the dog.  For example my own dog is a mixture of an Afghan hound and a cocker spaniel but I do not know how much of each is in the dog.  She is a very nice dog but I do not know if she has an 80 per cent look of the Afghan or a 20 per cent cocker spaniel.  If the Minister uses this power, just to collect money, he may decide, for instance, to increase the licence fee for the Labrador class.  What happens in the case of mixed breeds, where a dog is part Labrador? As the Minister is new to this Department, the Minister may not be fully aware of what his predecessor had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not take on too much power because the Minister may find he is pressured when there is a shortage of money to use this clause to increase the fees to an unrealistic figure.  I believe the aim of this section should be to increase the number of licence holders from 170,000 to 750,000 and not to increase the amount of money paid by the 170,000 licence holders.  We should aim to increase the number who buy a licence much in the same way as the idea is to broaden the tax base rather than increase the tax paid by a small number of people.  The risk is that this section many provide a temptation for the officials to advise the Minister that, as the present dog licence fee cannot sustain <Col N="1444" /> the cost of the local authority dog warden scheme and the local authorities need more money, he should increase the licence fee to £20 or even up to £40.</P>
    <P>Therefore I appeal to the Minister to be very cautious about taking these extra powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a widespread body of opinion that what is needed at this stage is not new legislation but the enforcement of the existing legislation. The inadequacy of the 1986 Control of Dogs Act in dealing with the problem of controlling dogs has less to do with its provisions than with its enforcement.  Deputies have already referred to the small number of dog wardens employed.  Seven dog wardens are employed to cover the Dublin area, one of whom serves half time in Dún Laoghaire.  They are required to spend more of their time chasing owners to ensure they have licences rather than chasing dogs.  This will increase under this arrangement.  It seems that the Minister is providing for a self-financing system so that the law-abiding dog owners, through the payment of a licence fee, will pay for the dog warden service.  The difficulty that has occurred repeatedly is that the local authorities do not have the money to hire dog wardens.  Over the past number of years the local authority allocation has been cut back by the Minister's predecessors. The local authorities are required to implement the 1986 Act and hire a dog warden.  All of the local authorities have complied with that and have appointed one dog warden, which is purely a token gesture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way in which the local authorities can hire more dog wardens under the existing legislation is if they can collect more money in dog licence fees.  This legislation is not directed at increasing the number who pay the licence fees but at increasing the fee for those who are already paying it.  If the Minister finds that by doubling the fee the required amount of money is still not coming in he may increase the fee at will under the powers in this Bill.  We have already seen <Col N="1445" /> examples where this has happened.  For example, the fee for lodging an appeal to An Bord Pleanála was originally intended to be a token charge for the lodgment of an appeal but it has increased by over 300 per cent in the past seven or eight years.  In cases where the Minister has given himself this power to vary fees it has been used to increase the level of fees.</P>
    <P>The amendment which Deputy McCartan and I have tabled addresses a slightly different angle from this &mdash; that is the principle of whether the same licence fee should be charged for dogs of different sizes and uses.  To some extent it relates back to the debate we had earlier. It is difficult of justify that the same fee should be paid for a tiny pet as is paid for a large guard dog, and this should be addressed.  The principal matter that needs to be addressed is that it is not going to be possible to adequately provide for the control of dogs out of the licence fee moneys.  If the Minister is heading down that road, I am afraid that all the legislation passed by the Oireachtas will not resolve the problem. There are 170,000 licence holders at present and the increase proposed by the Minister will raise less than £1 million. However if the 600,000 dogs which are unlicensed were to be licensed, we would raise in the order of £3 million without ever increasing the level of the licence fee.  The legislation is headed in the wrong direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Gilmore I have no problem in principle about the financing of the dog warden service out of the licence fee.  It is a very good principle. As we all want to make a genuine effort to reduce tax as well as reducing the burden on the taxpayer it behoves us all to look at all other areas.  I believe that dog owners would accept that they have a responsibility to fund, if possible, the cost of the dog warden service.  It would be interesting to see if the Minister has any figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no excuse whatever for the non-collection of licence fees.  If there are 700,000 dogs there should be 700,000 <Col N="1446" /> licence fees collected, and if not, it is an absolute scandal.</P>

    <P>The details collected in respect of earnings relate to the gross amount paid to <Col N="1447" /> employees before deduction of income tax, PRSI, etc., include overtime, service pay, shift and other allowances, commissions, production and regular bonuses.  Irregular bonuses, back-pay and redundancy pay are excluded.</P>
    <P>Each respondent establishment provides details of total employment, earnings and hours worked for the period in question.  For different categories of staff these returns are separately aggregated within three establishment size categories in each of 109 industrial sectors.  The overall estimates are then compiled by weighting the averages for all sample establishments in each of the cells.  The weighting used is the estimated total employment of relevant staff in each cell.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I appreciate the statistical information.  Does the Minister consider that producing information of that kind in relation to the national barometer is deceptive?  I have surveyed five companies in my area who have 5,000 employees.  The average weekly wage is £154 and these are unionised companies. I wonder whether the publication of that type of information in the newspapers is deceptive and whether it creates expectations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 56, 64, 105 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the problems for farmers in relation to the tax clearance requirement in the area of headage premia in the current year.  I am, therefore, very happy to say that at my instigation, the Government have now decided to relax the requirement in respect of applications under disadvantaged areas schemes in 1992 and 1993.  The requirement to supply the tax reference number in these cases is now being postponed to 1 January 1994.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Government's decision recognises the reality that most recipients of payments under disadvantaged areas schemes have low incomes and that additional time is needed to allow them to adjust to the new tax clearance arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision is particularly important for farmers who must lodge their 1992 sheep headage and ewe premium applications by the closing date of Friday next 6 March 1992.  I had, of course, made it clear that such applications could be submitted without the Revenue tax number in any event.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's <Col N="1451" /> announcement that the requirement to supply this tax number has been postponed for two years.  Is the Minister prepared to extend the application date? Many farmers have been confused.  I do not believe there will be a full quota of people applying before next Friday.  I would ask for another three months because of the confusion this episode has caused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 22, 24, 25, 33, 41, 46 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Since their presentation in October 1991, the detailed EC Commission's proposals have been discussed at every Council of Agriculture Ministers, including the Council on 19 November.  In mid-January the new President of the Agriculture Council, Minister E. Cunha visited Dublin where he received a detailed outline of Ireland's concerns and requirements in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy reforms.  This trip was part of a general tour of capitals by Mr. E. Cunha and arising from his various discussions he presented a brief working paper to the Council on 27 and 28 January outlining broad approaches to the reform process.  A more detailed Presidency text was presented to the Agriculture Council on 10 and 11 February.  Since then discussions at the level of Directors General from the member states have taken place in Brussels and a revised Presidency paper was tabled at the Council meeting on 2 and 3 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are still substantial differences between delegations on most elements in the reform proposals.  At a general level, the focus has been on the extent and place of the proposed price adjustments, the budgetary implications, the principles of compensation and the GATT consequences.  At specific sectoral levels <Col N="1454" /> the substantive points concern the quota proposals for milk and sheepmeat, set aside in the arable crops area, intervention arrangements for beef and the operational arrangements for premia proposed in the beef and milk sectors.  In the light of this, it is not possible to indicate when the negotiations will be concluded.</P>
    <P>The Government have agreed a negotiating position in response to the European Commission proposals.  In coming to that position full account was taken of the possible effects of the proposals on all aspects of the agriculture and food industries including rural development. In that context the quantification of the effects of Common Agricultural Policy reform in the Teagasc report as well as other such quantifications from various sources formed part of the input from my Department to the Government decision-making process.</P>
    <P>The Government are opposed to the Commission's reform proposals as they stand.  The proposals fail to meet Ireland's requirements in a number of essential areas.  We are concerned at the extent and pace of the switch from market to direct income support and I am advocating a more moderate and gradual approach.  My view and that of the Government is that, while direct payments to farmers can play an important part in income formation, it is very necessary that market price support should continue to be the principal source of farm incomes.  It is essential that realistic stocking limits are set and that our extensive grass-based livestock production system is fully protected.  A pre-condition for any reform is that adequate and durable Community finance is available to underpin the new arrangements.  Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy must also be responsive to the needs of countries such as Ireland with a heavy dependence on agriculture and should not create undue problems for aspiring entrants or new entrants to farming.</P>
    <P>Our position has been put forward in the strongest possible terms at all Council meetings at which the proposals have been discussed and in a whole series of <Col N="1455" /> bilateral meetings with Agriculture Ministers from the other member states and with Commissioner MacSharry.  Earlier this week I attended my first Agriculture Council as Minister for Agriculture and Food and I can assure this House that I took the strongest possible line in detailing Ireland's major difficulties with the reform proposals.  In the margins of the Council, I had discussions with a number of fellow Ministers and Commissioner MacSharry and left them in no doubt where I stood on this most crucial issue for Ireland.  I have already made arrangements for further bilateral meetings in the coming weeks.  Further meetings will be arranged as considered necessary by me in the light of developments.  On Sunday last I met Minister Mermaz, the French Minister for Agriculture, in Paris. Next Monday I am meeting Minister Solbes in Madrid in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>While a number of the proposals in the Presidency papers could be seen as movement in the right direction, they still do not go far enough to meet our essential requirements.</P>
    <P>The positive aspects in that paper include: an increase in the stocking rate for disadvantaged area from 1.4 livestock units per hectare to 2 livestock units per hectare for beef, dairy cow and suckler cow premia; a choice of 1990 or 1991 as reference years for sheep premium entitlement and restoration of the 1,000 head flock limit in disadvantaged areas; improved Community preference for cereals and more flexible arrangements for the operation of the accompanying measures.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Presidency's efforts, Ireland continues to have very major difficulties with the reform proposals as amended by the Presidency and they will require further significant change if they are to approach acceptability.</P>
    <P>The Portuguese paper does not adequately address many of the principal Irish concerns and we are pressing strongly for those deficiencies to be rectified. I will continue to negotiate on the detail <Col N="1456" /> of the proposals in order to ensure that a package much more acceptable to Ireland is put on the table.</P>
    <P>If and when agreement is reached, it will be necessary to ensure that adequate Community resources are provided on a permanent basis to finance the reforms. This is a vital point for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The other principal item discussed at all recent Agriculture Council meetings has been the GATT Uruguay Round. Last December the Director General of GATT, Mr. Dunkel presented a draft framework agreement covering all areas of the negotiations including agriculture to contracting parties in Geneva.  The agriculture text, in particular, has been rejected by the Community and Ministers &mdash; both Trade and Agriculture &mdash; have made it clear at a number of Council discussions that it calls into question the foundation of the Community's agricultural policy and that it is, therefore, not acceptable and has to be amended. While discussions have been continuing particularly between the EC and the US, almost all of the major difficulties remain.  If these cannot be resolved to the Community's satisfaction there will be no prospect of concluding the GATT Round.</P>

      <P>As agriculture and food account for 20 per cent of our GNP, 20 per cent of our employment and 40 per cent of our net foreign earnings, does the Minister agree that Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals alone will mean a loss of £670 million annually to the industry and to the country?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6, 17, 48 and 107 together. First, I should say I am aware of the delays in making payments and I find it difficult to make any kind of excuse for this.  The reasons for delays in payment of headage and premia grants for 1991 are many &mdash; extra work arising in relation to 1991 from the extension and reclassification of the disadvantaged areas, mistakes made in applications by many farmers, delays by applicants in replying to queries raised on their claims by my Department, and pressure on staff at local offices both from the increased work load and the huge volume of telephone and personal inquiries from applicants and others.</P>
      <P>It has never been possible under any administration to pay all headage and premia grants by the end of the calendar year to which they related.  A typical pattern has been one in which a percentage of payments is made by year's end and the remaining payments are made early in the following year.  In regard to 1991, we were committed to making as many payments as possible before the end of the year.  We succeeded reasonably well in this and, in fact, despite the problems outlined above, more headage and premia grants in respect of 1991 were paid by the end of that calendar year than were paid within the relevant year in respect of any previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are satisfied, however, that the system must be improved and this was <Col N="1460" /> one of the first issues which I addressed on becoming Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Our determination to do so has been reinforced by the fact that since the end of 1991 problems relating to the special beef premium scheme have delayed not just payments under that scheme but under all other schemes also.</P>
    <P>The EC Council of Ministers is not the appropriate forum in which to address the problems of headage and premia payments delays in Ireland.  These can best be addressed nationally.  This is why a departmental task force were set up to deal with the problems involved.  I expect to have their final report within the next two weeks.  As they have already submitted an interim report on the problems relating to the 1991 special beef premium scheme, and as I have accepted the recommendations made in that report in order to have all outstanding 1991 payments under that scheme and all other schemes completed by end of this month, I am fairly confident its final report will provide a solid basis for enabling all 1992 payments that can be made before end 1992 to be paid this year.  That is my objective and that is what I have asked my Department to do.  It is simply not good enough that farmers have to call to Deputies' offices and contact the Minister to find out when the payments for last year will be paid.</P>
    <P>I understand that the final report will include recommendations also on revised special beef premium scheme applications that can be filled more easily by all farmers.  I have asked the task force to make user-friendly forms available to farmers.  If we have schemes and there is money available we should make it easy and not more difficult for them to avail of this money.  My Department's staff are always willing to help farmers who have difficulty in completing their forms.  In relation to the specific matter raised by Deputy Deasy, his figure of 20 per cent of special beef scheme applications being disqualified cannot be accepted.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the latitude in this regard and the Minister's attempts to rectify the situation in these two particular instances.  I find that these are the two most burning issues in agriculture at present.  People have not received the money that they should have.  Let me first refer to Question No. 5.  A huge number of people are disqualified on technicalities so far as the beef premium is concerned.  The number runs into many thousands and could be as high as 20 per cent.  Dozens of the people who have come to me have been disqualified purely on technical grounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Cards which have been incorrectly marked by veterinary surgeons, and not by farmers, are the cause of the problem.  I ask the Minister to see to it that people who have been disqualified on such a technicality will be paid this premium.  I have no sympathy whatsoever for a person who makes a fraudulent claim.  I am talking here about genuine mistakes.  Second, in relation to the payment of headage grants, may I ask the Minister if he will evolve a system whereby all headage payments will be paid in the relevant year?  When I was Minister this was never an issue.  We paid part of the payment in one year and the remainder the following year, but because the situation in relation to farm incomes is so critical there is a need to get money out in the relevant year.  I ask the Minister to do this.</P>

A total of 60,500 have already been paid while 16,000 will be paid during the next few days.  This represents a figure of 84 per cent leaving just 14,000 which are under review.  I have asked my staff in the Department in cases where innocent errors have been made to pay the grants and only in those cases where a deliberate attempt has been made to defraud should they initiate an investigation or carry out a review.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that during the period January to late February of 1992 some 90 per cent of steers slaughtered at meat export plants fell into grades eligible for intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, aware that the intervention intake requirement at present, is dampening demand by factories for steers for slaughter.  The modest intervention intake arises since the European Commission is, in response to very high <Col N="1463" /> volumes being offered by the trade, applying very high rejection rates to quantities offered under the tendering system.  However, following complaints by Ireland, and a number of other member states, the Commission has undertaken to review the operation of the intervention tendering arrangements with a view to more realistic acceptance rates being applied to quantities offered. This would afford greater certainty to beef producers and have a positive effect on the overall market situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply will not be of much help to many farmers with cattle for slaughter who find themselves on a waiting list in many factories around this country.  May I ask the Minister what he is doing about this?  Has he had any meetings with factory owners?  Does he intend to have conversations with people abroad or, indeed, with the factories here to see if they are seeking out new markets and is he aware that many hundreds of farmers, who have animals for slaughter, are at present on waiting lists in factories for a month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period January-February 1992, approximately 90 per cent of steers slaughtered fell into the eligible grades while the figure for the same period in 1991 was also 90 per cent. I accept what the Deputy has said, that there is a log-jam at present.  I took the matter up with Commissioner MacSharry when I met him on Monday morning.</P>
      <P>I impressed on him the importance of getting an increased tender, particularly at this time of year, because the winter fatteners cause the greatest difficulty. There is a problem in relation to seasonality which would be more acute if we did not get an improved tender under intervention for the next two to three tenders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that the subject matter of this question has been one of the contributory causes of the low prices pertaining to cattle <Col N="1464" /> which, obviously, have horrendous consequences for farmers.  When the Minister held the position of Minister of State he was involved in a well publicised, aborted trip to Libya to open up the live cattle trade.  In view of the fact that the president of the IFA has been to Libya recently in relation to that trade, will the Minister say whether the live cattle trade will open up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really a separate question.  However, following discussions between the veterinary authorities in Ireland and Libya, a consignment of beef left for Libya.  We have received assurances that if there is no problem with that consignment of beef the live cattle trade will commence.  I agree that a resumption of the live trade to Libya would give a tremendous fillip to the cattle trade at present.  The Deputy did not ask a question in relation to Iran but my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, is out there at present trying to open up that market.</P>

They control 70 per cent of the Goodman empire because of the collapse of United Meat Packers.  There is a deliberate holding down of prices in the factories which has given rise to a serious problem in regard to winter fatteners.  Many farmers will not be in business next year unless something is done about it immediately.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Potato prices vary widely not only between north and south but throughout the island as a whole.  There are no obstacles to trade in potatoes between north and south.  Sufficient supplies are available and competition is generated through the wholesale and retail network of potato sales.  This ensures that consumers have a range of choice and they should therefore, shop around for the best value in terms of quality and price. I am, of course, concerned to ensure that consumers can readily identify the value they are receiving in respect of different sized packages and different varieties.  I have asked that particular attention be paid to this in an overall review of the grading regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister of State on his appointment.  It can be argued that there is a price variation and that the consumers in the Republic are paying a higher price than their counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, the problem does not lie with the producer.  Will the Minister admit that potato producers here face great difficulties at present in making a living from their products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to define a price variation and sometimes one is not comparing like with like.  Quality has a very great bearing in terms of the price paid for a product and it is a well established fact that some of the better quality potatoes have a low yield potential and, therefore, carry a higher production cost. Because it is a quality product, it is inevitable that their price will be at a premium, a factor which must be taken into consideration. I agree that the potato sector generally has been going through a difficult time but, in fairness, it must also be said that with the assistance of An Bord Glas they have, to a great extent, rationalised and improved the overall efficiency of the industry.  If, for example, potato <Col N="1467" /> producers in 1991-92 are in receipt of a reasonable price for their produce it should be remembered that there were many years when they were not so furtunate. I agree that it is a vulnerable industry which has been reflected in prices.  However, quality is what matters and the consumer tends to pay a little more for a quality product.</P>

      <P>The Minister has dodged the question as shoppers in Belfast are just as likely to shop for quality products as their counterparts in Dublin.  The price comparisons in <i>Choice</i> magazine between Dublin and Belfast show that the shopper in Dublin is paying 50 per cent more than the shopper in Belfast for the same quality and weight in potatoes.  Surely the Minister has a responsibility to examine why that is the case?  It is not sufficient to say that quality may have a bearing or, as a previous Minister said, that it had something to do with the change-over from the main crop to the new season's crop and that imports may have had a bearing on prices.  After all, the same imports come into Belfast and Dublin at the same time of year. There is a need for a through investigation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Indeed, Golden Wonders are perhaps superior to the two I mentioned. By comparison the product known as &ldquo;Peatlands&rdquo;, which has a very high output in terms of yield, invariably fetches a lower price on the market.  We cannot ignore quality.  I want to make a final point; we do not exercise any form of price control, we leave it to market forces to determine the value of products on the market.  At the end of the day that must be the answer from the point of view of the consumer.  There is choice, availability of products and the opportunity for the potato consumer to shop around for the best value.</P>

Investment, assisted by EC grant schemes, in the provision of modern storage facilities is a major factor in the overall development of that industry. It is my desire that we will gradually develop the industry to the extent where hopefully we will have substantial exports which will be of tremendous benefit to our farmers, particularly at this time when so many projects are being put under pressure by European regulations.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied that adequate advisory services are available to the horticulture industry?

Although I would have to say that over the last two years since the establishment of An Bord Glas under my predecessor, Deputy Seamus Kirk, the foundation has been laid for the further expansion of the horticultural industry, I agree with the Deputy that perhaps an insufficient number of farmers recognise the potential of this industry as an alternative enterprise.  Since I have come into this office I have been considering the potential for expansion in this area.  I am very pleased to hear the Deputy's point about involvement of the co-operative movement. The only way of developing horticulture is through properly organised and co-ordinated producer groups. Unfortunately the producer group structurre does not exist throughout the country. <Col N="1475" /> Therefore I intend to have discussions with the heads of the co-operative movement to see if they can motivate that structure within their own areas.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately we are not meeting the entire home market demand. It is in that area that I see potential for short term expansion, and I have replied to the question as to how we can do that. The balance of trade has been static for some time.  While we are succeeding in increasing exports of horticultural products, to some extent that is being undermined by the unacceptable level of imports.  I would advise the House that sometimes there is a misunderstanding in relation to the global figure for horticultural imports.

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the fact that the glasshouse industry is going through an exceptionally difficult time.  Indeed the Deputy has identified some of the reasons why the economics of glasshouse production of horticultural products is not very favourable, relating mainly to the high cost of energy.  As regards whether I will meet with representatives of the glasshouse industry, it is my intention to do so and I would be happy to meet with the Deputy or with any Member of this House in relation to setting up such a meeting.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be able to confirm that we are the largest exporters of mushrooms to the European market.  A very significant development has been made in this regard in recent years.  I acknowledge that my predecessor, Deputy Seamus Kirk, played a major role in this area arising from the establishment of An Bord Glas.  From my inquiries in the Department, I am satisfied that there is scope for expansion in that industry, but it is a question of phasing in an expansion of the mushroom production programme while at the same time not undermining the efforts of the existing commercial producers who have already invested a lot of money.  It is a careful balancing act to which I propose to apply myself in the months ahead.</P>

I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to intervene in an effort to arrive at a compromise in the dispute between the sugar beet growers and Greencore, formerly the Irish Sugar Company?  The sugar beet growers are only looking for a proportion of the extra money being made by the company as a result of improved technology.  Is it not fair that the growers should benefit from the increased extraction rate?  After all, it is their product.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister accept that Bandon is one of the major agricultural centres in the country; that one of the biggest, if not the biggest, marts in Ireland is in <Col N="1480" /> Bandon and that the certificate of farming courses run in Bandon have consistently had the largest numbers in the entire country?  Taking those points into account, will the Minister agree that the proposal to discontinue the farming course in Bandon is absolutely mad?  Is the Minister aware that the management proposal is to discontinue that course as from 1 April and, in the light of that, does he recognise the urgency involved? Will the Minister make it clear to the Teagasc management that the proposal is completely out of order and unacceptable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for his good wishes.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I am well aware of the importance of the Bandon centre.  In fact, there are several centres in the Cork area in which I take a special interest.  I have brought the issue to the attention of Teagasc.  I have been told that the Minister has no function regarding the detail of Teagasc courses and that the provision of certificate of farming courses in any given year at particular training centres depends upon the level of demand in the area.  I have been given to understand by Teagasc that demand in the Bandon area did not warrant the provision of a course there this year.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputy O'Keeffe that I am well aware of the issue and, notwithstanding the advice I received from Teagasc, I hope they will take account of the interest of the Deputy and myself in this centre.</P>

There was a proposal that Bandon, as a district centre, should cease to offer the course work of the certificate of farming from 1 April; it was not a question of a temporary arrangement.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind and to insist &mdash; whatever about the technicalities &mdash; that one of the most important agricultural centres in the country should not be deprived in this way.

Does the Minister share his predecessor's view that farmers have nothing better to do than drive long distances for advice?  Is the Minister aware that the Ballyjamesduff office serves some of the most extensive pig farming units in Europe, is concerned with the developments there, and the pollution problem in Lough Sheelin which has been controlled?

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Wexford):</i> The Government have given a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to review agriculture and food policies in consultation <Col N="1483" /> with the farm organisations, with a view to drawing up a national development programme for our agricultural and food sector.  The programme would, of course, take account of the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy reform and GATT negotiations and would address, among other things, the need to develop markets for value-added and &ldquo;green&rdquo; products.  A group representative of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the farm and agricultural organisations have commenced work on the programme. The group aim to complete its work in six months.

Therefore I agree with the Deputy that there is urgency for a rationalisation of the overall area.  But we must await the report of the committee established to deal with the matter.

      <Quest>if he will outline his policy objectives for the beef industry with specific reference to the producer price crisis and continuing reported difficulties in the processing section.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My main policy objective for the beef industry is to ensure that the interests of our primary producers are fully protected and that the processing sector can develop in a way that responds to market requirements.  It is within this context that I am tackling the ongoing negotiations at EC level on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which will determine the future of the beef sector for some time to come.  My aim is to obtain the best possible outcome for our producers by ensuring that the compensatory premia being proposed to offset the reduction in the intervention price are adequate and completely suitable to Irish production conditions and that the industry is encouraged to exploit market opportunities to the full.</P>
      <P>While there have been difficulties with producer prices for cattle over recent months, steer prices have held steady since the implementation of revised arrangements on processors margins for beef brought into intervention, which we negotiated at EC level last August.  This change, together with our continued reliance on intervention support, combined to prevent a major collapse in market prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since October last some 116,000 tonnes of beef have been accepted for intervention by tender in Ireland which has played a crucial role in supporting prices.  I accept that there are continuing problems being experienced by some processors.  Nonetheless, producer prices <Col N="1485" /> were stabilised and protected throughout the main slaughtering season.  As a direct response to this pressure on prices the EC Commission provided for a once-off increase in the suckler cow premium of £15.81 per head last year, which was a welcome boost for producers.  I hope that, in line with normal seasonal patterns, prices will remain firm.</P>
    <P>However, we must now begin to plan for an industry which can take most of its returns from the market rather than from intervention.  This will be a major priority in developing a national programme for the agriculture and food sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was directed to the Taoiseach but it is now directed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Spring asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in the light of considerable public concern, he will <Col N="1488" /> make a statement about the allegations on RTE television last evening that there had been political interference at the level of the Cabinet into the work of the Greencore inspectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the four Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the claim which has been made that a member of the Cabinet allegedly interfered with the investigation by the High Court-appointed inspectors into Siúicre Éireann because I was present in the RTE studios last evening when this claim was made by a journalist.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the inspectors were appointed by the High Court on 16 September 1991 on foot of an application made by me as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The application was made on foot of the very great public concern which existed at that time arising out of disclosures in relation to Siúicre Éireann and some of its related companies.  The application was the first one to be made under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>Following the commencement of the investigation I sought to be informed on its progress and to ensure that it was carried out effectively and at reasonable cost.  I had a fundamental interest in doing so as Minister for Industry and Commerce because of the pioneering nature of the investigation and because I wished to ensure that any possible wrong doing of a commercial nature which could be brought to light and dealt with through the recently enacted Companies Act should be dealt with.  My record in seeking to root out commercial wrong doing regardless of who is involved speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it is being put about by some people that I may be the subject of the allegation that the inspectors were obstructed or that some pressure was put on them to take the investigation down some particular routes and not down others.  I vehemently deny any such action on my part.  I attempted to make <Col N="1489" /> known to the inspectors on a number of occasions in November and December last my concern at the relatively slow progress which I understood was being made in the investigation and at the cost which was being incurred.  I made no secret of my concern in that regard. Counsel on my behalf informed the High Court in open court on 13 December 1991, almost three months after the investigation had commenced, of my grave concern at the time being taken and at the costs being incurred in the investigation.  My concerns in that regard were reasonable and they could not in any way be construed as being interference with the inspectorate or as obstruction of any of the investigation. In fact, the High Court last month commented that my concerns were reasonable.</P>
    <P>I was present in the RTE studios last evening when the latest claim of interference with the inspectors was made.  I asked the journalist who made that allegation, privately after the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, what Minister he was referring to, but he refused to say. The journalist concerned had written on this subject previously in an article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 9 February 1992 claiming that the inspectors were subjected to pressure, to interference or harassment by a Government Minister.  I am also conscious that the journalist concerned has on two previous occasions stated that I sought to support the opposition to the publication of the second interim report made by the inspectors, an allegation which is wholly wrong &mdash; the record will show that I have always sought the immediate publication of all these reports.  What I find most objectionable, if these allegations are supposed to refer to me, is the claim that pressure was brought to bear on the inspectors so that the investigation should not go down particular routes.  In this context the statement was made that the inspectors did not interview the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, with the inference that this was due to whatever pressure was being applied to the inspectors.  I hope it will be clear to <Col N="1490" /> everyone, based on my record, that not only is it untrue that I applied such pressure, but that it is also incredible.  My record speaks of the pursuit of the truth wherever it leads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said is very interesting and one could not object to it but he is not answering the question which I put to the Taoiseach.  A charge was made on a television programme last night that a Minister of the present Government interfered with the direction in which the inquiry was going. The Minister said that he questioned the journalist afterwards in private and he denied having a role in the affair and did that also on television last night.  If the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, is not responsible for this pressure, evidently some other Minister of the Government is.  We know that journalists generally protect their sources and therefore there is no point in questioning the journalist. There are two people who can tell whether what is being said is true.  Did the Minister question the two people involved, Mr. Foley and Mr. Barry, as to whether they had made these charges of harassment and that a Minister was seeking to direct them in a certain direction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>After what I heard in the House this morning I considered telephoning Mr. Barry and/or Mr. Foley, but on reflection I decided not to, lest that be construed as a form of harassment of them.  If the inspectors were to find on reading my reply to these questions today that any aspect of it is in any way untrue, they are free to make a statement to that effect.  So far as other Members of the Government are concerned, I want to make it clear that while I can only speak for myself with certainty, I have no reason to believe that any other member of the Government was involved in the alleged activities that are complained about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reason he belatedly became concerned about the cost of this inquiry was because the inquiry was a costly error and should have been carried out by a committee of this House, the House of representatives, as laid down in the Constitution?  Would the Minister further say, since when, and what precedent is there, for a member of the Executive to interfere with the court or the agents appointed by the courts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that I had belatedly become concerned about the cost of this inquiry.  That is not so.  I became concerned about the cost of the inquiry about a month after it was established, when I learned that it was proposed to pay a certain level of fees to the inspectors.  Although presumably the inspectors did not consider the fees to be very high I considered them to be very high indeed and I became concerned particularly at what the total cost would be if the investigation was prolonged.  It is not correct to say that I became belatedly concerned.  The Deputy also asked why this investigation was not carried out by the Oireachtas.  I know of no procedure whereby that could have been done.  The investigation related to an alleged commercial corporate wrongdoing.  There is provision set out in Part II of the Companies Act 1990 to investigate such matters as this.  That was the point of the Oireachtas passing that legislation. Deputy Mitchell asked if there was precedent for agents of the Executive interfering with the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In stating that he has no reason to believe that any other member of the Government made approaches to the inspectors concerned, did the Minister specifically ask the Taoiseach &mdash; to whom my question was addressed but which was diverted to the Minister &mdash; who has overall responsibility for what Ministers do, whether either he or any member of the Government made approaches to the inspectors?  Does the Minister have any powers whatsoever in relation to the documents which are alleged to have been deposited by the inspectors which are alleged to have been proof that there was interference other than the inquiries he made or that pressure was applied to the inspectors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned for the sos I was trying to establish with the Minister the need to increase revenue from the licences.  I said that it was obviously quite scandalous that there were 700,000 dogs and that only 170,000 licence fees were collected.  If there are 700,000 dogs and each of them is licensed for a £10 fee, the income would amount to about £7 million.  That is leaving aside the extra revenue to be derived under various regulations in this Bill.  I would imagine that £7 million would completely fund the dog warden service.  I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fairly common feature of modern life that parents like to have a small dog for their children.  Dogs can be very beneficial for children in terms of their development.  I would hate to see any imposition on parents in buying a dog for their children. They should not have to pay an exhorbitant sum.  Would it not make more sense in respect of pets for children for the Minister to put in place a procedure whereby licences at the current rate could be collected?  Obviously a large number of dogs are unlicensed.  It would be better to leave the fee as it is and make sure that those fees outstanding are collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Garland's sums are right.  I would be extremely happy if we <Col N="1542" /> were in a position to collect licences from all dog owners.  It is estimated that there are about 750,000 dogs in the country, a large proportion of whom are totally uncared for and straying, having no real homes.  I do not know the exact number of dog owners who provide for, understand and treat a dog as man's best friend. If we were dealing only with dog owners who loved and cared for their dogs we would not need new legislation.  There is, however, a real problem which we are addressing.</P>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 4 would be to remove the power to change the level of fees by regulation.  That is not generally acceptable.  It would mean that the fees would remain at the level set in the Act until such time as a new Bill was brought before the Oireachtas.  It is not reasonable to suggest that the time of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be taken up by a Bill simply to up-date licence fees.  The licence fee was last increased in 1984 and we are making provision here to increase it from £5 to £10.  That figure appears to be acceptable.</P>
      <P>From the discussions I have had in the limited time which has been available, relating to such matters as more responsible dog ownership, it is clear that there is a need to enhance and improve the dog warden service in order to eliminate problems.  I hope that the additional funds will make this possible.  Those funds are being devoted exclusively to the improvement of that service.  The local authorities must make their own arrangements. They have been struggling to cope with this problem and I expect that the new resources will assist them.  However, it is essential that we try to find new and different means to increase substantially the number of dog owners whose dogs are licensed.  We must have a more equitable and fairer scheme to address this question. That is my desire and intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To exclude from the Bill the possibility of increasing the licence fee at some future date would be undesirable.  It might be necessary in, say, five years to increase the fee for a particular type of breed causing a problem for the warden service.  The vast majority of breeds do <Col N="1543" /> not create a problem but a number do. The Bill provides the freedom to consider increasing the licence fee in such instances.  In respect of other legislation, Deputies have often asked why it should be necessary to come back to the House to make provisions of that type, saying that it should have been included in the original legislation.  There is no intention to impose further increases in the licence fee in the immediate future.  The provision is flexible and avoids the necessity to come back to the House should the occasion arise.  There has been no division on this type of issue in respect of other Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely amazed at the Minister's response.  I know he is new in the job and we cannot blame him for the failures of numerous predecessors. The principal Act dates back to 1986 and the whole principle of dog licences goes back a lot further.  The Minister is saying that responsible dog owners will buy the licence and if other people will not buy a licence what can we do about it.  It is the Minister's job to do something about it.  He is admitting that there are perhaps 500,000 unlicensed dogs, many of which are not under control and the ownership of which is very uncertain.  This is the problem with which this Bill should be dealing.  We must have a compulsory national identification scheme which is computerised.  This would make it easy to ascertain whether a licence has been purchased for a particular dog.  It would facilitate the dog wardens and any dogs not properly identified could be taken away immediately.  I think they are doing that at present.</P>
      <P>I am not at all impressed by the Minister's response and I would ask him to think again.  This is a very serious matter and it is not being adequately addressed.</P>

      <P>As I am standing in temporarily on this Bill and I am not <i>au fait</i> with what has already been said by my colleagues in relation to this section my view would be that we should not create too many barriers for people <Col N="1544" /> in the matter of licensing their dogs.  I am not arguing about the increased fee for a general dog licence because those concerned are involved in a commercial way but for domestic pets the lower the barriers in relation to the registration of dogs the better.  Obviously, the more people who license their dogs the more knowledge there is as to who owns dogs and who is responsible for them.  To this end the licence fee should be nominal.  While £10 per year for most of us in this House is not a huge sum of money, for many families in areas where there is the highest population of stray dogs income levels are such that £10 is a significant amount.  For that reason I argue that the Minister should look at the question of increasing that figure across the board and see whether he should proceed with such a move or whether there should be some alleviation for people in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The amendment tabled in the names of Deputies Gilmore and McCartan relates to how licence fees will be fixed in the future and asks that regard be had to the size, weight and breed of dog and to the use for which a dog is kept.  If that amendment were included in the section proposed by the Minister I would have no problem with him having the right to impose the fees without coming back to the House.  It is important to bear in mind the range of uses to which dogs are put. My concern is to protect the householder, and to ensure that greater responsibility is accepted for the family pet, that they are well cared for and that the great value they are for children is utilised to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>If we go down the road of using the licence fee as a revenue earner we undermine the concept of trying to get control of dogs in a way which ensures they are properly cared for, properly registered and marked.</P>

      <P>I should like to say to Deputy Garland that it may be popular to suggest that everyone who owns a dog in Ireland is going to be responsible and is going to be a good dog owner but I am in this House to face reality, not dreams. <Col N="1545" /> I am certain that, regrettably, a large number of the people in this country today who own dogs do not care for them, allow them to stray, are not interested in controlling them, and do not take the appropriate steps to ensure controlled breeding of their animal by way of proper accommodation, veterinary attention, management and so on.  I do not want this taken out of context in such a deliberate way as Deputy Garland has chosen to do on this occasion.  That is not to suggest that I am not interested in getting every person in this country who can afford it, and where it is legitimate for them to do so, to pay a dog licence fee. If it were possible for every dog owner in this country to face that reality and I saw that I would go after it the same as the Deputy but I know it is not real and I will not tell the House it is real.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy De Rossa's question there is no point in setting out to have a very complex licence fee system for dogs.  The argument put forward in the amendment is that there should be flexibility, having regard to the size, weight and breed of dog and to the use for which the dog is kept.  There is much to be said about &ldquo;the use for which the dog is kept&rdquo;.  If one takes the first part of the amendment it is possible to have an old age pensioner with little means who could have a very heavy pet dog and of a breed which might cause problems for other people but not for him or his neighbours. I want to ensure that in drafting the regulations I do not hurt an owner in such circumstances.  I do not favour a complex licence fee system.  Suffice it to say there is a certain amount of room for scope which can take account of problems which have been referred to and I will do my best to meet those legitimate requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled an amendment. I have listened with interest to the Minister's contribution.  I had asked him to give the official explanation of section <Col N="1546" /> 3 (c).  The words and the language used make the section all-embracing.  In reply to Deputy Garland the Minister said that because there may be stray dogs or accidents of birth in the canine breeds it would be wrong to define the provision, that we can easily cater for this matter by regulation.  I accept that but all the language in this section has a particular meaning and I would like to know the Department's thinking on it.  When we tabled the amendment we were concerned that the section spoke for the totality.  Many people have told me they would be prepared to pay £50 for a licence for the lifetime of a dog.  I do not know whether they informed the Minister or the officials in the Department of that.  There would be an economic benefit involved in such a move in so far as the wardens would be eliminated.  I presume the 170,000 people will continue to pay their licence fees as they have done heretofore unless the increased fee results in a reduction in licensing.  I would ask the Minister when replying to this section to outline the reason this all-embracing language is used.  It can mean all sorts of different things to different people. When the Minister has gone on to greener pastures the person who succeeds him may get different advice from different officials in the Department and more draconian measures may be used. That is what we are trying to address.  We are not trying to inhibit good order and the administration of this legislation.</P>

      <P>First, the licence fees were set in 1984.  Everyone who contributed this morning said they would like to see the warden service improved.  Particular reference was made to Dublin city and county where there are seven wardens. One of the problems that we encountered in the past was that we were not prepared to face up to reality and meet the cost of that service.  The increased licence fees will, I hope, enable us to improve the service throughout the country.  In this context, a much higher percentage of those who own dogs at present will have to pay their licence fees.  As I said, I will be anxious to have discussions with the <Col N="1547" /> local authorities to see what steps can be taken to ensure this happens.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey's proposition, that dog owners be allowed purchase a licence covering a three, five or ten year period, sounds plausible and I will look at it to see if this can be done but we should bear one or two points in mind.  It was put to me strongly that each person should pay the same amount in respect of each dog, that the general dog licence presented some people with an opportunity to pay somewhat less in aggregate and in order to be fair the same amount should be paid in respect of each dog.  Deputy Carey's proposition seems to put that concept in jeopardy.  It would also present us with a problem of assessing what the lifespan of a dog might be but given that this is the second time the Deputy has mentioned this problem I am prepared to look at his suggestion before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy, in relation to cash flow, that for local authorities each year stands on its own and because money is paid in advance does not mean that local authorities would be in any stronger position in dealing with their problems three or four years hence. Indeed, it could lead to false expectations being created.  I am prepared, however, to see if I can meet the Deputy's wishes in this regard.  I am not too sure, however, if I will be successful.</P>

      <P>As I said this morning in regard to the regulations which will be drawn up following the passage of the Bill, I will continue to have the widest possible consultations to ensure we find a good solution to the problems facing us.  If time permits, and the Whips agree, I would have no objection to having a further discussion at a later stage on the regulations.  As far as I am aware, this is not the normal practice but that would not deter me from having discussions at any time to either improve the legislation or regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to prolong the debate on the matter but, as I said, the normal practice in regard to legislation which comes before the House is to provide for regulations which, unless they are annulled by a motion of the House, automatically become law.  Due to the way Standing Orders operate here a motion can only be brought forward in Private Members' time.  For all practical purposes, regulations cannot be annulled in this House.  I ask the Minister therefore to consider making regulations by way of <Col N="1549" /> a positive order; in other words, they would have to be approved by the House. This could be done in a short debate on a Friday morning or afternoon.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one further point. I asked earlier that we would not create obstacles to the registration and licensing of dogs particularly the family pet.  The Minister referred in particular to the old age pensioners who keep a pet for company or simply to bark and frighten away people whom they might regard as intruders.  This is as much the case in rural areas as it is in urban areas.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, in making regulations, he should, as in the case of licences for televisions, consider giving them to old age pensioners free of charge.  This would not result in a great loss of revenue to the State or interfere with the service it is hoped to provide. Indeed, by so doing he would provide much security for old age pensioners who, as we are aware, feel increasingly under threat in our modern society.</P>

      <P>Man's inhumanity to man or woman does not always stop there; it can often extend to animals, especially dogs.  There is need, therefore, for regulations and legislation to control dogs. However, the Minister is looking for excessive powers and that has not been dealt with adequately.  I support the suggestion made by Deputy De Rossa that the Minister should consider granting old age pensioners a free dog licence. Old people often get muddled when it comes to filling forms with the result that many of us spend long hours filling them out for them.  This is a regulation they could do without.  The law requires them to have a dog licence but this is more often ignored.  This would be one less form for old people to fill up.  This suggestion would be of help to them financially and would amount to a compassionate and humanitarian gesture.</P>

      <P>Any Minister would like to make the kind of concessions which have been sought.  However, it is difficult enough to be Minister for the Environment without taking on the functions of the Minister for Social Welfare as well. The sum of £10 for a dog licence is a very tiny part of the total cost of keeping, maintaining and looking after a dog for a year.  As I said on Second Stage, it is surprising that people are reluctant to pay for a television or a dog licence &mdash; they seem to have a mental block in this regard &mdash; but they do not seem to mind paying other charges.  The increase we are seeking is the first since 1984.  I have not had complaints from any groups in regard to the proposed increase.  Indeed, I would go as far as to say &mdash; I am quite sure my colleagues will agree &mdash; that old age pensioners are the highest percentage of contributors in the sense that they pay their licences.  I could be wrong but I am prepared to bet that, in the context of those who pay their licence, they constitute a very significant number.</P>
      <P>The reason for having new resources is to enhance the dog warden service. Many of the groups representing dog owners are extremely anxious to have an efficient service.  We cannot argue for concessions and at the same time expect me &mdash; or a local authority &mdash; to improve the warden services.  Earlier this morning we discussed the number of wardens in Dublin city and county and other places. The service is stretched to the limit and if there is any possibility of improving it we must face up to the reality of increasing the licence and making sure that dog owners who are not paying their licences at present are obliged to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> In page 3, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) the addition of the following new subsection:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(3) All proceeds from general dog licence or dog licences shall be assigned for the puroses of the control and welfare of dogs, including the costs of regulation, dog wardens and the provision of dog control centres and facilities.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We covered this matter on numerous occasions this morning and we said that all the fees would be devoted to the warden service.  In that context the amendment is unnecessary as already there is provision in the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, that the fees in respect of a dog licence and a general dog licence are repayable to the local authority which issue them.  At the moment licences are issued and fees collected by An Post under arrangements agreed with local authorities.  The fees are passed on by An Post to the local authorities concerned after deduction of a set sum to cover the administrative cost of An Post.</P>
      <P>In practice, local authorities spend far more on their dog control services than they collect in licence fees.  The increase in dog licence fees, provided for in the Bill, will give much needed additional resources to local authorities to fund their dog control services and will enable a greater level of enforcement to be applied.  It is likely to be a long time before local authorities make a surplus on dog control operations, but, if they do, they should have discretion on how to use such surplus within their revenue generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's assurances with regard to the current operation of the law are welcome.  I have no doubt that the motives of those who tabled the amendment arise from their experiences at local authority level <Col N="1553" /> throughout the country of the way in which the Department of the Environment appear to be eroding the powers and responsibilities of local authorities generally on the one hand and laying down legislation and regulations &mdash; as, for example, in this area &mdash; where the local authorities simply do not have the resources available to them to carry out their responsibilities.  At present, Dublin City Council, of which I am a member, are down something in the order of £60 million on what they should be since the rates support grant was introduced in 1977 in the wake of the abolition of domestic rates.  That is the scale on which Dublin City Council have lost in terms of funding to carry out the services which they are expected to provide on behalf of their citizens.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be supported in the general thrust of what is happening in attempting to deal with the problem of stray, wandering and vicious dogs. However, the problem is twofold: the first is that inadequate funds are made available to local authorities to carry out their functions in this area.  I illustrated graphically earlier on in the debate how poorly off Dublin city and county are in this regard.  There is a trend, when there is frustration at the level of service in Dublin or elsewhere, to criticise the Minister. The not uncommon reaction of the Department is to issue a directive, take over responsibility and regulate the matter directly, including the spending of money.  I do not want to digress too far but, by way of illustration, there is a ludicrous situation in Dublin regarding the collection of parking meter charges which Dublin Corporation collect, on a day to day, meter for meter basis round our streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sum in the region of £4.5 million in an account held by Dublin Corporation on behalf of the Minister from this meter collection which we are not allowed to spend.  The Minister will not release the moneys even though there is a crying need for traffic management and planning in the city.  If a provision as explicit as this is not written into our legislation I am worried that at some <Col N="1554" /> future date it will be possible, either through ministerial directive, regulation or whim, to divert the resources from the local authority to the Minister who will then run the dog service from the Department.</P>
    <P>This is particularly worrying when one bears in mind that all but three local authorities employ the services of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to carry out their functions under the legislation.  The prospect of a Minister in a Department running this service, through a national association, for 90 per cent of the country is all too appealing.  At present the three dog wardens in Dublin city are pleading with the ISPCA to provide basic equipment to enable them to deal with vicious animals.  However, the ISPCA are not adequately pursuing their interests because there are ideological reservations about, for example, the use of tranquilisers or certain equipment to overpower vicious animals.  While this merry-go-round is going on the people of Dublin are left as it were at the mercy of stray and vicious animals.  As I said, dog wardens have suspended all their activities in the control of stray and dangerous animals for the past two weeks.</P>
    <P>We are not prepared to walk away from this amendment as quickly as the Minister would like us to do.  It is important to write into the legislation an emphatic declaration that all the proceeds from dog licences will be earmarked for the dog warden service.  As I said earlier, the dog warden service is the key to the effective operation of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 (1) of the 1986 Control of Dogs Act provides:</P>
      <P>The following fees shall be payable to a local authority in respect of the issue of a dog licence or a general licence, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in respect of the issue of a dog licence, a fee of £5, and</P>
      <P>(b)  in respect of the issue of a general dog licence, a fee of £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> Therefore, if I wanted, theoretically, to put my hands on this money, which I have no intention of doing, it is clear that the Act provides for the payment of the licence fee directly to the local authority. The 1991 Local Government Act prescribes certain functions for the Minister for the Environment in the devolution of further powers to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I ask the Deputy to examine his amendment and the ultimate logic in it. It proposes that if we reach a stage where there is a theoretical surplus to the local authorities from dog licences against their needs in terms of the provision of the warden service, they could, in certain circumstances, use these resources for other purposes as they saw fit.  We need to face reality.  We are so far away from meeting the financial requirements of the warden service from the income from dog licences that I do not want to think about it at this stage.  I think it is fair to say that the legal provision which will ensure that the local authority have control of these financial resources is not in doubt.  If the position should arise that they have surplus resources from dog licences, which I believe is unthinkable at the moment, they will also have the right under local autonomy, to do as they see fit with these resources.</P>

      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution in subsection (1) of `on a lead or chain while in public places' for `under effectual control'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with what I regard as a rather nebulous phrase in section 9 of the 1986 Act which requires people <Col N="1556" /> who escort dogs in public places to have them &ldquo;under effectual control&rdquo;.  This provision is open to many different interpretations. It is suggested that a more appropriate and definite definition should be used which would enable the dog warden service to deal, in a more definite way, with people who escort dogs in public places.  This would ensure that there would not be scope for debate in a public place as to what is effectual control. This amendment proposes to delete the phrase &ldquo;under effectual control&rdquo; from the 1986 Act and substitute the term &ldquo;on a lead or chain while in public places&rdquo;.  I believe this wording is used by the Minister elsewhere in the Bill. Therefore, it should apply in this instance also.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Deputy has said about the different interpretations of the phrase &ldquo;under effectual control&rdquo;.  A dog owner who is walking his dog in a public place could say he had his dog under effectual control but that certain things happened.  I accept that in such circumstances there could be a problem with the interpretation of the term &ldquo;under effectual control&rdquo;.  However, if we impose a requirement on dog owners to have their dogs on a chain or lead at all times when they are in public places we are effectively saying to dog owners that they cannot exercise their dogs.  This could give rise to serious problems.  I should like to hear the Minister's comment on that point.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to know how far we should go in this instance and how flexible we should be.  We must remember that we are dealing with people who have very dangerous dogs which they use to intimidate people.  As Deputy Durkan said, these young muscular men who <Col N="1557" /> have these dangerous dogs on leads are very intimidating.  I believe even Mike Tyson would be intimidated if he was confronted by one of these young men with a big dog.  This happens mainly in cities rather than in rural areas.  One has to wonder what these young men are doing with these big dogs because they do not look as if they are exercising them. Can we stop these people from walking their dogs if they have a lead on them?  I often wonder if these young men think these dogs give them a status in the community and make people notice them.  At one time dogs were known as the poor man's flock, especially among travelling people.  These people have given a new meaning to this.  At the same time we have to take into consideration the ordinary people who merely like to take their dogs for a walk.  Therefore, I believe it is difficult to find wording which will cover all dog owners, the majority of whom are genuine dog lovers and the small minority who use dangerous dogs for a different purpose.  I have some sympathy for the Minister in this respect.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. We have to remember that we are talking about two different types of dog owners.  People who walk their dogs on Dún Laoghaire pier, for example, where many people and families go for walks, should be required to have their dogs on a lead.  Dogs that run wild frighten children and adults.  When dog owners are told they should have their dogs under control they get very aggressive and annoyed and do nothing about it. Perhaps dogs should be kept on a lead in built-up areas, in parks or at piers, but it would be unrealistic to expect people in the country to bring their dogs for a walk to always have them on a lead.  When I take my dogs to the beach I do not always keep them on a lead because they are small and harmless dogs.  It should be obligatory in certain areas to keep dogs on a lead and it should not be up to the individual to decide whether to do so.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> There are two matters to be considered <Col N="1558" /> here: the type of dog involved and where one is walking the dog.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Many dog owners have very little garden space or land and the question of restricting dogs in all public places is unacceptable.  There must be some freedom in public parks, walkways and piers to exercise dogs.  The amendment is not acceptable because it would impose an unduly severe restriction on all dog owners or persons in charge of a dog when in a public place.  The term &ldquo;under effectual control&rdquo; allows the person accompanying a dog to keep it on a chain or lead or under voice command. There is little demand for the leashing and chaining of dogs when in all public places.</P>
      <P>Under the new section 19 there is power to make regulations providing for the control of dogs.  This power can be used to make provision for specific types or classes of dogs.  Furthermore local authorities may, under section 17 of the 1986 Act, make by-laws relating to the control of dogs within their functional areas and these by-laws may specify areas within which dogs must be leashed or may be be excluded.  In reply to Deputy Liam Fitzgerald's request, local authorities are in a position to meet that requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty about the overall proposal is that it fails to take account of the fact that a huge number of dogs present little or no problem whether on a lead or not.  The purpose of the Bill in essence is to control dangerous dogs and to protect the public safety.  We do not want to interfere in a broad way with the good <Col N="1559" /> management of dogs either by way of lead, voice control or whatever.  A variety of measures of control do not involve the essential requirement of having a dog on a lead or a chain.  This amendment would impose a huge burden on a great number of dog owners whose dogs are no threat to the public and therefore it is unacceptable. The existing provisions cover the matter adequately.</P>
    <P>In relation to other provisions which involve regulations governing muzzling and matters of that kind it would be a great step forward if we could ensure that all breeds of dogs that normally tend to be dangerous or have caused problems are kept on a lead.  That would solve many problems, but to take the matter any further is a bit much.  It is unnecessary and would result in many objections from the general body of dog owners whose dogs are harmless and cause no problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting down to the nub of the issue.  I do not wish to argue with Deputy Fennell about her little dogs but small dogs can be as much of a menace and a threat as big dogs. They may run underneath people's feet tripping them, and be a danger to children as well as adults.  The fundamental proposition is that a dog in a public place should be on a leash.  As regards the exercising of dogs, one must pose the question whether the urban environment is the place to have a dog.</P>
      <P>I was born in Dublin but reared in a rural environment and my family always owned dogs.  I have a great love for dogs but I would refuse to have a dog in the city because it is an entirely inappropriate environment in which to keep a dog. There is a requirement in all public parks that dogs be kept on a leash.  It is against the by-laws and regulations that dog owners let their dogs run free in these parks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion for my amendment stems from the difficulty of the dog warden service in dealing with this problem. When dog wardens approach people with an over active animal that poses a threat to people who are lawfully in a public <Col N="1560" /> place the argument arises as to what is and what is not effectual control.  Some people consider that because dogs who run ahead of their owner and perhaps worry passers by are within a whistle call of the owner, that is effectual control, but I do not believe it is.  The dog warden service find particular difficulty with the operation of this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the original legislation attempted to address the concerns expressed by my constituency colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, about the right to exercise dogs.  The Minister said local authorities may regulate for this.  Similar debates have taken place in Dublin City Council and councillors have suggested that sections of our larger public parks be designed for the purpose of dog exercise. However, there is a problem of resources.  The finances are not available to construct fences that would separate areas.  The House has discussed the problem before.  Sections 9 (1) (b) and (c) of the principal Act provide that the premises of any person &mdash; which, in the context of the legislation, may include a body corporate or a statutory body &mdash; may be used with the consent of that person. Dublin Corporation, for example, could consent to members of the public taking their dogs to designated areas or portions of a property to run loose.  The onus is on dog wardens to find someone with a property large enough and who will give the dog owner permission to run his or her dogs over the land.  As I understand it, the idea is that, because there is a risk and a worry in connection with dangerous dog breeds, straying animals and dogs running free in public places, legislation is required for control purposes.  Primarily, we rely upon the dog warden service to implement the legislation.  A major difficulty arises when phrases such as &ldquo;broad spaces&rdquo; and &ldquo;under effective control&rdquo; are contained in the legislation.</P>
    <P>That issue fits into another concern of mine that will be debated later in the legislation, time permitting, that is, my concern about the muzzling of dogs.  I am opposed in principle to the concept of muzzling dogs, irrespective of breed.  I believe that that practice is inhumane and <Col N="1561" /> that it is not an appropriate way to seek to control and regulate animals.  Therefore, I would push for a much wider requirement to keep dogs on a leash in public places.  That is the way to deal with the threat presented by dogs bred for aggressive purposes or dogs that could be a potential worry to innocent passers-by on a public way, because of either their size or their appearance.  Those animals should be required to be on a leash and under the control of a responsible person. If that were the position then by and large the problem in relation to the different breeds nominated under the 1991 Regulations would not arise.</P>
    <P>For reasons that I shall go into later, I do have worries about the way in which the muzzling of a dog will react on the animal itself, about the way in which it will create a reaction from people to the animal carrying the muzzle and about other different aspects.  I do not consider that muzzling is the way to resolve worries about different breeds or types of animal.  My interest is in trying to introduce a general principle that dogs, irrespective of size, breed or disposition, once in a public place, must be on a lead. It should then be a matter for owners of private property or statutory bodies with charge over public places to regulate how and where dogs may be exercised and to run free.</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways.  The Minister cannot argue on the one hand, as he did earlier today, that we have a problem with difficult dogs and difficult people who have difficult dogs, and then on the other hand say that we should provide that little dogs, in-between size dogs and nice dogs should be allowed to run free.  The dog warden service simply cannot cope with that kind of chaos. There has to be clarity and there has to be one rule for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McCartan that we are coming to the nub of the Bill.  There are difficulties in framing legislation to cover all eventualities. It does not make sense to legislate for the muzzling of certain breeds of dogs without going after delinquent owners &mdash;<Col N="1562" /> those are the people whom we should try to identify in legislation.  I shall give one very brief example.  A journalist for <i>The Irish Times</i>, Mr. Dermot Kerry, in an article about the Bill two days ago in &ldquo;An Irishman's Diary&rdquo;, caught the kernel of the difficulty faced by both sides of the House in an illustration that the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, would be interested in.  I quote from his article:</P>
      <P>The regulations might have gone unnoticed but for Mrs. Beth Sherrard, a Cork woman, who was challenged about her unmuzzled German Shepherd, whom she was walking near her home.  She promptly told the garda she did not intend to put a muzzle on him. It landed her in court, and she said she would go to prison rather than pay a fine.</P>
      <P>At the same time a little Dalmatian in Limerick being treated by a local vet bit off the vet's ear.  That is an illustration that the House might consider: on the one hand, a German Shepherd walking peacefully along the road and on the other hand, a little Dalmatian behaving very viciously.  It is almost impossible to enact blanket legislation to cover all eventualities.</P>
      <P>Essentially, it is the deliquent and bad owners of dogs who are at fault.  We should identify those people and make it impossible for them to practice their nefarious breeding, training and use of dangerous animals.  That should be the object of this whole exercise; we should not penalise well-meaning innocent people who are going about their lawful business and who get great solace and satisfaction from their animals.  It is very difficult for the House to target what we want to achieve.  There is a consensus between both sides of the House; our difference is in the best way to frame the wording of various provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the very beginning that I had a measured and flexible response to the problem.  Deputy Kemmy in both his most recent and his earlier contributions teased out the difficulties. However, to introduce into the Dáil a <Col N="1563" /> Bill designed to identify problem owners would be equally difficult.</P>
      <P>On occasions in the past Deputy McCartan and I have crossed swords in the House when debating legislation.  The Deputy says that I am blowing hot and cold.  As clearly as I can, I want to indicate that that is not the case.  If we were to assume for a moment that the Deputies' amendment were accepted, then we would have the spectacle of a farmer pushing 50 cows down a road, assisted by a sheep dog on a lead.  Deputy Fennell seemed to take account of the different problems experienced in various parts of the country in relation to an absolute requirement that one must have a dog on a lead in a public place.  It would be unthinkable for the House to try to force a farmer to manage a herd of cattle or a flock of sheep with a dog on a lead.  That is just one example to demonstrate that I am not blowing hot and cold.  There are practical problems involved in going absolutely in that direction.</P>
      <P>The general tenor of Deputy McCartan's comments about keeping dogs on a lead in public places and in built-up areas makes a great deal of sense.  However, I accept that many owners of numerous breeds of dogs are able to manage their dogs excellently by voice control and other means.  I know people very experienced in the management of dogs and their management could not be bettered and I would not seek to impose another directive on such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have absolute discretion to select sites or parts of parks for which by-laws would require that dogs be admitted only if on a leash.  I accept that that is a matter for the local authorities. My job is to endeavour to frame legislation which takes account of that possibility, which takes account of the general requirement outlined by Deputy McCartan, which takes account of owners who are in a position to manage and control their dogs without doing that, which takes account of the farming position as well nationwide where, to oblige a dog owner to have a dog leashed while managing <Col N="1564" /> a sheep or cattle herd would not be practical.  For these and many other reasons I cannot agree to the amendment. It is not hot; it is not cold; it is just for real.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Perhaps we should turn down the temperature somewhat in the manner in which we are addressing the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister has addressed one difficulty that had not crossed my mind.  Would the Minister accept that there is at least a different set of considerations to be applied to an urban, built-up, area as opposed to rural areas?  I accept the point the Minister made about a farmer who must go about his business on the highway, to conduct his animals, using a sheepdog or a farmyard dog.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that real differences and problems arise in urban areas.  I am not coming in here with some type of high-faluting problem I have picked simply to entertain the Minister or anyone else.  This arises directly from our examination experience, at city council level, of the way in which the dog warden service operates in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister be disposed to examine for Report Stage, this amendment and the problem I seek to address here?  Would he consider looking at section 9 (1) of the Principal Act and address it in a general sense by laying down a proviso&mdash;where it is said: &ldquo;unless such owner or the person in charge of the dog accompanies it and keeps it under effectual control&rdquo;&mdash; including in urban areas the necessity to employ the use of a leash, etc?  Certainly in the urban constituency I represent I would not predict any objection on the part of the broad community to such a stricture, as it is generally accepted that people in urban areas who have dogs, who take them out into public places, should be obliged to have them on a leash.  That would be a reasonable approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to press my amendment if the Minister is disposed to examining this aspect again for Report Stage along the general lines I have suggested <Col N="1565" /> or, indeed, any other line that would better suggest itself to him or his officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain amount of logic in what Deputy McCartan says. At the same time, when one thinks of it in pure legislative terms from a national point of view, the only mechanism obtaining to deal with the diversity of problems that emerge are the by-laws. As I see it, local authorities are the instruments for the effective discharge of that function.  We are viewing this as ordinary politicians endeavouring to cover the ambit of the types of problems encountered generally.  Therefore, it is necessary to keep it broad and general.  Probably we are not now addressing some of the more tedious problems that can arise in urban or rural areas.</P>
      <P>I gave one reason off the top of my head for not going in the direction advocated by Deputy McCartan.  Indeed, the Deputy's desires are properly met within the existing framework, the by-laws within local authority areas covering urban areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but all a local authority can do is regulate with regard to their parks and public spaces but they cannot regulate with regard to a public road or highway.</P>

      <Col N="1566" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 11 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (2) of &lsquo;without a warrant&rsquo; after &lsquo;dwelling&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a basic amendment of the Principal Act not dealt with in the Bill and deals with the power of wardens to pursue stray dogs under the provisions of section 11 of the Principal Act.  Section 11 (1) of the Principal Act reads:</P>
      <P>A dog warden shall take all reasonable steps to seize and detain any dog that appears to him to be a stray dog and he may enter any premises (other than a dwelling) for the purposes of such seizure and detention.</P>
      <P>The problem for the dog warden service is that, as the legislation is framed, if while pursuing an escaping dog it enters private property, they must have a warrant to enable them to enter the property. Their difficulty is that they must then head off, find a member of the Garda, or a Peace Commissioner and pursue the animal some hours, or perhaps even days, with a court warrant authorising them to enter on the private property. That makes a nonsense of the way in which these legislative provisions can be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reservations even about the qualifications obtaining in the Principal Act of excluding dwellings.  Nonetheless I appreciate that balances must be struck in all legislation in regard to the inviolability of the home and whatever else. Indeed, the spectacle of the lazy dog owner can be observed frequently, walking to the front gate of their house, giving the poor brute a kick on the backside telling it to go off down the road for the exercise Deputy Liam Fitzgerald says such animals so badly need.  In the interim, the owner props himself or herself against a pillar of the house, keeping <Col N="1567" /> a lazy eye on the animal while in sight and, after a while, might whistle to bring it back home.  Clearly if a dog warden or any other authority should appear on the horizon, the animal will be whistled back home, put under lock and key of the dwelling environs.  Nothing can be done; the warden must scratch his head and move on.</P>
    <P>On account of that not too frequent scenario I would have reservations even about this qualification of exempting dwellings.  The job of a dog warden is to pursue stray animals but if any animal enters a front or back garden the warden cannot go any further and must continue on down the road.  But where an animal enters other premises such as a farm, a factory area or wherever, not a dwelling, a warden should be allowed to capture the animal without the need for a warrant. An animal is a stray animal whether or not it makes it to the haven of someone else's property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I might quote section 11 (1) and (2) of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, the Principal Act, which read:</P>
      <P>(1)  A dog warden shall take all reasonable steps to seize and detain any dog that appears to him to be a stray dog and he may enter any premises (other than a dwelling) for the purposes of such seizure and detention.</P>
      <P>(2)  A member of the Garda Síochána may seize and detain any dog that appears to him to be a stray dog and he may enter any premises (other than a dwelling) for the purposes of such seizure and detention.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as I see it, this amendment is unnecessary.  The insertion of the proposed words is not necessary and would not add anything to the existing powers. I am at a loss to know why such representations are being made to Deputy McCartan in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises from the experiences of the dog warden service in <Col N="1568" /> the city in which I, being a councillor, take a very active interest.  The problem with regard to the dog warden service in Dublin is that those wardens are the employees of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, if you like, on contract from Dublin Corporation. They have attempted through the association to get clarification for some of the legal nuances that can arise with regard to the legislation, with regard to, for example, the authority of the warden to question persons under the age of 16 when he meets such a person on the road with a dog or are seeking to maintain effectual control over a dog.  They have sought, time and again, to get legal advice on that.  It is all very well to say in law that they may enter property but that law must be put against the provisions in our Constitution with regard to the rights of property.  The general principle is that one does not have a right to enter the property of another irrespective of legislation so permitting.  We have to deal with the constitutional rights that exist with regard to property.  The way that is traditionally done is that the person in authority, be it a member of the Garda Síochána or a warden, has recourse to the courts to obtain a warrant or obtains the authority of a judge, on showing good cause, to set aside temporarily, the property rights of the individual concerned, giving the right of entry.  This principle attends all rights of entry of the Garda Síochána and so on.  That is why in the 1986 legislation there are sections dealing with the issue of warrants for the purposes of searching for and seizing animals. If a person in authority could enter a premises whenever he liked we would not have the provisions in the 1986 Act with regard to search warrants.  Our law does not allow us to just give the right of entry.  My amendment seeks to clarify the position.  The dog warden service have been advised to move with caution with regard to this power because they could leave themselves open to actions for trespass. It will not benefit a warden if prosecuted, to cite the authority laid down in section 11 of this Bill because a judge may rule that one can only enter the <Col N="1569" /> property of another on the authority of a warrant, unless we expressly say so in the legislation.  In all legislation dealing with such powers for the Garda or others, the legislation specifies that the powers can only be exercised on foot of a warrant or expressly without a warrant.  My wording would help to clarify the confusion that currently exists.</P>
      <P>If the Minister says that my amendment would have little or no effect, why is there a problem in including it if, as I believe, it would help to clarify a problem?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I have no evidence to suggest that we have run into any difficulty with regard to the exercise of the provision in section 11.  In the normal course of events, it is not that one is disinclined to add something that is unnecessary, it is just that there is no evidence to suggest that this is a problem.  The provisions are very solid.  With regard to adding something which does not make a difference, I would put the question to the Deputy the other way around.

With regard to including the issue in section 4 <Col N="1571" /> of the Control of Dogs Bill, he is not likely to be very successful.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am making a simple but relevant point. Section 4 says that a person is claiming ownership of a stray dog will have to produce a licence for inspection by the local authority or a superintendent of the Garda Síochána in respect of that dog or a general licence in respect of that dog as being part of a group of dogs.  Is it not extraordinary that the House is going into such detail with regard to the family pet who has strayed from home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was quite baffled as to where we were before that interjection. The Minister suggested that the wording was superfluous, that it is not necessary to include it, but I believe the amendment is necessary.  I invite the Minister to look at the matter again before Report Stage, when I will re-enter it.  I hope the Minister will have the opportunity in the interim to consult with the dog wardens about the difficulties they have in this regard. I have in my possession an opinion of counsel on the 1986 Act.  I will quote from it briefly lest the Minister thinks that this is some fanciful notion of my own.  Counsel's opinion on the powers laid down in section 16 are as follows:</P>
      <P>The powers referred to in the preceding paragraph &mdash; these are the powers emphatically laid down under section 16 of the 1986 Act &mdash; may be regarded as exhaustive.  A dog warden should not regard himself as having in addition to these powers any greater power of arrest, search, seizure or indeed investigation than any other citizen.  Should he presume to do so he leaves himself and his employer open to civil court action, Judicial Review and possibly even criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>That is the view of learned counsel who has looked at this matter and rightly or wrongly it leaves the service in some quandary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> I simply want to clarify although dog wardens have the permissive power to enter we need the explicit suggestion that that power can be exercised without recourse to judicial authority, in other words without a warrant.</P>

      <P>We owe a good deal to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and also to the animal welfare groups who augment the work of the dog wardens.  Indeed individual members of the Garda Síochána should be singled out for their good work in this area.  Not all members of the force have the same conscientious attitude to cruelty to animals. We have a very good scheme in Limerick, which I commend to the Minister. Every year the local branch of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals honour individual gardaí for their work in this regard.  Perhaps this practice could be universally applied throughout the country where individual gardaí have distinguished service in bringing cases of cruelty to animals to court.  The honours are awarded in Limerick every year at a social function which is sometimes held in the City Hall.  Indeed I made the presentation this year.  This is a way of recognising the individual contribution of members of the Garda Síochána who augment the work of the dog wardens. As we have not sufficient money to employ dog wardens we should try to enlist the help of the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>In response to Deputy Kemmy let me say that I will give some further thought to the extent to which I can support and be involved in extending this scheme nationwide which encourages and honours the special efforts of individual members of the force in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that Deputy McCartan's amendment cannot be accepted.  The requirement in section 15 that the local authority must employ one or more dog wardens is a sufficient statutory burden to impose.  Not all local authorities would employ two dog wardens at present.  It must be remembered that the control of dogs is a burden on the local authorities as they operate the dog warden service <Col N="1576" /> at a loss and must make up the shortfall between the cost of the service and the income received from dog licence fees from their own resources.  I also ask the Deputy to have regard to the fact that some of our local authorities are very small.  The general purpose of the provision could be met in a great number of local authorities &mdash; and I look forward to the day when they would have the resources to do even better than that.  I think the Deputy will appreciate that to enshrine this in law and make it obligatory right across the board is looking for a bit too much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's suggestion that we are looking for a bit too much exposes a little more that while the Minister is happy to promote legislation he is equally happy to let the legislation lie virtually unimplemented because of the lack of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be incumbent on the Minister to look at the way the legislation is in fact implemented.  Without getting into too great a debate on the development of local authority administration generally, it must be said that this Government and indeed successive Governments have never been too slow to take powers and functions away from the local authorities. The general thrust of this legislation is to be welcomed in that it is giving back powers and responsibilities to the local authorities.  However I wish that the Government would be consistent and recognise the important role the local authorities play in the administration of our civil society and the importance of enhancing and developing the structures, powers and responsibilities of the local authorities.  It is equally frustrating to be given powers and responsibilities while being starved of funds.  I had understood that this message had been brought home clearly to Fianna Fáil in recent years by the informal association of Fianna Fáil councillors throughout the country who rebelled against the centralisation of authority in the various Departments and the fact that local authorities were being starved of funds. <Col N="1577" /> I understood the message had got home very clearly that there was no point in electing councillors to local authorities who could not even fill a pothole in their constituency or provide houses for people who badly need them.  The Minister is enhancing the authority and responsibilities of local authorities but he is not prepared to make any commitment enabling local authorities to meet their responsibilities.  The Minister must give some indication that moneys will be found to fund this service.  We put down this amendment to see what the Minister's reaction would be.  Would he say that, given the scale of the job on hand, this is a reasonable basic minimum?</P>
    <P>The 1986 Act defines what a local authority is.  The Minister spoke about small local authorities.  I am not sure that there are such bodies encompassed in the definition of local authorities.  In Dublin city we have only three dog wardens. Earlier, I read out a letter from the corporation to the ISPCA which indicated that if the administrative officer had his way we would have only one dog warden dealing with stray or vicious animals on the streets; the other two would be checking up on licences and following up the ten-day notices issued to owners of unlicensed dogs.  In the biggest local authority areas we are in practice below the basic minimum provided for in this amendment.  There is a need to establish basic standards if this legislation is to have any meaning.  That is why I advanced the proposition that each local authority be obliged to employ at least two full-time wardens.  I cannot think of one local authority area in which there would be a warden with nothing to do. There are over 600,000 dogs which need the immediate attention of a warden.  A local authority, big or small, could provide work for the service.  It would be a very good source of employment because it would generate revenue.  What is the reservation?  We should lay down minimum standards and get this legislation moving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with Deputy McCartan's amendment.  In 1986 <Col N="1578" /> the then Minister might have been able to argue that it was a good idea to provide that every local authority should have at least one dog warden.  The onus now being placed on dog wardens and local authorities calls for much greater resources for the service.  We in this House are very good at passing legislation which we promptly despatch to local authorities to implement.  We then wash our hands of it and ignore the fact that it is not being implemented.  I refer to such legislation as the Dog Control Act and the Litter Act.  We say it is the responsibility of the local authorities, not of central Government.</P>
      <P>The only good thing about this legislation is that in this instance revenue from dog licences and fines will go to the local authorities.  Very often central Government gobble up any moneys which come in, for example, the fines imposed under the Litter Act.  I would invite the Minister to spend a day with a dog warden in Dublin city or county.  He should travel in the warden's van and accompany him in tackling a pit bull terrier, using the minimal equipment supplied.  Last year the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Flynn, introduced regulations about muzzling, the length of leads and the age of the person with the dog.  These were three extra tasks imposed on a warden who was already operating under the 1986 Act.  He must first identify whether a dog is of a breed which must be muzzled, then look at the length of the lead and get some identification from the person leading the dog if he believes that person is under the age of 16.  The job specification of dog wardens is constantly being expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe there is a real incentive for the Minister to assist in this service.  I am afraid we will have the kind of panic which occurred in 1991 if there is another serious incident where a child is mauled by a vicious dog.  If this happens the Minister will be able to say that the control of dogs is a task for the local authorities and is not his responsibility.  He will not get off the hook that easily.  The Principal Act at least ensures that every local authority has one dog warden.  I would ask the <Col N="1579" /> Minister to carry out a survey and listen to the local authority officials who are trying to provide this service.  He should take a trip in a dog warden's van; it might open his eyes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally with the amendment put forward by Deputies Gilmore and McCartan.  It is a nonsense for the Minister to say that we cannot afford to take on dog wardens.  I am not blaming him in particular.  It is partly due to the way our economic system works. We have over 270,000 people unemployed who are ready and willing to work.  The dog warden service is undermanned but there is no way we can bring these together.  It illustrates once again the need for a basic income scheme which would free up the labour market and enable local authorities to take on these people for this very worthwhile work.</P>

      <P>In the case of Dublin city we do not have adequate resources.  This legislation will impose more duties on the dog wardens and it must be acknowledged that they are not able to cope with the present position.  I am not convinced that the amendment answers this problem.  It requires a minimum of two wardens.  That would address the problem in many local authority areas.  In the case of Dublin we have to look to ways and means for the reallocation of resources or for additional resources to provide for that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unusual to place a statutory burden on a local authority to employ a specified number of persons.  In the 1986 Act the base is not stated as being the optimum.  A cost was attached to it and if we are to increase that burden by a further statutory obligation on the local authorities, without knowing their resources, it would be absolutely reckless on the part of a Minister for the Environment. It would run in the face of everything asked for in terms of local authorities making up their minds on their needs, based on their financial ability. On a broader scale, we must ask if <Col N="1580" /> we have resources for everything?  Do we not have a very highly taxed community? Does each one of us not have a burden of debt of £23,000?  We cannot borrow any more to meet it and we cannot raise more taxes to meet it.  Nobody has suggested the taxes we must raise in order to do that or the amount of money we must borrow.  It is not that local authorities are curtailed but rather what we can afford and what the community can give.  Essentially I am being asked to take away a power from local authorities to make a decision about what they should do in these circumstances.  With regard to resources, we should increase the amount of money available to local authorities from the licence fees and bring into the net the great number of dog owners who at present do not pay the licence fee.</P>
      <P>To ask any Minister for the Environment to impose an additional obligation, without due regard to the financial position of the local authority and without any discussion would be unbelievable.  I have been asked to do this by local elected members who are seeking powers in their own area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy McCartan's question I should say side rules are dangerous.  If we look at Dublin city and county we are talking about seven dog wardens for a population of about one million people.  Nobody is trying to pretend that number is adequate.  In County Leitrim where there are 25,000 people there is an obligation to have one dog warden.  Would it be good practice to oblige Leitrim to have two dog wardens bearing in mind the statistics I have given for Dublin.  When I speak about a small authority, I am referring to a small authority in the context of their financial ability and the geography of the area they serve.  I am not saying one warden is sufficient for any area.  It was a base line from which the service was to grow.  After that it is a question of how much money can we raise and whether this can be ultimately self-financing and enhanced by additional licences being paid by a greater number of people.  They are the <Col N="1581" /> realities as I see them and there is no way around them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Liam Fitzgerald said this amendment does not really address the problem in Dublin although I hope I have illustrated that we are perilously close, in the city at least, to falling below the base line to which the Minister referred.  In response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Gilmore the previous Minister for the Environment in May 1991 established that for six of the local authorities in the country all had one warden.  Curiously, one county only has no full-time dog warden: the county of the Taoiseach, the man who made his living out of providing food for dogs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>One wonders why the county of Longford has one part-time warden.  I would have thought, given the county's geographic spread, that it was utterly irresponsible to consider that one person could do the job of dog control in any county.</P>
      <P>When the Minister mentioned in his first response, the cause of the small authority I looked at the definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in the 1986 Act.  It refers to county councils and borough councils but not to town commissioners or urban district councils.  One cannot genuinely talk in this context about providing one warden even if it is for little Leitrim, or more particularly, lovely Leitrim.  One person cannot be expected to deal adequately with the problems of stray and troublesome dogs in a county.  This is trying to use an element of the stick to force local authorities to move on from a token and a minimalist response to the legislation which has been in place now for six years.  On the other hand it is an effort to address the other side of the coin, the lack of economic and financial response from central Government to making legislation which central Government have put on the Statute Book. There are two ways of looking at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> Section 15 of the original Act did not refer to the need to lay down a minimum regarding staff or specify that at least one warden should be employed.  Subsection (2) of that section required the local authority to maintain a pound or a home for dogs.  The Minister is putting more onus on the shoulders of local authorities than simply saying, &ldquo;employ a person&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be too concerned because if we work within the available resources and make the legislation work for us we will create the revenue to cover the responsibilities.  Due to the half-hearted minimalist reaction to the legislation, perhaps enforced by reasons of staff embargoes or lack of resources the service is not efficient, the revenue is not coming in and is going nowhere.  The amendment is an important one to force on local authorities to highlight the lack of financial commitment from central Government for legislation they are putting on the Statute Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the points raised by previous speakers I am tempted to ask what are we doing here?  What will be the effect of the detail and the reflection which has gone into this legislation? Are we simply going through the parliamentary motions?  Surely, the objective of what we do in this House is to change things, to make things better, to correct anomalies or disadvantages from which people suffer?  That is what I believe legislation is about.  What is the point in this legislation if down the line there will not be sufficient resources or personnel to ensure that what we agree today will be put into effect?  Where is the point in all of this if we cannot have an assurance that what we agree and vote on will not be implemented?  It is rather like the chicken and the egg.  The Minister said that if we had the resources we could pay the wardens.  I agree with those who say one dog warden in a county is not sufficient.  Seven in an area the size of Dublin or in other cities is not sufficient.  We need double that number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 580,000 people do not have a licence.  If all of these paid up, and <Col N="1583" /> paid even £5, we would be talking about a substantial amount of money which would allow us to employ extra wardens. I also suggest, in an effort to achieve this desirable goal, that it might be worthwhile organising an advertising campaign. The television licence advertising campaign was very effective in putting the &ldquo;frighteners&rdquo; on people and it led to a substantial amount of money being raised.  We should tell people that they have to have a licence and that someone is going to call at their door.  It is much more difficult to hide a dog than a television set.</P>
    <P>We should make an all-out effort to get the money in and make a commitment to provide the necessary number of wardens, because if we do not, not only will the public become more cynical but so will we, in the context of our effectiveness. The Minister should take control and ensure that instructions are given down the line so that this problem is tackled realistically.  I do not want to upset the Minister.  It is all very well for him to throw his hands in the air and say that we cannot tell people what to do but I believe that is what we have to do.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long, including my colleague, Deputy Kemmy, on the Front Bench, but I felt, listening to the debate in my office, that I had to come into the House to say what I had to say.  This legislation will be a nonsense if the amendment we are now discussing is not taken on board by the Minister.  It would be like a long list of other legislation which imposes financial burdens on local authorities who have no money to carry out their statutory duties. This is not dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the dog warden system, in my own county of Kildare we have one dog warden who is financed partly by the IFA, dog licence fees and other subscriptions. Despite his best efforts, he is totally ineffective.  There are dogs roaming wild through housing estates in County Kildare who would eat a person <Col N="1584" /> alive in some instances if one did not have a good lump of stick with which to protect oneself.  The warden is not effective because money is not there to provide him with the necessary resources, staff and other facilities.  The Minister is now introducing further legislation which will place an extra burden on local authorities but all he is doing is wasting the time of this House.  As the last speaker has said, the public will only become more cynical in regard to our efforts to do something which will affect their lives.</P>
    <P>We are repeating our mistakes in introducing legislation that cannot be implemented because resources are not being provided.  The best recent example of this is the Bill to control private abattoirs which places a responsibility on the local authorities to provide veterinary inspectors.  Because the Government have failed to make an order to set the charges &mdash; I am drawing an analogy between the two Bills &mdash; in all cases where veterinary inspectors have been appointed, the local authorities have incurred costs of about £50,000 a year. This case is worse because the Minister is not providing the necessary resources to implement what I consider to be good law, but good law is an ass if it cannot be implemented.  The Minister must provide the local authorities with the necessary resources so that they can implement the good law he is proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up the point made by Deputy Fennell who asked what are we doing here because it seems that we are involved in an exercise of public deception.  A problem has arisen and the response of the Government and the Legislature is to pass grandiose legislation which cannot be implemented.  If memory serves me correctly, the 1986 Act was introduced in response to an attack on a child by a dog either in Tallaght or Clondalkin.  There was a public outcry at the time and the Government's response, as I said, was to introduce new legislation to control dogs and the 1986 Act was born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation has been introduced in response to the public concern expressed <Col N="1585" /> in this country following the attack on a child by a pitbull terrier in Britain.  The newspapers showed in graphic detail the damage done to the child as a result of that attack.  The response of the Minister for the Environment at that time was to introduce new regulations to muzzle a long list of dogs and legislation to go with it.  Therefore when there is a public outcry about the need to control dogs the Government's answer is to introduce new legislation.  The fact of the matter however is that the existing legislation is not being implemented for the simple reason that there are not enough dog wardens to implement it.  Section 6 of this Bill enables the Minister for the Environment to make regulations dealing with about 20 different matters all of which would have to be policed and controlled by dog wardens who do not exist on the ground.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Fitzgerald's point that this amendment does not address the problem in Dublin.  Incidentally we are not talking here about small local authorities but about county councils and their equivalents most of which have just one dog warden, the bare minimum provided for in the 1986 Act, in order to fulfil their obligations under that Act.  An amendment which proposed that resources be provided to enable the local authorities to hire dog wardens would be ruled out of order by the Chair.  The least we can do to signal &mdash; and it does no more than that &mdash; that it is the wish of this House that more dog wardens be employed is to suggest that the minimum number, as required by the 1986 Act, be increased by one.  I fully accept that this does not address the problem in Dublin. Even when there are four separate local authorities in Dublin, more than eight dog wardens will still be required to address the problem.  However I feel that it is necessary for us to indicate that there is a need to employ more dog wardens.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct when he says that, ultimately, it is a question of resources.  Those of us who are members of local authorities know only too well that the local authorities are blue in the face in regard to legislation that is handed <Col N="1586" /> down from the Oireachtas and regulations handed down from the Department of the Environment which require them to do this, that and the other, for which they do not have the resources to implement or employ the necessary staff. Ultimately, it comes down to a question of resources and the Minister for the Environment is going to have to address it.</P>
    <P>We must be honest with the people. There is no point in telling them that new legislation is being passed in this House to control dogs when the resources are not being provided to give effect to it.  It would be far better and far more honest if the Minister for the Environment stood up in this House and told the people that we do not have the resources to police the 600,000 unlicensed dogs, to provide dog wardens to enforce the existing legislation, much less the new legislation, and that they will have to live with the problem of uncontrolled dogs.  That would be an honest response, but it is a dishonest response to the problem to pass legislation introducing regulations which we all know cannot be implemented.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation and regulations are not being implemented because of lack of resources and staff and new and additional regulations and legislation cannot be implemented for that reason.  We are only asking for one extra dog warden in each local authority and if the Minister is saying that the resources are not there to do the minimum amount then he should tell the public that dogs cannot be controlled because the resources are not available and that he, effectively, has thrown his hat at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely aware of that.  The issue relates directly to the capacity of the legislation to work.  The Minister seems to think that matters are working well but, before he replies to the <Col N="1587" /> points made by Deputies on this side of the House in regard to this amendment, I should like to quote from a circular sent from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to their dog wardens round the country.  All except three of the local authorities listed employ or have staff sub-contracted to the ISPCA for the purposes of the provision of the dog warden service.  The heading on the circular recently issued is &ldquo;Donations&rdquo;. It states:</P>
      <P>Members of the executive committee have expressed concern at the surprising discrepancy or variation in amounts of donations returned to HQ by some wardens.  It would appear that, in some of the poorer parts of the country, some wardens do not appear to be receiving any donations from the public.  All wardens are urged to endeavour to secure donations.  The receipt of donations from the public is often a barometer of how the service is valued by the local community.  Also HQ administration is under increasing pressure to operate within a very tight budget.  Wardens are asked to renew efforts to secure donations, no matter how small, and return them to the ISPCA HQ.</P>
      <P>Wardens are not only expected to chase stray dogs and vicious animals but, apparently, to make the service operate from the point of view of the major contractor &mdash; the ISPCA &mdash; they are supposed to collect money as well.  It is the most graphic illustration I can give to this House regarding the service; it is in tatters.  The reason is that we have legislated to provide a service without giving it the financial resources to do the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me develop my point. If we do not have resources should we not introduce legislation even though it would be our hope and aspiration to reach that goal?  Will we not bother to introduce legislation because we do not have an ideal situation?  I am not suggesting that we go down that road.  The reason for this legislation is that there are irresponsible dog owners.  When someone owns a dog it imposes certain obligations in regard to training, management and control of the animal.</P>
      <P>I will now respond to the other argument in the context of legislation.  Will we legislate for everything?  Will we pay for everything?  Have society or individuals no responsibility to do anything for themselves?  Must we follow everyone with a dog to their home or premises with the taxpayer supplying the money?  Can we be educated to understand that we can make savings by doing things ourselves and being encouraged to do them? On the one hand Deputies argue that we must legislate and provide finance for everything &mdash; God knows where it will come from &mdash; and on the other hand they talk about me not obliging local authorities to have at least two dog wardens. I argued that it is a matter for local authorities, consistent with their resources, to do so and that I could not force them to do so.  We set down the base requirements in the 1986 Act and if we now make it obligatory on local authorities to have two wardens there will be a cost in salaries of £400,000.  If I did that each Member would be entitled to ask who would provide the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have talked all day about this service being self-financing.  That is not the <Col N="1589" /> case at present but it is the way we want it to operate in future.  If everybody who owned a dog paid for a licence it could be self-financing and the number of dog wardens could be increased substantially. I said earlier that I would have discussions with local authorities with a view to funding ways and means to ensure that we can substantially increase the income from dog licences to enable us to have part-time and full-time dog wardens on a much wider scale across the whole country.</P>
    <P>We cannot make local authorities do something under legislation and I wish to tell Deputy Stagg that we are not shrinking from the problem.  We want it to work but we must face reality.  Some local authorities are quite small and I cannot oblige them to make expenditure where the resources are not available to them to do that.  However, it is consistent with everything we have said all day, that the answer to the problem is that dog owners should pay the licence and that the licence be used exclusively for the warden service.  If that happened, we would be in a position to provide as good a service as the country could afford. Having said that, I do not want to argue about legislation not being enacted because we do not have resources.  If you go down that road the State will be obliged to handle evey problem which comes up, as far as society is concerned. It is time to address the question of our responsibility.  Ownershp of dogs carries obligations and the State and the taxpayer cannot be expected to meet the natural obligations which people have in every instance; we will go as far as we can in encouraging local authorities to enhance and increase those numbers consistent with the money becoming available to do it.  They will have the right to decide how to spend it on the services and I do not think we can go any further than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am impressed with the eloquence with which the Minister makes his case, I am not impressed by his arguments.  I am very disappointed that the Minister will not accept this <Col N="1590" /> amendment.  In 1986, when the basic founding legislation was introduced, by definition a financial obligation was imposed on local authorities.  The argument that you cannot do this, that you cannot force local authorities to do something because of their stretched financial resources does not really stand up.  The Minister asked if we had to legislate for everything; of course we do not, nor do we suggest that you must pursue everyone down the road with a dog warden. There is not even one full-time dog warden in the Taoiseach's county.  How can that local authority give effect to this legislation?  Only 20 of the 32 or more local authorities we are dealing with in the context of this legislation have the services of a full-time dog warden available to them.</P>
      <P>I am merely suggesting that there is a problem on a massive scale in this area. The Minister has been motivated to bring in legislation to deal with this problem and we are simply saying that more resources need to be directed towards it. We are suggesting, as a minimum, that each local authority should be required to employ two dog wardens.  This will not break a local authority in terms of finance.  Rather it will give a signal that this House wants to see some action as a result of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I have spoken with dog wardens in Dublin and they recognise that they may be working themselves out of a job if the problem is brought under control and people act responsibly.  Nevertheless, a commitment is needed to ensure that the legislation is effective.  Our amendment shows that we are serious about the legislation. The introduction of the minimum requirement of two dog wardens per county proposed in our amendment does not mean we will be running away with ourselves or allowing for the scenario which the Minister painted here earlier of dog wardens chasing people up and down the highways and byways of the country.  That is not what is being suggested. The requirement of two dog wardens per county will not overstretch the resources of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing that two dog wardens per county is sufficient.  I hope nothing I have said would give the Deputy the impression that I regard the present numbers in the service as adequate.  I would be extremely disappointed if a substantially greater number of people were not employed in the service in a year or two from now.  I would also go so far as to say that if I were to accede to the Deputy's amendment it may well be that certain local authorities who could and should employ a greater number of dog wardens would, in the light of experience and improved revenue from the dog licences, regard their obligations as fulfilled if they met a new statutory requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the position in 1986.  I do not recall the circumstances which prevailed at that time.  I expect the Minister of the day was worried about whether local authorities would introduce <Col N="1592" /> this scheme at all.  Therefore, the laying down of a base line was an essential tool to enable this to happen.  I would not be in favour of setting targets, limits or obligations for local authorities.  I am saying that I would be extremely disappointed if the net call-down from the licences was not improved substantially, which would lead to an increase in the number of dog wardens.  As I said, no limit should be set for local authorities because different circumstances obtain in different areas.  It is my ambition to ensure, through negotiations and discussions with local authorities, that the service will be enhanced over the next couple of years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) (i)  Destruction shall not apply to a dog which has been tattooed, implanted, or otherwise identified under a national dog identification and registration scheme, unless ordered by a District Court.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Where a tattoo or other means of identification is not visible on a dog, the dog shall be scanned for the presence of a microchip implant.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the vote the Minister chose to address a homily to this side of the House <Col N="1595" /> and he perhaps rebuked us for some of the amendments that had been put down. I assure the Minister most sincerely that the amendments were well grounded and well intentioned.</P>
    <P>I take his point that the Government must not interfere in every aspect of life and that the best the Government can do is lay down an infrastructure that will allow people to lead civilised, decent lives.  That is grand as an overall formula, but when the House comes to the nitty-gritty of a Bill such as this &mdash; and the House has not had a discussion on dog control for the past six years &mdash; it is hard to frame legislation that will gain universal approval when it concerns issues about which Members themselves have questions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based on several unproved assumptions.  One of its big flaws is that it does not attempt to deal with dog fighting, possibly one of the root causes for the existence of dangerous dogs in our society.  Those responsible are in the main the delinquent owners of dogs and that is an aspect that I should like to deal with.  The Bill provides the Minister with wide powers and he is able to make impositions such as destruction, sterilisation and other stringent measures.  The first section of my amendment seeks to limit the Minister's powers in that regard.  The second part of the amendment seeks to extend those powers, I suppose.  There may, perhaps, be some controversy on that point.</P>
    <P>In an earlier contribution I mentioned an interesting article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> two days ago.  Dermot Kelly analysed the Minister's Bill and made a few pointers about what it was that the dog lobbyists were trying to achieve.  I quote from that article:</P>
    <P>If an effective identification does come about, all dogs would be traceable, or be liable to be put down.  Their owners would also be responsible for any damage they do.</P>
    <P>Dermot Kelly went on to say that dog owners would press the Minister to pin responsibility for dogs on their owners <Col N="1596" /> and would support the idea of a national identification scheme.  I support such a scheme, too.  I am sure that all Members would.  To have a national identification scheme from which the Minister could work is the only logical, professional way forward.  Dealing with that point, Dermot Kelly stated:</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the introduction of a national identification scheme.  This latter proposal enjoys the support of the dog lobby, including the Irish Kennel Club, but the system of identification remains controversial. Some favour implanting all dogs for which licences are issued.  Others prefer tattooing.</P>
    <P>The trouble with implants is that dogs could only be identified after scanning and scanners would be expensive to instal on a large scale.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am making some of the points here against myself, but that is not wrong. We have not come to the House to try to trick the Minister making legislation that is not good.  On the contrary, we have wished that the Minister would take on board some of our points.  There is no benefit in every amendment tabled by the Opposition being voted down by the Government.</P>
    <P>This issue is not black and white, I am certain of that from my own study of the Bill.  This is a very difficult issue to be certain about.  It is also very hard to frame some of the points made by the Minister and some of the points made by Opposition Members in precise language.  A minefield of difficulties is encountered in an attempt to frame legislation that will cover all aspects and allow people to enjoy the company of dogs while also banning dog fighting &mdash; a provision omitted in the Bill &mdash; and dangerous dogs and making provision to not muzzle dogs according to breed.  This Bill is an imprecise instrument by which to achieve what it was designed for.  Even though the Bill is a good attempt to provide legislation that updates and improves the 1986 legislation, there will be difficulties in ensuring its universal application and <Col N="1597" /> it will cause more difficulties further down the line.</P>
    <P>Before the Bill is voted on and concluded tonight, I ask the Minister and his officials to consider some of the points made by Opposition Deputies and, if possible, to take them on board at a later stage, if not in the House then in practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. which was clearly described by Deputy Kemmy in his summary of the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Bill.  I should like to hear the Minister tell us what is his attitude to a national identification scheme. Those who really love dogs and who belong to dogs' organisations have already stated support for that procedure. Although implants and scanners might be expensive, they would provide a modern method of dealing with the issue, one that was efficient and left no room for doubt.</P>
      <P>My party would like to re-enter the amendments on Report Stage because we are not satisfied with the outcome of the debate.  The Minister had no amendment tabled today but if he moves any amendments before Report Stage we will consider them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a quick answer to the point just raised.  The Deputy mentioned tattooing or other means of electronic identification of dogs.  Naturally, I am completely in favour of such a scheme, and provision is made for it.  That is the only sure method of identifying owners, particularly in areas where there are problems in the control of dangerous dogs and so on.</P>

    <P>However, the effect of clause (b) (i) of both amendments Nos. 11 and 12 would be that the power to destroy a dog detained in connection with an offence, unless somebody undertook to pay for its keep, would not be exercisable in relation to a dog that had been tattooed, implanted or otherwise identified under a national dog identification scheme if such a scheme were in operation.  Clearly, that is not acceptable.  The fact that a dog could be identified would make it easier to contact its owner and secure an undertaking to <Col N="1598" /> pay.  The objective of this section of the Bill is to ensure that local authorities will not be out of pocket for keeping a dog and will not have to resort to the courts to recover money except in exceptional circumstances.  The amendment would negative that provision and cannot be accepted.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister does not accept my point. People who belong to the Irish Kennel Club and other similar organisations feel that their position would be considerably exposed without the provision of some kind of appeal system.  That is the reason for reference to the District Court in the amendment.</P>
      <P>Much controversy has arisen as a result of serious stories about extremelly bad and vicious animals that have been published in the British news media and in some of the Irish papers.  By and large, when talking about the Bill today, the Minister has agreed that the vast majority of dog owners are dog lovers.  They would like to be provided with some kind of defence.  Perhaps the Minister could devise some means of protection, through the District Court, or some group within a local authority, who could adjudicate on this without incurring a cost factor.</P>

      <P>To contend that all dogs of a certain breed are dangerous and must be controlled lest they attack someone is not a logical response.  It is not logical to condemn all dogs of a certain breed in a blanket fashion.  Indeed that is the fundamentally flawed thinking behind this Bill.  The only criteria that can be adopted in this matter are those based on the behavioural aspects of dogs rather than adopting a black and white attitude throughout these provisions.</P>

    <P>I hope that in the months ahead the Minister will continue his talks with the various bodies that have made submissions to him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to this debate and to discuss our railway network.  As an island country communications and transport are of vital importance to us. As an island on the periphery of the European continent it is important that we have an efficient railway and overall transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we tended to have a rather negative attitude to our railways and did not perceive them as constituting a valuable asset or resource.  Neither did we understand the difficulties of Irish Rail, or the difficulties of CIE, as the company was known in the past, encountered in providing a railway network in a country like ours under-populated by 3.5 million people.  Perhaps we did not perceive the competitive difficulties facing the country <Col N="1601" /> as clearly as we might, or that the company suffered from under-funding while endeavouring to provide our people with a social service.  We are lucky that so many of our rail lines have survived.</P>
    <P>When speaking last evening Deputy Moynihan referred to a number of lines that had not survived in County Kerry and other parts of the country.  I realise that railway lines cannot be preserved as a mere, quaint legacy of the past affording people opportunities to come along and make films there; that is not what I had in mind at all.  We must perceive our railways as a valuable asset, providing a means of communication and transport for our people and goods.  In that context it was a great pity that the West Clare railway was dismantled in 1961, a great loss, as was the Rathkeale to Listowel railway line, a great loss to the counties of Kerry and Limerick and indeed nationally.</P>
    <P>A climate of fear has been engendered in our society, especially among Irish rail workers, it being recognised for some time past that the Government have not allocated sufficient money for investment in rolling stock for the maintenance of our permanent lines.</P>
    <P>Therefore I was pleased to hear the Minister say there would be no closures of any additional lines.  I welcome that announcement.  I forgot to congratulate her on her appointment.  She made a comprehensive introductory speech saying there would be no further closures but rather that funding would be continued and, if possible, augmented.  I also welcome the Minister's commitment to upgrading our rolling stock, also important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates in the course of his introductory remarks cast some doubt on the safety aspects in Irish Rail.  I doubt the validity of that contention because, when one compares the record of Irish Rail, formerly CIE, with other transport companies and modes of transport, one discovers their performance compares favourably.  I always travel from Limerick to Dublin by train and indeed to other parts of the country.  I contend that it is one of the best modes of transport <Col N="1602" /> affording one an opportunity to work, read and take refreshments on board.  I suppose we should be grateful that not more lines were terminated in the less enlightened days of the past.</P>
    <P>We must emphasise the positive as well as the negative aspects of our railway system.  In more recent times there have been good industrial relations in the company, this being a positive contribution on the part of their workforce ensuring efficiency and good relations overall. Public transport is a valuable asset our society often take for granted, its benefits not being sufficiently recognised.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately Irish Rail have suffered a considerable amount of valdalism to their property and other fittings on railway lines and stations in recent times.  All of us public representatives will be aware of this trend, having had representations from many residents about vandalism perpetrated on the property and homes adjoining railway lines.  Recently in Limerick I received representations from two groups in the community, in the north city area, who have suffered a great deal of vandalism on the part of people walking the lines.  When we were young, railway lines were sacrosanct; one would never walk on them, fully realising the dangers involved, that it was private property and not something to be used as a playground.  I walked the line recently in Limerick with an engineer of Irish Rail from Limerick Junction headquarters when the line was like a public thoroughfare with men, women, boys and girls walking along the line as though it were a roadway.  I inquired of that engineer whether they could be stopped. He replied it was a matter for the Garda, that while they were technically trespassing the law was being flouted and ignored.  It is a sad state of affairs that people can walk on our railway lines with impunity, taking their lives into their hands.  There is also the spectacle of young people unemployed, or early dropouts from schools, who trespass on our railway lines in order to drink cider and wine and vandalise property.  It would appear that people, especially in urban areas and cities are suffering from such <Col N="1603" /> vandalism.  I should be very interested to know the annual amount and cost of the vandalism perpetrated agains Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>Neither have we recognised the contribution our railways make to our tourism industry, many tourists like to travel by train, it being safer than road transport.  When one remembers the crime committed on trains in other countries it can be said that, by and large, our trains are free of such crime, something which should be emphasised on the positive side.</P>
    <P>I might also compliment Irish Rail on keeping the Dublin/Belfast railway line open despite the threats of bombs being placed on the line on an almost weekly basis.  I travel to Belfast occasionally.  On my last two trips there there were threats of bombs on the line, when I saw people change from the train to buses, old and young alike, some with babies in arms.  I thought then: how horrible to subject people, North and South, to this type of terrorism.  It is a traumatic experience. There is also the inconvenience of transferring from train to bus, sometimes in bad weather.  What kind of people can do that to their fellow citizens?  I am delighted that both railway companies have kept the line open.  It would be a bad day for this island if we allowed terrorism to stop our trains running.  We must never allow a small minority to control the majority.  It is important to keep the line open between Dublin and Belfast.</P>
    <P>Before Deputy Brennan moved on to greener pastures I read a report in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on Wednesday 5 February under the headings &ldquo;Harcourt Street back on line&rdquo;&ldquo;Cabinet approves bus and tram plan for old railway&rdquo;.  I am not sure how accurate this report was, but I would like to know if the Cabinet have met on this question of reopening the Harcourt Street line.  The Minister might let me know when she is replying, because there has been a lot of speculation in that regard.</P>

      <P>I support the Government amendment.  There is no sense in putting down a Private Members' motion every so often for the sake of debating a motion during &ldquo;Private Members&rdquo; time. We need strong ideas about where we are going.  I have no doubt that we provide an excellent rail service.  Successive governments have not spent sufficient money on the service, although over the past few years something like £950 million has been spent on it.  The railway system is an environmentally friendly way to move a lot of people.  It is also an excellent way to transport heavy bulk over long distances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of our problems relates to the size of the country.  Transport experts say that it is uneconomical to transport huge amounts of freight by rail unless it is going over 100 miles and some people say up to 200 miles.  Most of the business generated in Dublin Port is within ten or 15 miles of the port.  People, including me, thought that it would be a good idea to put containers on to a train and move them out to the areas outside of the city. However, that is uneconomical for moving freight only 15 miles, as every move costs at least £12 and to transport small numbers of containers would cost £20 per move, that is two moves at a cost of £40.  I looked at a report dealing with moving freight to Cork city.  By rail it would cost about £200 and by road about £260.  One could leave Dublin by road at 7 a.m. and deliver the freight right to its destination in Cork by 12 noon.  To move <Col N="1605" /> something by rail would take two days, taking into account the loading and unloading time at each end.  The problem of freight on the railways is a major problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to transporting passengers one just has to look at the success of the DART.  Even if it has to be subsidised for many years, it is the best way to transport people.  We can carry thousands of people every day without interfering with the environment.  One of the major transport lanes is from Dublin to Belfast.  At nearly every meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary body of which I am a member the rail link between Dublin and Belfast is raised.  We should spend some money on that route to encourage people to use it as traffic through old towns like Drogheda and Dundalk is choking the roads.  We need a non-stop train between Dublin, Drogheda, Dundalk and Belfast and this would promote good relations between the northern parts of the country and Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is no nicer way to travel from Dublin to Galway than by train.  The most beautiful entrance into the city is by train. Somebody referred to safety problems but it is only a case of slowing down trains in some areas and spending a bit of money.  Although the Kennedy, Henderson report has not been circulated yet, everyone seems to have seen it.  The report indicates some areas where safety should be upgraded.  The Government will tackle those issues straight away.  As far as I know, CIE have indicated that they will tackle the problems.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there will be any rail closures.  There is not much left but we still cover the western, southern and south-eastern seaboards.  I regularly travel on the trains, which is one of the best ways to see Ireland.  It is very relaxing and it is quicker than by car.  We should encourage people to travel by rail. There is no point in suggesting that railway lines will be closed.  The Government have said that they will not close down railway lines and there is nothing in any of the reports to suggest that lines will be closed.  I have been assured that the <Col N="1606" /> Government do not intend closing any of the lines that are open.</P>

      <P>We did a fair bit of that ourselves.  We are committed to looking after the railways.  Considering what the Minister said with regard to Dublin and light rail, one realises that it is all part of an ongoing philosophy on how to move people.  On the one hand, there is the light rail and, on the other, there are the old railway lines around Dublin.  I have asked that CIE should look at all the old lines and consider how they can be used. In the case of Croke Park, which it is proposed to modernise, it has been suggested that there be a passenger base there, an excellent way of using the rail line.  There is a great future for rail transport. The Minister, who is from the west, is fully aware of the problems with the railways and she has gone about dealing with them in the right way.</P>
      <P>We are on the periphery of Europe and it is very important that this matter is dealt with soon.  I feel happy that it will.  In the next four to five years the rail service will be transformed beyond recognition.  However, we will have to concentrate on passenger rather than freight traffic.  I would love to see that emphasis reversed but I am not sure if it would be economically viable.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús, ní mór dom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht gur toghadh é mar Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Turasóireachta, Iompair agus Cumarsáide, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh a chuid oibre le feiceáil againn sna míonna agus sna blianta atá romhainn.  I support the Minister's amendment to this Private Members' motion.  Because of the limited time remaining, I will be brief.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer once again as I did previously in the Dáil and Seanad when I was Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications to the total subvention to CIE in respect of the provision of an essential public transport service.  The subvention this year will amount to £108 million, which is just over £2 million per week. More than £86 million of that figure will be spent on the railways.  In addition, the Public Capital Programme provides for expenditure of £36.2 million, of which £10.3 million has been allocated for expenditure on railway signalling, new rolling stock and other rail related infrastructure. The allocation of resources within the group's individual capital programmes is a matter totally for the board of Córas Iompair Éireann, of Iarnród Éireann, of Bus Éireann and of Bus Átha Cliath.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the level of State support to the railways over the past ten years.  A sum of £940 million was spent in that time on the railways and this is a firm indication of the Government's overall commitment to the national rail network.  In the same decade, there was an expenditure of almost £250 million by CIE on major capital works on the rail network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have also approved the purchase of new rail cars at a cost of £18 million and this will further enhance Iarnród Éireann's commuter rail service. The total investment made by Iarnród Éireann since 1987 in signalling, rolling stock and renewal of rail lines amounts to over £71 million, of which £49 million <Col N="1608" /> was spent on track renewal.  The Public Capital Programme for 1992 provides for capital expenditure by CIE of £45 million, of which £17.8 million is being allocated to Iarnród Éireann for investment in new rolling stock.  The allocation of these resources to specific projects is a matter for Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the downgrading of railway lines and some speakers said lines were to be closed.  I should like to say that during my time in the Department, there were no proposals before the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to close or downgrade any of the rail lines.  I do not know where the scaremongering has come from.</P>
    <P>A strategic study of the investment needed and the resources required for the rail network is being undertaken as a matter of urgency and the results of the study will form an integral element in the formulation of a spending programme to be compiled for the next phase of the Structural Funds or under the Cohesion Fund.  The Minister proposes to seek a greater share from the European Community of the significantly increased Structural Funds together with allocations from the new Cohesion Fund for the railways.  I take this opportunity to categorically reject allegations that the Government have a hidden agenda to close down the rail network or any part of it by stealth or through a deliberate lack of financial support.  Nothing could be further from the truth and such allegations are clearly contrary to the facts.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the information given by Deputy Yates.  I found it ironic in view of the rail policy adopted by his party when in Government which was encapsulated in their policy document <i>Building On Reality</i>.  I will not quote from it because everybody knows what it was.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the successes attained by Iarnród Éireann in recent times in the increasing the volume of passenger and freight traffic.  In 1990 the company recorded over 25 million passenger journeys which is the highest figure of passenger journeys since the rail service was first introduced to Ireland.  I hope <Col N="1609" /> Iarnród Éireann will have continued success. Their success has been achieved through the contribution of all the staff, management and employees, and it is gratifying to note that the productivity and output per employee has increased by 10 per cent since 1987.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Government approved investment by CIE of up to £18 million on new rail cars for the suburban line, I wish to take this opportunity to be parochial and place on record my hope that Iarnród Éireann will see to it that the rolling stock on the Cork-Cobh line will be improved by an allocation of some of these new rail cars.  I should point out that the continuing development of the Cobh line is important for the existing traffic on that route and also for the extra traffic that will be generated by the development of the Cobh Heritage Project, which I have been committed to from its inception.</P>
    <P>The new rail cars will be funded entirely by Córas Iompair Éireann from a combination of their own resources and commercial borrowings.  I understand that a contract for these new rail cars will be placed shortly and that the rolling stock will be used immediately on delivery, which is expected in 1994.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the rail service is part of the strategy for public transport in Ireland.  In fact, the experience of rail in European terms has been the subject of much discussion at the Council meetings which I attended.  In recent years a great deal of time was devoted to the rail network in conjunction with combined transport.  At first this only included rail, road and inland waterways but through our efforts we had the maritime included to take account of our peripheral position. Now that the combined transport network of rail, inland waterways and martime has been included in the vocabulary of the Commission I ask the Minister to pursue as diligently, strongly and as emphatically as possible funding for our combined transport structure and to place emphasis on getting aid from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund for moveable assets.  An agreement under the Maastricht Treaty included the <Col N="1610" /> peripheral states such as Ireland and I urge the Minister to continue to emphasise the importance of funding so that we can put in place an efficient and modern public transport network.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kenneally, on his appointment, which has particularly pleased people in the south-east.  I wish him well in his portfolio.  I welcome the Government amendment to this motion.</P>
      <P>There has been much debate in the past year or so in relation to the future of the rail service and this is to be welcomed. The previous Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, announced his intention recently of setting up a commission to review the operation of the rail system and this commission will obviously have to address the whole question of the funding of the railways, particularly EC funding.</P>
      <P>There has to be a future for the railways in Ireland on the basis of peripherality. As Ireland is peripheral to Europe, then the areas of the country served by rail and, indeed, other forms of transport, are peripheral to the peripheral. If regional policy in Europe means anything, if the cohesion protocol of the Maastricht Treaty means what it says, then all of Ireland and not just Dublin must have efficient and cost-effective access to market in the same way as central areas of Europe have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport, therefore, has a major influence on the continuing health of our economy.  Adequate access transport facilities and services are essential both <Col N="1611" /> to the future development of Irish tourism and to industrial development, especially given Ireland's export-oriented economy.</P>
    <P>Major transport investment is needed if we are to achieve our full potential and exploit the new internal market.  Such investment is essential if Ireland is to hold its own, particularly with the advent of the enhanced peripherality which will result from the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1993.  It is essential that Ireland's transport system be integrated as far as possible with the European network and that all modes, road, rail, sea, air, have a role to play.</P>
    <P>The current operational programme on peripherality, which runs from 1989 to 1993, has caused a severe imbalance in favour of road investment within Ireland at the expense of rail, without any proven justification.  This programme provides for a total investment of £818 millions in the period to 1993, attracting EC grant of £516 million.  Within that figure of £818 million, road development secures 75 per cent or £615 million, while railways in the Dublin area receive £28 million or just 4 per cent and very little is available for railways outside of Dublin. We have to be concerned at the degree of imbalance in this investment.  There is no doubt that our transport system needs investment, but full consideration has to be given to the relative merits of all modes of transport within this programme.</P>
    <P>There has been a general recognition that there is an urgent need to address environmental issues and problems and to manage resources wisely.  Transport and its associated infrastructure can have severe environmental effects in terms of air quality, health, amenity, noise and visual intrusion and accidents.  The railways have a very good environmental and safety record and trains are among the lowest risk categories for personal injuries.  It appears to me that in the past the social benefits to be gained by wider use of railways have been ignored when it comes to funding decisions.</P>
    <P>Budget constraints in terms of public <Col N="1612" /> spending have to apply equally to rail and road modes, for example.  It should not be acceptable that financial support for railways should be equated with loss-making and inefficiency in the context of the broader general transport policy, and the question has to be asked whether the social costs incurred by each form of transport be charged against that particular mode of transport.</P>
    <P>One of the major successes of the railway company has been the operation of the port of Rosslare Harbour.  A spectacular growth in business has taken place over the past five or six years, with the result that over 1.25 million people use this part every year.  The terminal is one of the finest in Europe.</P>
    <P>However, often the main Rosslare-Dublin train leaves Rosslare Harbour minutes before the boat arrives.  This has led to a great deal of anger and annoyance among tourists and local people. A more flexible arrangement could be provided on the Rosslare-Dublin route through the provision of self-propelled rail cars.  What the railway needs most of all at present is investment in infrastructure, namely track and signalling.  In so far as the track is concerned, Government investment has, up to now, resulted in almost 400 miles of continuous welded rail but there is an urgent need to invest in a further 600 miles on the radial routes. The benefits from this investment would be reduced journey times and increased passenger comfort, both of which are necessary if the railway is to compete.</P>
    <P>With regard to signalling we have, again as a result of Government investment, computer controlled systems between Dublin and Bray, Dublin and Cork, Dublin and Limerick and Dublin and Athlone.  I welcome the Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the railways and to that extent I compliment and congratulate Deputy Yates on introducing the motion. Obviously I will be supporting the Government amendment.  I also congratulate and welcome my colleague and <Col N="1613" /> good friend, Deputy Kenneally, the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity Deputy Yates was not in a position of some authority at the outset of the 1980s when his party, who had campaigned on the issue of mass transit in the greater Dublin area, came to power.  The first thing they did in the rail area when in power was to chop the decision to extend the rail electrification from Bray to Greystones.  I do not blame simply the Government parties at that time.  There was a singular lack of foresight amongst our planners and developers.  It was not simply a political flaw, although there were plenty of political flaws in that Government.  It was in fact a flaw amongst the planners.  Unfortunately I have to say that my own party when they returned to power shortly afterwards did not do a great deal better and we are left with a position where the mass transit system to the north Wicklow commuter belt is inadequate.  We actually have to borrow rolling stock and rail cars from the North of Ireland to service the commuter needs of our people.  That is surely a scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lyons made the point that in the past decade £940 million of taxpayers' money has been invested in the railways by way of one form of subvention or another.  Over £230 million has been put into capital services.  It is specifically about capital services that I should like to speak.  The sum of £18 million was allocated in recent times, the first capital input to rolling stock in many years.  CIE and now Iarnród Éireann rightly made the point that they were starved in this regard by successive administrations. When the £18 million was allocated, following the prompting of myself and all the Dáil representatives from County Wicklow, the then Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, made specific reference in the allocation to a portion of that money being used to upgrade the rolling stock on the Bray-Greystones commuter line.  I do not apologise for being parochial in this matter.  People who take an interest in the rail system know that unless that kind of investment is made the rail system will not grow.  The <Col N="1614" /> company will then say that not enough people are using the system to justify its development.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the Government made specific reference to upgrading the rolling stock on the Bray-Greystones line.  In recent months I have been very disturbed, as have the town commission in Greystones, of which I am chairman, at what we regard as signs of back-sliding on the part of management in that company. We have also been dismayed that the very excellent group who are pressing rail electrification have not been able to get unequivocal promises or undertakings from Iarnród Éireann that they will fulfil the promise the Government made.  I would ask the Minister in this very short contribution to ensure that when that £80 million is spent, the improved facilities which were promised by the Government &mdash; and welcomed and campaigned for by Deputies on all sides of this House &mdash; are provided, that the company fulfil their side of the bargain and put in additional rolling stock.  If time permitted I would say more about Deputy Yates's new found interest in this area.</P>

      <P>It is up to every speaker to draw attention to the running down of the railway service in his or her own area.  I shall spend most of my time dealing with the matter of the Galway-Dublin <Col N="1615" /> line.  It is important that we are having a public debate on this issue at a time when there is an obvious decline in the railway service.  I speak from personal knowledge as a regular traveller on the Galway-Dublin line.  Because of the decline in that service people began to see their was a danger &mdash; this has been referred to by Deputy Roche &mdash; of the line being run down to an uneconomic state.  Up to a few years ago it was impossible to get a seat on a train &mdash; on the Galway-Dublin line but that is no longer the case.  Many seats are vacant now because of the inadequate and uncertain service provided on the line in the past year.  If one has to be at a certain place at a certain time but is constantly late, one will eventually decide not to use the service in question.  If the number of people using the line is reduced dramatically over a period of one or two years the management of Iarnród Éireann might say it was an uneconomical line and, consequently, there would be a danger of its being closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a scare concerning the Galway line when, a few years ago, a new station was required in Athlone.  Instead of replacing the old station on the western side of the Shannon a modern station was built on the eastern side of the river.  This indicated that if in five or ten year's time a new bridge was required across the Shannon, costing perhaps £10 million or £15 million, the management might say the Galway line was uneconomical and would discontinue it at Athlone.  That became an issue of public debate.  Our spokesman on transport, Deputy Ivan Yates, attended an open meeting in Galway which was very well attended and where a very useful and helpful debate took place.  Subsequent to that I was part of a deputation from Galway Corporation who met with the former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  He was able to give us an assurance that there was no danger of lines being closed, since the Government had realised there was a problem, £1 million would be pumped in immediately to the <Col N="1616" /> Galway-Dublin line as a gesture of the Government's support for the railway system and that expenditure in the next EC programme would be redressed in favour of the railway.  It is extraordinary that in the five year EC capital operational programme £1 billion has been spent on roads and only £18 million on railways.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Galway-Dublin line the position is that from Dublin to Portarlington there is continuous welded rail and for the remainder of the journey there is only a small section of continuous welded rail which makes the journey uncertain.  If money was not to be ploughed into the railways during the next few years there was a danger &mdash; what some speakers have said about scaremongering &mdash; that railways would be run down and closed as has happened previously in our history.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stafford said one could not have a more pleasant journey than that from Dublin to Galway.  The only aspect I would quibble with is that if I were to travel from Galway today by train and return this evening the cost would be £10 whereas if I travelled from Dublin to Galway it would cost £22.  That is an extraordinary difference.  It encourages people to travel from Galway to Dublin to do their shopping but there is no encouragement whatever for the person travelling from Dublin to Galway to spend a day on the beach or to view the scenery which Deputy Stafford referred to.  That problem must be redressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate on the run down of our railway system because now everybody, including the Government, is aware we could not continue in the direction in which we were going.  I welcome the commitment by the former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and I presume the new Minister Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn who is from my own constituency, will take up the campaign we have started.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree completely with the Fine Gael proposals outlined by my colleague, Deputy Yates, for a ten year development programme for the <Col N="1617" /> Irish rail network.  It is an appalling aspect of Government policy that they did not apply to the EC for funding for the development or maintenance of the rail network in Ireland.  That is an incredible statistic for any government to try to defend.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McCormack and others have said, we all become parochial on issues such as this.  The railways with which I am most familiar is the infamous Sligo-Dublin line.  As a frequent user of that service it is disheartening when the train stops at numerous locations on the line because of difficulties with the line and the signals.  It reminds me of the infamous Percy French song, &ldquo;Are you right there Michael......&rdquo; I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is a gentleman who appreciates theatre but I do not know whether Standing Orders would allow for a song in the House but I will not push it.  Certainly that song &mdash; if I could sing &mdash; would sum up the condition of the Sligo-Dublin rail line at this stage. Percy French was 50 years ahead of his time because when he wrote the words he must have been thinking of the non development of the service into the west and north west.</P>
      <P>I hope the new Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communication, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, is successful in obtaining funding from the EC.  She gave a commitment in the House last evening that she would try to obtain such funding. I sincerely request her to give priority to the Sligo-Dublin line.  My colleague, Deputy Nealon, outlined for the House last evening that the first train from Dublin to Sligo which ran in 1836 was actually faster than the present day train. That gives an indication of the development of the rail service and is another poignant statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speed on the line last year was 50 miles per hour, it is reduced to 40 miles per hour this year and next year, I presume, it will be just 30 miles per hour.  If we proceed on that basis we will be at a full stop in three years time.  In that case the services of Deputies Belton, Nealon or myself might not be available to House <Col N="1618" /> and that could be of grave consequence to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give priority to the Sligo-Dublin line when funding becomes available to allow for the provision of automatic signalling facilities, a continuous welded line and new rolling stock.  It is because the present rail service is so unsatisfactory that we are not able to tap the potential of the tourism industry in the west and north-west, in particular in Sligo, Leitrim and Longford.  I hope therefore that the Taoiseach will use his good offices to have this line brought up to an acceptable standard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Reynolds stole some of my opening lines but the words of the famous Percy French song &ldquo;Are you right there Michael .... do you think we will be there before the night&rdquo; could be paraphrased in relation to north Dublin to read &ldquo;Do you think we will be there before we lose our jobs&rdquo;.  According to local history, in 1900 the train journey, by steam engine, from Malahide took 22 minutes but nowadays with modern technology, according to the present timetable, the journey takes approximately 20 minutes.  This represents an improvement of two minutes, or approximately 1.3 seconds per year since 1900.  If we had that improvement it would not be too bad but the story is altogether different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many times throughout the year the service on the commuter line from Balbriggan to Dublin is delayed by up to 35 to 40 minutes either because the train breaks down outside the station, of DART connections, signal faults, high winds, leaves, ice or flooding along the line, seagulls flying into signal boxes, vandalism, sick drivers and problems with <Col N="1619" /> Telecom Éireann.  I am not making up these complaints, they are the reasons given to me in relation to the problems experienced with that line.</P>
    <P>Thousands of commuters use that line from Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock each day.  They pay a higher price for their seven day commuter ticket than those lucky enough to be living near the DART line, and for what?  They are provided with an unreliable, inadequate and partial service.  Furthermore, there are no trains on a Sunday.  Therefore, those who buy a seven day ticket are limited to using it on six days only.  A limited service is provided on a Saturday and the first train leaves too late for those who have to work on that day, such as those who work in shops, restaurants and hotels. Indeed, the service was so bad this winter &mdash; this is hard to believe &mdash; that Iarnród Éireann were forced to send fax messages to employers to confirm that their employees would arrive late at work because the train had been delayed to ensure that employees would keep their jobs.</P>
    <P>The locomotives used are over 30 years old; they are so old that maintenance staff have to travel on the train each day. Having listened to Deputy Roche, I now know where some of our trains go.  At weekends, and in particular bank holiday weekends, trains on that commuter line are cancelled so that trains can service inter-city rail links.  That is no way to run a rail service.  What sort of country do we have when trains are borrowed from one line when one runs out of them on another? All over the world cities are examining ways to provide light rail services, for environmental, efficiency and social reasons, in an effort to move a large volume of people quickly and cheaply.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State who is present &mdash; I congratulate him on his appointment &mdash; to proceed urgently with his plans to provide a light rail system in Dublin city and county.  I ask him to make provision for a link to Dublin Airport as this must be the only city in Europe without a direct rail link to its airport. <Col N="1620" /> I ask him to consider the possibility of providing a rail link to Swords which currently has a population of 22,500 with the potential to increase to 39,500.  Yet, it has no rail link even though Dublin County Council have set aside valleys of land for such a link.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister of State that he should use his good offices at European Community level to obtain the funding that is available for mobile assets.  I should like to point out to him that the former Minister in his Department, Deputy Séamus Brennan, clearly stated in a briefing document presented to the British-Irish parliamentary group that &ldquo;as far as the Irish Government were concerned, the Belfast-Dublin link was not competing with domestic interests for funding or priority&rdquo;.  He gave a commitment that the Belfast-Dublin link was due to be upgraded.  I hope the Minister of State will take the message from this debate that we should be looking at our rail links all over the country and recognise that this is the mode of transport that we should opt for in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity, even though my time is short, to speak to this motion.  I congratulate Deputy Yates for taking the initiative and raising this important and pressing issue in the House.  I also wish to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Deputy from Longford, I have been extremely concerned for the past year about the future of the Dublin-Sligo line.  The reason I am so concerned is that approximately £2 million was to have been spent on that line last year but for various reasons this did not happen.  Naturally enough, there is an uproar about this issue.  Commuters on that line have been provided with a very bad service during the past few years through no fault of the employees of Iarnród Éireann but due to an outdated signalling system which should have been replaced years ago.  As a result, there are many delays. When this money was not spent last year people began to realise that if the trend <Col N="1621" /> continued the future of the line would be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Government side accusing us of scaremongering. When Mr. David Waters, the chairman of Iarnród Éireann, attended a meeting of Longford County Council he told us loud and clear that this was a matter for the politicians and that Iarnród Éireann did not have enough money.  This issue has been highlighted by my colleagues, Deputy Gerry Reynolds and Deputy Nealon who could be described as the &ldquo;Boxcar Willie&rdquo; of the Dublin-Sligo line. He has been referring to it for some time now.</P>
    <P>While there is no point in dwelling too much on our mistakes we have got to learn from them.  If extra funding from Europe is spent on the railways we will be making progress.  Everyone agrees that it simply does not make sense to allow all traffic enter Dublin by road.  The counties I am talking about cover almost one-third of the country &mdash; Westmeath, Longford, Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and I give a guarantee that if there is no rail service serving that area politicians will argue in this House for the rail service.  However, we do have this facility but it has been allowed deteriorate. My message therefore to the Minister of State, and his Department, is that they should make sure an application is submitted to obtain these funds and that the Government should match them so that we can guarantee the future of the Dublin-Sligo line.  It is essential that this service is maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak in support of the motion for a number of reasons, one, because rail plays a crucial role as a mode of public transport and because it also plays a vital role in the transportation of goods, carrying everything from bulk quantities of cement from Arigna to transporting dangerous and toxic chemicals. It is crucial that the public, as the fee-paying passengers, can feel that rail traffic is safe.  It is of equal importance that the wider public are assured that the railway system can safely carry highly dangerous chemicals like ammonia and <Col N="1622" /> acrilo-nitrate.  Imagine the catastrophe if even one of the containers carrying dangerous chemicals which travel regularly from Dublin to Asahi left the rails.</P>
      <P>All over Europe huge investments are being made in railway lines with the aim of getting people and goods to their destination faster. In Ireland our trains are going more slowly.  On some of our lines speeds have been progressively reduced for safety reasons.  Brendan O'Dowda singing the Percy French song, &ldquo;Are you right there Michael, are you right, do you think that we'll be there before tonight&rdquo; mentioned so often in the House tonight, could well be the anthem of many passengers. What sort of backward policy do we have when we compare the Percy French type railway network with, for example, the system in Europe like the bullet train in Japan and the record breaking TGV system in France?  I should also mention the light rail systems of Grenoble and Manchester.  There must be greater investment in rail at the expense of roads.  We must march with the times and recognise that there are many tried, trusted and proven methods of conveying passengers and goods by rail.  We should invest in a light rail system for Dublin and secure and upgrade the main inter-city lines.</P>
      <P>We must not make fools of ourselves in Europe by rejecting European funds to, for example, upgrade the Dublin-Belfast line, particularly when Northern Ireland Railways are willing to make their contribution.  We should shake ourselves free of the old ideological motivated antipathy to rail, felt and expressed by successive Ministers for Transport, that because it is public it deserves to die and that if it dies somehow or other there will be a saving to the public purse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of the various combined transport techniques in operation in Europe which can play such an important role in the transportation of goods in this country?  If she is, I ask her to put her knowledge into action.  It must now be clear to everyone that the rail system has reached a very critical stage and that unless there is proper investment <Col N="1623" /> much of the system will decline rapidly and will almost certainly face closure.  We are paying a high price for the failures of successive Governments to put a reasonable level of investment in the railway system.  Indeed, if you exclude the DART, the only parts of the railway system which approach anything like acceptable standards in terms of rolling stock and the condition of the permanent way are the Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Belfast lines.</P>
    <P>It cannot be that the Government were unaware of the need for more investment. In every recent year when they published their annual report, CIE warned of the deteriorating situation and set out their case for increased investment. Only last November the managing director of Irish Rail, Mr. Dave Waters, put it in stark terms when he said: &ldquo;If the company cannot renew its assets there will, inevitably, be a downgrading of lines&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Railway tracks needing immediate attention include the Sligo, Westport, Rosslare and Tralee lines.  This will not come as any news to the hundreds of thousands of commuters who have had to endure lengthening journey times, ancient and decrepit carriages and more and more frequent breakdowns.  Conditions on the Sligo line have been particularly bad; those in the Galway line are not much better.  Many people in Sligo and along the route served by the Sligo train are convinced that a political decision has been made to allow the line to deteriorate to such an extent that there will be no alternative to closure.  When you look at the evidence their fears are understandable.  The best overall speed on the line is now down to 42 miles per hour, meaning a journey of three and a quarter hours.</P>
    <P>The importance of the railway connection to towns like Galway and Sligo are illustrated by the proportion of commuters carried by rail.  The rail line carries 49 per cent of all passenger traffic going from Sligo to Dublin and 19 per cent of traffic going in the opposite direction. The figures for Galway are 45 per <Col N="1624" /> cent and 22 per cent respectively.  If the rail lines are allowed to continue to deteriorate &mdash; or worse, close down &mdash; it will be a body blow to these areas.</P>
    <P>Almost 35 years on, tens of thousands of commuters, trapped daily in traffic jams on the south side of Dublin, have reason to curse those who made the decision to close the old Harcourt Street line.  More than three decades later, the Government have been forced to look at that decision again and consider plans for reopening the line, initially as a busway and later as a light rail system.  Let us ensure that the same short-sighted attitude which forced the closure of the Harcourt Street line is not allowed to deprive the people of Sligo and Galway of their rail lines.</P>
    <P>There are economic, social and environmental reasons for preserving and developing the railway network. When proper investment is made, railways are probably the most efficient, reliable and safest way of travelling.  The environmental value of the railway should not be underestimated.  Many small towns and villages throughout the country are being choked to death by the level of motor traffic.  The aim must be to be to get more people off the roads and onto the rail system.  This will not be done unless we have a system which is safe, reliable and economic.</P>
    <P>A train can carry several hundred people yet the fuel used will be only a fraction of that used by the cars required to carry the same number of people.  The pollution caused by a train is insignificant compared to the environmental damage caused by hundreds of cars ploughing through small villages.  The value of the railways in regard to freight is even more dramatic.  Many of our roads are simply not suitable for the sort of heavy goods vehicles which are now used for freight. People who live along the routes used by the monsters will testify to the environmental damage caused by noise, vibration and fumes, not to mention the psychological damage caused to householders. The argument for getting freight off the road and on the railways is even stronger than for passengers.  Unfortunately,  <Col N="1625" /> we do not have an extensive rail network but we must protect and develop what we have and ensure that it is used to the greatest degree possible.</P>
    <P>Rail systems are not cheap and they cost a lot of money to maintain.  It is labour intensive and demanding and a high level of maintenance and inspection is required to ensure the highest safety standards.  However, they are worth it. Comments are sometimes made &mdash; often by representatives of private transport interests &mdash; about the amount of public money spent in subsidising the rail system.  Of course Irish Rail have to maintain the permanent way, one of the most expensive aspects of the rail system, but private hauliers do not have to pay for the construction or maintenance of roads or environmental damage.</P>
    <P>We should not let this debate pass without referring to the Dublin-Belfast rail line which has faced its own unique problems in recent years because of the systematic attacks on it by the Provisional IRA.  A month rarely passes without a bomb attack on the rail line and bomb scares are even more frequent.  It is, of course, ironic, that these attacks on a vital link between Dublin and Belfast are carried out by an organisation which claim to want to unite Ireland, yet they keep us apart.  Every attack places in jeopardy the lives of the passengers, staff on the railways and employees on the train.</P>
    <P>While the standards on the Dublin-Belfast line are better than those on most other lines it is a particular important link which requires adequate finance and developmnet.  The EC has made it clear that money is available from the Community to upgrade the line.  The authorities in Northern Ireland have made it clear that they want this to go ahead but there seems to be some reluctance down here to take up the option of EC money. We must ensure that we do not bring about, through neglect, what the Provos have been unable to achieve through persistent bombing, that is, closure of the line.  I thank the Fine Gael group for giving me those ten minutes which were much appreciated.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I wish to thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their messages of goodwill.  Some of the contributions made by Deputies across the Floor had a great musical content. However, they all seemed to be set to the same tune.  I wonder if it is a case of great minds thinking alike or perhaps of fools seldom differing.</P>
      <P>In supporting the amendment to this motion, I endorse fully the comments made last evening by my colleagues, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, concerning the Government's commitment to the rail network and general policy on the railways.</P>
      <P>The State subvention of over £940 million to Irish Rail since 1980 is more than adequate testimony of the Government's support for the railway system in Ireland. The decision to conduct an urgent strategic review of the future investment needs and resources required for the railways is the most practical and sensible means of identifying the options for the future of the railway retwork, as well as the costs, investment requirements and funding possibilities, including EC funding, of all these options.</P>
      <P>The result of the strategic study will comprise an essential element in the formulation of the spending programme to be drawn up for the next phase of Structural Funds and the new cohesion fund.  As the Minister has made clear, it is intended to seek a greater share of significantly increased EC funds for public transport generally and for the railway network in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer subvention to CIE for 1992 amounts to £108 million, of which approximately £90 million is being allocated to Irish Rail.  This includes £45 million <Col N="1627" /> which will be spent on the maintenance and upkeep of infrastructure including tracks, sleepers, signalling systems, bridges, level crossings, etc., and a further £45 million to support the operation of socially necessary services which are not fully commercial, and to meet interest and other costs, including the interest on loans taken out to fund the DART.  The allocation of these resources is a matter entirely for the operational and commercial judgment of CIE and Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Exchequer is under financial pressure, with many urgent and competing demands for funding across the spectrum of the State's activities, the continuing allocation of large amounts of taxpayer's money to the railway network leaves no room for doubt about the importance which the Government attach to public transport which is a vital element in the social, economic and commercial life of this country.</P>
    <P>Public transport, in common with other sectors has to deal with the reality of reduced availability of Exchequer funding.  In response to these pressures, Iarnród Éireann have improved competitiveness, efficiency and cost effectiveness in the provision of services.  In these difficult circumstances, Iarnród Éireann deserve credit and recognition for their achievements over the past few years which have seen passenger and freight volumes increases.</P>
    <P>The Government do not have any &ldquo;hidden agenda&rdquo; to starve the rail network of investment or close the railways by subterfuge or deliberate lack of financial support.  It has been repeatedly confirmed in recent times that there are no proposals before the Minister or the Department for the clousre or downgrading of any part of the rail network, and this remains the position.</P>
    <P>As part of the continuing upgrading of equipment on the rail network, Irish Rail are engaged on a major re-signalling investment programme on the line between Malahide and Drogheda at a cost of £3.4 million.  The company have also commenced plans for the replacement, <Col N="1628" /> with EC assistance, of gantries at Limerick, Sligo, Cork and Dundalk.  In addition, Irish Rail are investing £17 million on new railcars to be used on a number of commuter rail lines.</P>
    <P>I would also add that the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications is currently finalising consideration of a number of major public transport projects, including the provision of a commuter rail service on the south-west rail corridor, including Clondalkin; upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast line, about which I am sure Deputy Owen will be very pleased, provision of a rail link to the Belview harbour development in Waterford and work on the restoration of the former Harcourt Street line.  The provision of EC assistance for these projects is also being pursued.</P>
    <P>There has been much media comment of late arising from the outcome of a recent study commissioned by the previous Minister and the chairman of CIE on the rail safety situation in Irish Rail. I wish to take this opportunity to allay any fears the travelling public may have concerning the safety of rail operations in Ireland.  The consultant's study concluded that the railway is being operated to an acceptable level of safety. However, the consultant's report also includes a number of recommendations for action to improve safety standards in Irish Rail.  Most of the recommendations relate to improvements in the application of existing rules and regulations, as well as to improved training and work practices. Implementation of the report's recommendations is already in progress within Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann at all times operate services on a basis designed to ensure optimum safety standards.  I understand from the chairman of CIE that the company have detailed and extensive procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of railway services at all times, as is required under the Transport Act, 1950, and other relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposal to include responsibility for rail within the remit of the proposed National Roads Authority, I do not feel that such a move would <Col N="1629" /> entail any practical or administrative advantage.  The National Roads Authority will have the clear objective of improving the national roads network and co-ordinating the activities of local authorities throughout the State which have responsibilities in that regard.  No such co-ordinating requirement arises in relation to the railways, as we already have a single organisation for the rail network, operating under the aegis of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.  Transferring some element of responsibility for rail to the National Roads Authority would only cloud the issues, diverting the attention and energy of the Authority from their roads mandate and inhibiting the pursuit of an integrated and coherent public transport policy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to take this opportunity of thanking all Deputies for their valuable contributions to this debate.  I urge the House to endorse the Government's policy, and I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>In concluding this debate, I should like at the outset to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment. As a Deputy who comes from a neighbouring constituency I wish him well.  I believe he must be particularly pleased about the provision of a rail link to the Belview harbour development.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I was particularly interested in the contributions by the Fianna Fáil backbench TDs.  When Deputy Roche did not attack me on this Private Members' motion I knew I was on to a sure and certain winner.  Even he had to agree that this debate is worthy of full consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate Fine Gael sought a Government commitment on a number of specific things.  These may be classified as new departures.  First, we sought the segregation of the funding of the track from the railway company.  As I said last night, there is an EC Directive which I believe will mandate us to move in this <Col N="1630" /> direction.  Second, we sought a clear commitment that inter-city rail services would be funded from EC moneys in the next tranche of funding and if cohesion funds are made available in 1993 that they would be made available for this purpose. We believe that those moneys should be spent on continuous welded rail and automatic computerised signalling throughout the inter-city network.</P>
    <P>In general, I was pleased with the debate and the Minister's disposition last night.  However, one thing disturbed me deeply and as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, I am not one who is easily disturbed.  This related to one of the Minister's statements.  I know that Ministers are busy people and that scripts can be thrust into their hands but I was particulalry disturbed when the Minister, in referring to the lengthy, strategic, detailed study being commissioned, said: &ldquo;I will consider whether any further work either by way of the appointment of a railway commission or engagement of consultants or some other combination of both is desirable before bringing this matter before the Government&rdquo;.  As I understand it the Government's position is that not only is a strategic study to be carried out but when we receive the results of that study, a commission, consultants, another committee or a task force will consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to misinterpret her.  This is what I call paralysis by analysis, and it is unacceptable.  What is required is an investment plan.  We have set out very simply the amount that needs to be provided: £42 million for the Dublin-Belfast line, including £33 million for the track and £9 million for rolling stock.  The amount necessary for radial routes from Dublin to all parts of the country is £240 million.  That would provide for the track, continuous welded rail and computerised signalling.  It will take time to carry out that work but it will require a clear political direction.  As David Waters has said to every local <Col N="1631" /> authority and group of public representatives who are interested, this requires not another study but a political commitment, and this is what we have sought.</P>
      <P>Irish Rail have done an enormously successful job in relation to passenger numbers and they have enormous potential to increase their freight market.  Some 10 per cent of the total freight market is carried by Irish Rail.  That includes mostly bulk carriers &mdash; oil, cement, fertilisers and so on.  However their potential is 17 per cent or 18 per cent of the total freight market and that potential should be realised.</P>
      <P>The traffic analysis on the main corridors shows a clear preference, within the context of public transport, for trains. In 1990 a detailed survey was carried out of the seven inter-urban corridors, from Dublin-Belfast right around to Dublin-Rosslare. That survey showed that 24 per cent of people travel by train although trains are sometimes late and, as with the Dublin-Sligo line, the service is unreliable. That is eight times more than the number who use bus Éireann and eight times more than the number who use the private bus service.  Very often a return journey by private bus is £5 while the same journey by rail is £15.  Similarly the break-down of numbers travelling on specific corridors shows the percentage of those who travel by train on the following routes: Cork to Dublin, 72 per cent; Tralee to Dublin, 62 per cent; Limerick to Dublin, 51 per cent and Wexford to Dublin, 18 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Rail's investment plan would reduce the travelling time of trains.  For example, on the Dublin-Rosslare line the journey would be reduced by 25 minutes. We all know that the volume of road traffic is increasing and Irish Rail should take action to improve the railways.  On the Dublin-Silgo line there could be a saving of 40 minutes, reducing the journey to two hours 40 minutes.  On the Dublin-Westport line the journey could be reduced by half an hour to three hours and the journey from Tralee to Dublin could be reduced by 25 minutes to three hours 15 minutes.  This is a good plan and <Col N="1632" /> all that is required is a political commitment.</P>
    <P>As regards track renewal, Irish Rail have clearly spelled out that they are behind in their investment programme and that at the present rate of funding it will take until the year 2010 to even maintain the track not to speak of providing continuous welded rail or computerised signalling.  In relation to signalling what is needed is a computerised approach.  At present the system in operation is called ETS or electric token system. This system is so bizarre that at some stations when people get off the train the driver has to put out his hand for a round rod to ensure that there is a link on the line.  This system is 100 years old and is totally out of date.</P>
    <P>In relation to class 001 locomotives which have a life expectancy of 40 years, 44 of them were commissioned in 1955. That means that by the year 1995 they will be puffed out and will be unable to do the job.  Irish Rail, in their present straitjacket, cannot finance their commitments for rolling stock.  They should be relieved of the burden of paying for the infrastructure and, out of their own resources and the social subvention, they would be able to meet the need for the rolling stock.  Irish Rail deserve enormous credit for the work they have done in pioneering services at a time of no political support.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly turn again to the safety issue.  I have not said that the railways are unsafe.  I have repeated what has been said by the Kennedy-Henderson Group from Surrey in England who reported on 3 December.  Their executive summary is included in the report which, I regret the Minister has declined to publish. I quote three short sections in relation to their conclusions:</P>
    <P>In comparison to British Rail (BR), IE's safety performance would appear to be lower in key areas such as passenger and staff safety.</P>
    <P>The condition of IE assets is declining through lack of investment which is beginning to affect reliability.</P>
    <P>It then goes on to make the telling statement which is my key point: &ldquo;Today's <Col N="1633" /> reliability problem could become tomorrow's safety problem&rdquo;.  If the Minister continues with her predecessor's policy of neglecting the railways and getting no support from EC funding she should not be surprised if there is a major derailment as a result of a fracture on a line.  The unfortunate passengers in three or four years time will suffer the consequences of the failure to invest in continuous welded rail.  The ultimate sentence in this report is that IE &mdash; Iarnród Éireann &mdash; is neither absolutely safe nor absolutely unsafe. The fact that Iarnród Éireann is not absolutely safe is of the deepest concern to me and my party.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made by the Minister in her reply to the fact that we do not want to combine the National Roads Authority with the National Roads and Rail Authority.  There is no single ministry for transport in this country.  The Department of the Environment perceived as a spending Department, have to fund a massive roads programme.  The Department of the Marine, which is responsible for harbours and shipping, get funding for a separate leg of the transport area.  The Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications are seen as an administrative Department dealing with liberalisation of bus competition and aviation issues.  What is needed is a system similar to that in operation in virtually all European countries whereby one transport department deals with aviation, roads, haulage, harbours, shipping <Col N="1634" /> and so on.  In that way we could have an integrated plan and there would be fair play in relation to EC investment.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for a political commitment. We do not need more studies, commissions, reports or analyses.  We have asked that Irish Rail be given an even break.  There would be an enormous short term benefit for investments in this area in that Irish Rail would save £3 million per annum on the `band aid' temporary repairs which have to be carried out on the railway lines at present.  We need a corporate plan for Irish Rail, a plan to ensure a secure future for the railways, for the 5,700 employees of Irish Rail and the 25 million passengers who use the system.  That secure future is within a framework of a solid investment plan that will for the first time utilise EC funds and will for the first time say that there is to be equality between roads and rail because it is the same infrastructure. As I said last night, the simplest example I can use is that for the 800 buses in our capital city of Dublin, a sum of £250,000 is paid for the privilege of using the road network, yet Irish Rail has to pay £45 million for using their surface, the railway track.</P>
    <P>I commend our motion to the House. I thank all the other Opposition parties for their support.  I believe that it is only through such a corporate plan that we can secure the future of our railways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity of raising this <Col N="1637" /> matter on the Adjournment this evening. The matter concerns 31 employees of a film animation studio in Dún Laoghaire who have not been paid wages since 22 October last and whose employment has now ceased.</P>
      <P>Originally the film studio was known as Emerald City Animation Studio and closed down in March 1991.  It was reopened in August 1991 by a Dorset-based company called Fairford Films, the directors of which are a Mr. Redford and a Mr. Andrew Holford.  Thirty-one employees were recruited, most of them former employees of Emerald City Studios.  At first the company appeared to be doing well but, towards the end of October last, their employees were informed there would be a delay in the payment of that week's wages, the directors stating they were experiencing difficulty in transferring funds from Switzerland and the United States.  The staff expected this to be a short-lived problem. However, it dragged on for another week and yet another.  The staff kept inquiring and the directors kept assuring them that the money was on the way.  For example on 6 November last Mr. Redford wrote to the staff stating that he expected the problem to be resolved with the minimum delay.  It dragged on to Christmas, staff continuing to work on the promise that they would get their wages.  The studio did not re-open after Christmas.  To date, the 31 employees have not been paid for their work between 22 October and Christmas.</P>
      <P>I became aware of the problem in early January when I wrote to the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Labour. I also wrote to the company.  On 21 January last Mr. Holford replied to me that &ldquo;solicitors acting for our funders confirm money will be available for us to pay staff before the end of this month&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was nearly six weeks ago and the staff have still not been paid.  A similar promise was given recently to one of the local newspapers.  Yet no money has been produced.  It appears to me that the employees of this studio have been grossly exploited, the company having ripped off their labour for two months. The company have spun them a fallacious <Col N="1638" /> yarn about money being held up in Switzerland, the Isle of Man, Norway and the United States.  The company have now disappeared.</P>
    <P>I am now requesting the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take action under the Companies Act, to send in an Examiner, because I believe this studio is still a viable business concern.  I appeal to him to take whatever action he can to ensure that the employees are paid the wages due to them, for which they worked between October and Christmas. This company, in quite a disgraceful, exploitative manner, have disappeared without paying the staff the wages for which they had worked for two months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware of the significant investigative provisions of the Companies Act, 1990, arising from the recent inspection activities.  Section 8 of the 1990 Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the appointment by the High Court, on the application of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of one or more inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company.  The recently concluded investigation into Siúicre Éireann and certain related companies was carried out in accordance with this section.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Act Provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the appointment, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of an inspector to investigate the ultimate beneficial ownership of one or more companies. The ongoing investigation into certain named companies involved in the Telecom Affair was initiated on the basis of this provision.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the 1990 Act provides a mechanism whereby parties interested in the affairs of a company, for example, a significant shareholder, can apply to the High Court to have an inspector appointed to look into the affairs of the company.  As far as I am aware, this provision in the 1990 Act has not been used to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Companies Registration Office have confirmed to me that Fairford Films Limited are not listed on the register of companies.  In addition, the CRO have indicated to me that the company are not <Col N="1639" /> listed on the external register.  A company incorporated outside the State, if they are establishing a place of business in the State, may obtain a listing on the external register.  However, there is no obligation on such a firm to register.</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing, it is possible that the company are, for example, a UK company trading in Ireland.  While this is a legal practice, Irish company law does not necessarily apply.  There is also the possibility that the company have been passing themselves off as a limited liability company in contravention of section 381 of the Companies Act, 1963.  It has not been possible, in the short time available to me, to identify the precise status of the company.  If the Deputy is agreeable, I would be glad to arrange to have this aspect double-checked and the outcome formally communicated to him. The relevant industries division of my Department have indicated that they have no data on the company, given that firms in the film-making business do not qualify for grant assistance for development purposes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to the fact that the firm's closure resulted in the loss of 31 jobs.  I should like to point out that the Minister for Labour is responsible for the legislation in this regard, namely the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1962-91, and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  In the circumstances, perhaps the Deputy might wish to pursue the situation with the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this serious matter in the House having failed to have a Private Notice Question answered on the matter yesterday.  How could a quantity of radioactive substance be left in an unattended <Col N="1640" /> vehicle so that it ended up being stolen? By the grace of God, it avoided ending up in a fire which destroyed the vehicle which was later found.  We have been told that the container was found intact close to the vehicle.  Will the Minister outline exactly the nature of the radioactive material?  I presume it was licensed under Statutory Instrument No. 166.97 which requires all such substance to be licensed by the Nuclear Energy Board. Is the Minister satisfied that an incident of this nature could have occurred with a material so licensed?  Has the Minister examined the circumstances relating to this case and is he satisfied that the regulations are adequate?  I would like the Minister to give us details of the use for which this material was intended and to clarify whether it was just good luck that there was not a more serious outcome to this grave incident.  Is the Minister taking any action to ensure that this distributor will not engage in this sort of thing again and see whether there is need for more general changes in relation to our controls in this area arising from this serious incident?</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Flaherty, I wished to raise this matter in the House yesterday as a Private Notice Question, but unfortunately it was turned down.  As far as I know, we are dealing with a very dangerous substance called Iridium 192. If this box had gone on fire or had been opened by an unauthorised person it would undoubtedly have been a major public health hazard.  We all know the dangers of radiation, particularly in cancer-relatd illnesses.  There is no doubt that the public were very seriously at risk in this case.  I hope the Minister will deal with a number of factors in his reply.  It appears that the security firm involved were in breach of the regulations.  I understand from the Nuclear Energy Board that there must at all times be personal contact between an Iridium container and the staff of the company. Apparently the Iridium was in the van and the two people in the van went back into the factory for a few minutes, whereupon the van was driven off.  I suspect that the van was not even locked.  It is likely that the keys were left in the <Col N="1641" /> ignition.  I hope that was not the case, because if it is, it demonstrates an extremely lax attitude by the company.</P>
      <P>All these matters will have to be investigated. Another matter that might be more germane to the case is that I understand that the purpose for which this material is used is to test gas pipes and other industrial applicances.  Surely there must be a safer and better way to conduct this testing without using such a dangerous material.  Perhaps it is necessary, but that is the sort of issue we should be looking at.  We should not use such dangerous materials unless it is absolutely necessary to do so, because mistakes will occur and there will be carelessness. The sooner we can find a safer way of doing whatever work this substance was used for, the better.</P>

      <P>The Deputies are referring to an incident on 2 March 1992, when a van was stolen in Tallaght from outside the business premises of NDT Services.  The van, when stolen, had an board an industrial radiography source.  I would like to emphasise from the outset that this container was recovered intact, there was no leakage of radioactive material and consequently no danger to the public.</P>
      <P>Under the Nuclear Energy Order, 1977, relating to the general control of radioactive substances, the Nuclear Energy Board issue licences for the custody, use, manufacture, importation, distribution, export and disposal of radioactive substances, devices and waste products.  The company whose vehicle was stolen, held such a licence from the Nuclear Energy Board.  The conditions attached to the licence include requirements that loss or theft be reported to both the Nuclear Energy Board and the Garda.</P>
      <P>Vehicles carrying radioactive sources are required to be accompanied by a qualified person and secure and safe parking must be provided for any vehicle unattended while that vehicle contains a radioactive source.  The internal operating procedures laid down by NDT Services Ltd in their radiation safety manual also stress these safety and security requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> Radioactive sources of the type in question in this incident are routinely used in the testing of a wide range of engineering components and structures, for example testing aircraft engine parts and gas pipelines.</P>
    <P>The circumstances surrounding the incident as outlined to me by the Nuclear Energy Board are as follows: at approximately 17.45 on Monday, 2 March 1992, the Nuclear Energy Bord were advised by the manager of NDT Services, a small company specialising in the testing of engineering components, that a van containing an industrial radiography source, Iridium 192, had been stolen from outside their premises in Cookstown Industrial Estate, Tallaght about 30 minutes earlier.  The company also reported that one of their employees had observed the van being driven away.  The van in question was fitted with a radio and was immediately radioed by the company with information that the van contained a radiation source which should not be touched.  However as no response was received from the van, it is not known whether information was received by the occupants of the van.</P>
    <P>The nuclear energy board immediately contacted the gardaí at Tallaght who had already been informed of the theft by the company.  The gardaí agreed to broadcast messages on national radio and TV requesting the public to report any sighting of either the van or the radioactive source container to the gardaí and not to interfere with the container.  This notice was first included in the 6.30 p.m. news bulletin on RTE.</P>
    <P>Later that evening, the board were informed by gardaí that they were investigating a report that a burnt out van had been spotted in a field near Rathcoole. This report led to a search of the area in which the gardaí, the Nuclear Energy Board and a representative from the company participated with some local assistance.  The fire brigade also assisted in the search.  Eventually, at about midnight, the van was found burnt out and the container discovered about 30 metres from the van.  The officer of the Nuclear Energy Board carried out a radiation survey which confirmed that the container was intact.  The container was then <Col N="1643" /> brought back to the offices of the company by their personnel.</P>
    <P>The radiation source was contained in a specially designed and shielded container. The container has a very high quality locking device which can only be opened with a special key.  It would be extremely difficult to break into the container which is designed to conform with the regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material and, as such, must be able to withstand a range of accidents including the ability to withstand severe fire conditions.  The container has an embossed radioactivity symbol also designed to withstand fire so that the container could be identified after a fire.  Tests have successfully been carried out to demonstrate the integrity of these radiography containers and of the ability of the radioactivity symbol to remain intact after a fire.</P>
    <P>The board have requested a full report of the incident from the licensee, from the time the vehicle was stolen until the item was recovered.  I have asked the Nuclear Energy Board to pursue the company for an immediate report and specifically to inquire into how this material was left unattended, as the first indications from the board are that it appears that in this incident the carefully laid down procedures were not followed by the company.  On receipt of this report the Nuclear Energy Board will consider what steps should be taken to improve security.</P>
    <P>I, of course, share the concern of the Deputies in this matter but I would emphasise that the emergency arose not because of the loss of this container but because of the criminal theft of a van in which the container was being held. However, there are certain aspects of the case which require clarification and I can assure the Deputies that these matters will be fully addressed in the report which I have asked to be prepared as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>May I add, in conclusion, for the information of the House that the new Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will be established very shortly.  The new institute will replace the Nuclear Energy <Col N="1644" /> Board and will have comprehensive powers under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, to deal with radiological protection matters which need to be confronted from time to time both on the international front but also in localised instances such as the Tallaght incident.</P>
    <P>I would also stress that the record in relation to the use of radioactive sources in Ireland has been excellent and the licensing arrangements of the Nuclear Energy Board have contributed to a large degree to their safe use.  The overall commitment of the companies involved to safety priorities has resulted in high standards being observed by the industry in Ireland.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Driving Tests Backlog.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise the issue of the inordinate waiting time for driving test applicants to be tested.  This is an issue of grave national importance and causes concern right across the country although the waiting time for driving tests varies from district to district.  Nationally, I understand, 30,000 applicants are waiting for a test and a three month waith in most areas is not uncommon; sometimes it is more.</P>
      <P>The implications for the applicant of having to wait this length are clear.  First, we must consider the cost of motor insurance.  We have debated at length the tremendous cost of motor insurance, particularly for young drivers.  Indeed, the cost is prohibitive for many people for whom this is a basic essential, the ability to drive a motor vehicle by a rural based community.  In addition there is a loading on the insurance premium because the person has a provisional licence.  That person may be able to drive a vehicle and pass the test but cannot be tested due to the shortage of testers throughout the country.  This also has serious implications for road safety. Some people may be driving on a provisional licence who should not be on the road.  A speedy road test would give a clear indication of who can drive and it would put more pressure on people to take proper coaching in driving so that the skills could be imparted in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> The question of employment is germane to this issue.  When we are looking at every avenue to create jobs, it seems to me that the employment of additional testers would create some jobs because we have the equivalent of 30,000 hours of work ready to be done and paid for in advance by the people who have to put their money on the line when applying for the test.  There is a certain complacency in Government in crowing over the fact that the numbers have been reduced in recent years.  This is not a new problem and I am not suggesting it is.  We have had waiting lists for driving tests for many years.  The situation was so bad many years ago that licences were issued without proper testing.  That is completely and totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There is a solution to the problem the appointment of adequate driver testers. the situation in one test centre was outlined for me today and I am sure it is replicated across the country.  The existing testers are required to do nine extra tests on overtime at weekends.  They are required to work this overtime on two Saturdays each month and the cost, including overnight accommodation, is £138.50 per night.  This means that 18 tests are provided at a cost of £277. Against this, temporary driving testers who are employed on contract are paid £251 per week.  They are required to carry out 44 tests and this is obviously much more cost-effective.  I appeal to the Minister to address this question as a matter of urgency and allow sufficient testers to be employed, thus giving employment to some of the 276,000 unemployed people who crave work and at the same time reducing the unacceptable waiting time for driving tests and improve the safety standards in our roads.  I hope the Minister will give that undertaking tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that there was an unacceptable waiting time for driving tests back in 1990.  This was due primarily to the fact that we had too few testers as a result of the ban on recruitment to the Civil Service which had been in place for some time.  An aggravating factor was the continuing increase in the level of applications being received.  The position <Col N="1646" /> now, however, is dramatically different. The average waiting period for a driving test has been reduced from 47 weeks in November 1990 to about 11 weeks at present.  The number of applicants waiting for driving tests has been reduced in the same period from over 68,000 to 31,600 at the end of February this year. Of this later figure, 10,300 had been given appointments for tests and a further 9,000 had previously been given at least one appointment and had cancelled.  The nett figure of those waiting for an appointment, is, therefore, only 12,300 which is equal to the intake for only about five weeks.  In effect, all of those who were waiting for first appointments at the end of February had been waiting for five weeks at most and they could expect to be tested within a further period of about six weeks.</P>
      <P>This cannot be represented as a totally unacceptable backlog.  In addition, anyone requiring an early or urgent test is readily accommodated.  This position has been achieved through a programme of recruitment and training of additional permanent testers and the hiring of temporary testers on a contract basis specifically to eliminate the backlog of applications. The position is being kept under close review to ensure that the rate of testing is maintained at an adequate level.</P>
      <P>Testing is conducated by a corps of 63 testers at 47 test centres throughout the country.  Not all of these centres have permanently headquartered testers because the numbers of applications at particular centres may not be sufficient to keep a tester fuly occupied.  In other centres, the staff is increased from time to time to deal with peaks in the levels of activity.  Rotation of testers between centres is also needed to provide alternative testers for repeat tests and to protect the testers themselves against undue pressure due to over familiarity.  All of this means that while the average waiting period is currently about 11 weeks, local variations can occur.  Every effort is being made, however, to keep waiting periods in all areas as close to the national average as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to repeat what I said earlier &mdash; there is no undue delay <Col N="1647" /> in providing driving tests for applicants. The 11 weeks I mentioned is not unreasonable.  In addition, experience has shown that about five weeks' notice of appointment is the minimum required to avoid an unacceptable level of cancellations by applicants.  I can assure the House that I will monitor the situation closely and ensure that whatever action is necessary will be taken to maintain an acceptable level of service.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his new appointment.  This is a serious issue which I have raised on a previous occasion.  It relates to the Stella Maris Convent at Foynes which embraces Shanagolden and other immediate catchment areas.  The Sisters of Mercy announced in 1991 that they had decided to withdraw their service from 1995.  The school has 230 pupils.  A formal proposal has been submitted to the County Limerick vocational education committee to acquire the premises of the Stella Maris School at Foynes and also to embrace the existing vocational education committee school at Shanagolden which has 50 pupils.  The vocational education committee would like to have a community college including both schools but require the consent of the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>It is essential that an early decision be made because parents are now considering where their children will attend in September next and they will have to know if the full five-year cycle will be available.  I am aware that the Minister authorised an architect and an inspector to visit the school on Friday, 28 February and I am sure he has now received the reports.  He will recognise that it represents excellent value for the Department of Education and that it is an ideal educational establishment.  I call on the Minister to approve the finance for this community college which is in a growth area for industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind remarks.  He will <Col N="1648" /> be aware that the Mercy Order which manages the school in Foynes have made known their intention of withdrawing from management of the Stella Maris Secondary School at the end of the academic year in 1991.  This school shares a catchment area with three other post-primary schools located in three different centres, namely Askeaton, Shanagolden and Pallaskenry.  Accordingly the possibilities for rationalisation of post-primary facilities are currently being examined by the Department.  A proposal has been submitted to the Department by the parents action committee in Foynes aimed at ensuring the continuance of the school under the aegis of County Limerick vocational education committee beyond 1995.  Last week the Minister met a deputation representing the local action committee in Dáil Éireann and he undertook to have the school buildings assessed by the professional staff of the Department's building unit.  They have now carried out the appropriate investigations and it is anticipated that their report will be submitted to the Minister for the end of this week.  The Minister will not be in a position to assess fully the proposals on the future use of the Stella Maris School until he has had the opportunity of examining the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for coming to the House and I wish him well in his new appointment. I want to raise the subject matter of Questions Nos. 149 and 150 of 19 February and particularly the reply I received to Question No. 150 which was totally inadequate. This concerns the School of Art and Design in Limerick which is one of the three constituent colleges of the Limerick School of Art, Commerce and Technology.  The School of Art and Design accommodates 400 students in five locations dispersed through the city at a rental outlay of over £100,000 per annum.  Apart from the cost involved, the task of administering a school over five different locations is extremely difficult and certainly not cost effective.  The educational deficit from this arrangement is more pronounced.  Student mobility and utilisation of resources are areas which suffer badly.  Notwithstanding this <Col N="1649" /> and other problems, the School of Art and Design is one of the leading art institutions in the Republic.</P>
      <P>I understand that a proposal has come from the representatives of the college asking that the possibility of a new college on the present main site, which was formerly St. Anne's Post-Primary School at George's Quay, together with houses between that and the former Barrington's Hospital and Barrington's Hospital itself, should be used for a new School of Art and Design.  The facade of Barrington's the height of the ceilings in the old wards and the very large windows are very suitable in terms of lighting and space for studios for painting, fashion design and sculpture.  Has an assessment been done of this proposal and will the Minister look on this favourably and give the go ahead?</P>
      <P>Iit is vitally important that the School of Art and Design remain down town in the city of Limerick.  The exigencies of an artistic education require a city location and I would strongly advise the Minister against re-siting the school in the suburbs on the proposed site for the Schools of Engineering, Building and Business which are being built on one campus.  Please keep the College of Art and Design in the city and look favourably on the proposal before the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The background is that the Department have agreed to the development of the Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology.  As a consequence the Department requested the City of Limerick vocational education committee for a feasibility study on the viability of having the entire School of Art and Design on the Georges Quay site.  The Department had also agreed to the preparation by the vocational education committee of a development control plan for Moylish.</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to the feasibility study of the Georges Quay site is that the Department will be in communication very shortly with the vocational education committee regarding the suitability and viability of the site for the entire School of Art and Design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> With regard to the development control plan for Moylish, a design team comprising a firm of architects, structural engineers, service engineer and quantity surveyors has been appointed by the City of Limerick vocational education committee in relation to the planning Phase 1 A extension which would be assisted by the European Regional Development Fund.  The fee arrangement for the design team is under consideration by the vocational education committee.  It is intended to have a contractor on site by August 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 10,000 students fail ordinary level mathematics each year in the leaving certificate.  Because there are three levels of mathematics in the new junior certificate, the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, ordered that a new ordinary alternative leaving certificate mathematics course be drawn up.  The Department of Education circular to schools in 1990 states that the course &ldquo;will be equal in standard to ordinary level leaving certificate mathematics.&rdquo; I have had the course evaluated by mathematics teachers and by objective analysts.</P>
      <P>The course is without question, at least equivalent in standard to the existing ordinary level leaving certificate maths with an acceptable and highly commendable different orientation.  Thousands of students were encouraged to embark on the course on the basis of underwritten departmental guarantees. Lo and behold, the nine RTC colleges and the six Dublin Dublin Institute of Technology colleges have refused point blank to accept the new mathematics course for entry to over 90 per cent of their courses.  Indeed, of the 210 courses, approximately, provided by these colleges, all require mathematics except 14 of the art related area.  The whole thing is a shambles and it is up to the Minister to intervene.  Children's livelihoods are at stake.  Courses for which they have opted on the basis of the bona fides of his predecessor's assurance: are now closed off from them for spurious reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's published position that it is up the the Dublin <Col N="1651" /> Institute of Technology and RTC colleges to decide on their own subject requirement.  I do not accept that the Minister must remain a hapless bystander while an injustice is done to thousands of students.  There is a hidden agenda here and I put it to the Minister that it is up to him to get to the root of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education instructed that this new mathematics course be set up.  It is a good course, it has a high standard, it is highly practical and perhaps more relevant than some of the elitist conceptual mathematics of some of the other courses.  I would ask the Minister to stand by the students who stood by his predecessor's assurances and who are now the victims of some interest squabble.  The Minister for Education is the education overseer.  More importantly, he is the paymaster and has ultimate power.  I am now asking him to get the to the bottom of this problem, to get the various parties around the table immediately and to resolve the problem once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The minimum entry requirements for individual courses into the RTC and Dublin Institute of Technology is a matter for the colleges concerned and the validating agency.  The Minister does not, therefore, have a direct function in that matter.  In line, however, with the general objective to standardise and streamline entry requirements the Minister is taking up with the institutions any anomalies arising between the institutions regarding entry requirements.</P>
      <P>The development of the alternative mathematics syllabus was in the context consideration of how best to cater at senior cycle for low achieving pupils who sat the intermediate certificate mathematics examination in 1990.  It was not intended that the syllabus would normally provide a basis for entry to third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position with regard to the alternative syllabus is that it is accepted for matriculation purposes or as satisfying the minimum entry requirement for admission to courses as appropriate.  It does not, however, satisfy the entry <Col N="1652" /> requirement for courses where mathematics is specifid as an essential subject for a particular course.  For this reason, the circular sent to the schools in 1990 announcing this new option advised pupils who intended to take the option and who intended to proceed to third level study, after the leaving certificate, to check the status of the syllabus in relation to admission to the institution of their choice and to the courses available therein.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for affording me the opportunity to raise the matter of accommodation at Confey College, Leixlip.  I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State to his new portfolio and to wish him well.  I hope that this evening he is the bearer of good tidings.</P>
      <P>Confey College in Leixlip caters for 402 students at present and only 25 per cent of that total are accommodated in permanent classroom accommodation. Since 1987, when the school was first started, most of the students have been accommodated in temporary or prefabricated structures.  The school, while much sought after and much appreciated in principle, has now come to a crucial crossroads where it is most important that the Minister and his Department make a decision, the effect of which will be the provision of permanent classrooms in the current year, or at least a large proportion of them.  If that is not done the present crop of students will have gone through their entire second level education in prefabricated structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present situation it is impossible to observe ordinary safety at work fire regulations or to carry out a proper fire drill in the cramped conditions that exist in the courtyard.  Access is gained through a building site which is not the best but it is not the fault of the Department or the Minister.  There are areas in which the Minister can assist: for example, he can assist the parents, teachers and students who have valiantly tried to maintain the very high standards <Col N="1653" /> which they have had over the years.  It is now the Minister's turn to respond positively and provide permanent classroom accommodation which is absolutely necessary if those children are to have the standard of education which we want for all our young people in order to give them a reasonable chance when they leave school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>

      <P>However, I will respond to both matters.  In the case of the planned permanent building, the Deputy will be aware that planning by County Kildare Vocational Education Committee's design team of the extension to replace existing temporary accommodation at Confey College is nearing completion.  The provision of this new permanent accommodation will be the solution to the long term accommodation problems at this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the construction of this new accommodation the school has been housed in temporary classrooms and a small permanent block of classrooms.  In regard to the planned accommodation, I should point out, both to the Deputy and the House, that every step has been taken to ensure that no undue delay has occurred recently in the planning of these facilities. Indeed, in this context my Department authorised the vocational education committee to allow their design team to combine some stages of planning in order to speed up the planning process while still <Col N="1654" /> maintaining the very necessary high standards of design and cost control.</P>
    <P>As a result of this commitment, the planning of the facilities is, as I have said, nearing completion although it is not yet possible to say when construction will commence.  However, every effort will be made with the resources available to include the project among those for which tenders may be sought in 1992.  My Department are not aware of the need for additional accommodation in excess of that currently being planned. However, the Department would be prepared to consider any proposals from the vocational education committee regarding any short term measures required to meet the school's immediate needs.  This issue can be adddresed should the school authorities and County Kildare Vocational Education Committee approach the Department.</P>

      <P>Cé go raibh deacrachtaí trádála áirithe ann ó am go chéile, lean an comhlacht ar aghaidh agus tá áit bainte amach aige sa mhargadh.  Tá tréaniarrachtaí déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta thar na blianta chun an fhostaíocht sa ghnó a chaomhnú agus leanfar leis na hiarrachtaí sin.</P>

Tá sé curtha in iúl do cheardchumann na n-oibrithe go mbeidh sé riachtanach an fhoireann oibre a laghdú ach go fóill ní raibh aon phlé sonrach faoin gceist.  Is cúis dhiomá dom go bhfuiltear ag smaoineamh ar an bhfoireann a laghdú.  Beidh an tÚdarás i gcomhairle leis an gcomhlacht agus leis na húinéirí nua chun iarracht a dhéanamh nach gcaillfí poist nó ar a laghad le cinntiú go gcoimeádfar líon na bpost a gcaillfear chomh híseal agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras ach go mbeidh deiseanna gnó ann do chomhlachtaí fiúntacha sa ghnó bia.  Tá sé de bhuntáiste ag Smailcbhia (Dún na nGall) Teo. go bhfuil táirgí maithe aige, le branda atá aitheanta sa mhargadh agus le soláthar bunábháir ar fáil sa chontae.  Ba mhaith liom gealltanas a thabhairt go ndéanfaidh mé féin agus Aire na Gaeltachta i gcomhar le Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an ardbhaínistíocht ansin ár ndícheall ionas nach mbeidh laghdú ar bith ar an fhoireann ansin.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil siad a rá go mb'fhéidir go dtarlódh sé, ach an t-aon ghealltanas gur féidir linne a thabhairt ná go mbeimid i dteagmháil go rialta leis an Údarás agus go mbeidh siadsan i dteagmháil leis an chomhlacht atá ann i láthar na huaire agus, ar ndóigh, leis an chomhlacht atá le teacht ina dhiaidh sin.  Déanfaimid ár seacht ndícheall chun a chinntiú nach mbeidh daoine ag cailliúint a gcuid post.</P>

      <Quest>if it is proposed to take any action at EC level to support the Community position in the GATT round to the effect that payments proposed under the Common Agricultural Policy reform to compensate farmers for price reduction would not be deemed to be subject to the discipline under GATT, in view of the critical importance of this matter for the Irish economy.</Quest>

      <P>The treatment of the compensatory payments proposed under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the GATT and indeed other direct payments is a matter of the <Col N="1496" /> utmost importance for Ireland.  My position, which I have forcefully expressed at every available opportunity and most recently at the Council this week, is that these payments must be in the &ldquo;green box&rdquo; of policies which will not be subject to discipline in the GATT.  It is essential that Community producers and economies can be compensated for income losses which may result from price reductions under Common Agricultural Policy reform and the outcome of the GATT.  This is a major point for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the Draft final Act put forward by the Director General of the GATT, these payments would fall into the category of policies to be disciplined.  This is a matter of very great concern to me and to many of my colleagues in the Council and the Commission has been made aware of my position as already expressed.  The Council's view on the paper is that it calls into question the foundation of the Community's agricultural policy and that it has to be modified. The Commission has been mandated to negotiate necessary improvements to the text.</P>
      <P>The treatment of the Common Agricultural Policy reform compensatory and other payments is one of the major deficiencies to be corrected.  The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. MacSharry fully shares my position on this issue and is on record as saying that there will be no GATT agreement unless this matter is resolved.</P>
      <P>When the Community's offer was drawn up in November 1990, Ireland secured clear commitments from the Council and Commission on the need for complementary measures aimed at the most vulnerable producers and economies. The proposed compensatory payments are an integral element of this undertaking.  The House can be assured that I intend to see to it that this commitment is honoured.</P>

      <P>With regard to the proposed distribution of intervention beef to low-income families, I am glad to state that tenders were issued and adjudicated on and canning is at present taking place. Distribution of the canned product is planned to commence 23 March 1992. This is a new departure to see if it is more appropriate to distribute the beef after processing rather than in the frozen state as has been done in the past.  This method is now adopted in most participating member states to overcome distribution difficulties.</P>
      <P>Before proceeding with the processing and canning operation, my Department was in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who as in previous years have agreed to undertake the onerous task of distributing the beef.  Since it is not possible to cover all social welfare recipients the decision has been made to restrict the scheme to the same categories to which it applied in the past.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The controls built into the system are necessary to detect errors in the batching of applications and in the punching of data for processing by computer.  Entire batches are only rejected when there are errors in batch totals.  An error in one application in a batch will not generally cause rejection of all the applications in the batch unless the particular error affects the batch totals.  In view of the high standard of controls required by the Comptroller and Auditor General and by EC Commission auditors and in the interest of protecting public moneys it would be unwise to drop the present controls.</P>
      <P>Initial problems in the processing of 1991 special beef premium applications have now been overcome and it is expected that the remaining cases will be processed without any complications.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>There is provision under the milk quota regulations for the restructuring of milk quotas at co-operative/dairy level. Such restructuring schemes, whereby producers sell their quotas to their own co-op/dairy for re-sale to other suppliers in the same co-op/dairy have been successfully operated for the past number of years.  No scheme was, however, announced for the current year as Ireland was obliged to operate an EC Community-funded buy-up scheme.  The percentage quota purchased under this buy-up scheme will be reallocated to all producers who suffered a quota reduction in the current year.  This scheme provides for the distribution of the purchased quota on a national basis and furthermore the legal view of the EC Commission is that member states may take action to limit buy-up in individual areas only where the scheme is oversubscribed nationally.  I am, however, considering how best to offset to some extent the imbalances between purchasing areas created by the way this scheme has worked out in practice.  I have also asked the milk quota review group to consider the approach to be taken to the problem of disproportionate losses in the event of future Community buy-up schemes.</P>

      <P>The EC co-financed operational programme for rural development contains a wide range of measures aimed at stimulating rural development.  These include farm diversification, such as sport horses and deer, horticulture, agri-tourism and forestry, farm relief services, small and community enterprises, research and development and marketing in the food industry and training in agriculture, forestry and fisheries.  Some £104 million of national and EC funding is available for this programme.</P>
      <P>The Leader programme is the EC's own initiative on rural development.  As already announced, 16 Irish groups are to receive national and EC aid totalling £35 million in support of their business plans.</P>
      <P>In addition, the new national structure for promoting rural developments is now being established.</P>
      <P>These initiatives represent the Government's current programme for integrated rural development including responses to all of the issues, such as population decline, mentioned by the Deputy.  They will operate to the end of 1993 and, depending on evaluation of their impact at that stage, long term policy on rural development will be determined.</P>

      <P>The EC regulations governing the special beef premium scheme specify that where the number of animals found at inspection is less than the number applied for no premium is payable unless the reduction is attributable to natural circumstances affecting the herd or <i>force majeure</i> and the reduction is notified to my Department within ten days, or unless the reduction is confined to one animal in herds of up to 40 animals and to less than 5 per cent in herds with between 41 and 90 animals.  In cases where the reduction is within the limits stated and there are no other irregularities in the claim premium may be paid on the remaining animals in the herd at 80 per cent of the normal rate provided there is no indication of fraud.</P>
      <P>In August 1991 the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, announced a concession under the special beef premium scheme which allowed farmers who wished to sell cattle before field or office inspection but after the minimum two months retention period to bring the cattle identity cards of the animals which they wished to sell to their local office of my Department for checking, stamping and punching.  This concession preserved entitlement to premium on the animals sold.</P>
      <P>Any farmer who disposed of cattle before inspection through financial pressure and who did not avail of the concession can be paid premium on his or her remaining animals only if the EC requirements to which I have already referred are met and then at the reduced rate of 80 per cent.</P>
      <P>The sale of animals through financial pressure is not seen by the EC as constituting disposal or loss through &ldquo;natural circumstances affecting the herd&rdquo; or through an acceptable <i>force majeure</i> reason.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that on 27 July and 25 September 1990 the person concerned, a United Kingdom taxpayer, completed customs and excise declaration forms, in accordance with the transfer of residence provisions, for the purpose of importing his personal effects into this country free of duty and/or value-added tax.  Following these declarations an inquiry form was issued by the inspector of taxes to him in order to determine his liability to income tax.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information furnished by this UK taxpayer, he was advised on 30 July 1991 that he was regarded for tax purposes as being a resident of this State and as such he was liable to tax in respect of his total income from all sources including the UK.  At no stage in his correspondence with the inspector did he claim to have only a &ldquo;holiday home&rdquo; in the State.  Liability to income tax for the years 1989-90 and 1990-91 has not yet been determined by the inspector as tax returns have not been filed to date.</P>

    <P>Sunday &amp; Public Holiday Overtime Double time.</P>
    <P>These rates apply in full to grades with salary maxima up to that of the executive office grade.  Those grades with salary maxima above that of executive officer and below that of higher executive officer must give the first hour free for Monday &mdash; Friday overtime, and the hourly rate for overtime is calculated by reference to the officer's actual salary or the 4th point of the HEO scale, whichever is lower.</P>
    <P>The grade of usher in the Houses of the Oireachtas is not encompassed by the standard overtime arrangements.  Instead ushers are paid an hourly gratuity in respect of extra attendance.  Staff in higher grades which are not covered by the standard overtime arrangements may be given time off in lieu in respect of extra attendance.</P>

    <P>All such pensions arise from service as officers, non-commissioned officers or privates with the Permanent Defence <Col N="1515" /> Forces in respect of periods of service ranging from 21 to 28 years and range from £2,647.67 to £11,414 per year.  The total annual sum currently paid in such pensions to civil servants in the Houses of the Oireachtas is £90,447.05.</P>
    <P>In the case of two of the ushers no gratuity was paid at the time of their discharge from the Defence Forces.  The gratuities based on the rates of pay applying <Col N="1516" /> in the Defence Forces at the time of discharge paid to persons now employed as civil servants in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas ranged from £1,058.82 to £9,765.62.  The amount paid amounted to £61,893.70.</P>
    <P>Four of the services officers in question did not commence employment until May 1991 and the weekly average gross earnings of the remaining staff for the tax years 1988-9, 1989-90 and 1990-1 were as follows:</P>

      <Quest>the reason the proposed decentralisation of the Revenue Commissioners to Nenagh in County Tipperary has been deferred from early April to a later date for the majority of the staff; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, (1) this delay is causing financial hardship, inconvenience and stress for the staff involved and (2) many staff are now paying for rented accommodation in both Dublin and Nenagh, while others are burdened by double mortgages, and furthermore others have made personal plans such as marriage arrangements on the understanding that they would be based in Nenagh from the first week of April; if there are any proposals to compensate staff involved; if he will outline the dates of moving for sections involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The latest information from the Office of Public Works is that the new building in Nenagh will not be fully fitted out until the end of May.  However, part of the accommodation is expected to be available earlier.  The Revenue Commissioners did not quote firm dates for the relocation of staff because the completion of new buildings is obviously a matter that cannot be precisely predicted. Every effort is nevertheless made to give as much advance notice as possible to staff and internal bulletins had provisionally indicated that the first moves to Nenagh should commence in the month of April 1992.  This was based on the latest information available to the commissioners at the time and it was always understood that April 1992 was by no means a firm date.  In the circumstances no question of compensation arises.</P>

      <Col N="1518" /> I am aware that some deer poaching has taken place in the areas in question and I can assure the Deputy that every possible effort is being made by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Office of Public Works, to stamp out this problem.</P>
    <P>Additional rangers were recently recruited and some of these are based in Counties Dublin and Wicklow where they will enforce the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976 regarding, <i>inter alia,</i> illegal hunting of deer.</P>
    <P>I have no evidence that the deer population in the Slievebloom has been decimated or is under threat.  In total, 669 licences to hunt deer during the 1991-92 open seasons were issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</P>
    <P>Hunting of all game species including deer is reviewed each year having regard to the conservation status of the species. If scientific evidence suggests that a particular game species is under threat it can be removed from the open seasons order made under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  This situation has not arisen in relation to deer.</P>

At the time of imposing sentence the court has available to it all information relating to the case, including the length of time the defendant may have spent on remand in custody.  In the case referred to by the Deputy the court, having considered all matters before it, imposed a sentence of seven years to take effect from 14 April 1988.

      <P>The policy with regard to the curbing and monitoring of drug abuse is contained in the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse which was published in May 1991. The National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse, under the chairmanship of Deputy Flood, Minister of State at the Department of Health, is concerned with the implementation of the various recommendations contained in the strategy which cover a number of Government Departments, notably Justice, Education, the Revenue Commissioners (Customs and Excise) and Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The committee will be making an informal interim report to the Government shortly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of needle exchange for drug abusers, this preventive approach has proved successful in a number of European centres, particularly in reducing the risk of spreading HIV infection.

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The gradual rise in cancer mortality over recent decades is a trend which has been experienced throughout the developed world.  During the last ten years in Ireland the increases have been largely confined to the older age group with rates for older women rising most rapidly.  The upward trend in cancer deaths has been offset by a parallel fall in mortality from diseases of the circulatory system as detailed in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 123 on 18 February 1992.</P>
      <P>Tobacco consumption is the major single cause of cancer mortality in Ireland.  In seeking to reduce the percentage of the population which smokes, the Department of Health pursue an integrated strategy of legislation, education and fiscal measures.  At a European level this country has always supported measures aimed at reducing the threat to public health from smoking.  The current EC directive, restricting advertising and specifying the size and type of health warnings to appear on packets is largely in line with Irish legislation.  We have also supported the recent Commission proposal to ban all advertising of tobacco products.  As the Deputy is aware smoking is prohibited in a range of public places and in designated facilities, for example schools and public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986 the European Community established a Europe against cancer programme with the aim of reducing deaths from cancer in the Community by 15 per cent by the year 2000.  The European <Col N="1528" /> Commission, in implementing the programme among member states, involves governmental and non-governmental organisations especially national cancer prevention bodies.  In the Irish context the programme is implemented through a national co-ordinating committee, a multi-sectoral group chaired by my Department's chief medical officer involving the health promotion unit of my Department, the Irish Cancer Society, health boards, Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Heart Foundation. The scientific nucleus of the programme is provided by an EC committee of cancer experts on which the Department are represented.  Under the programme, a wide range of prevention initiatives have been undertaken nationally on issues such as education/information on smoking, nutrition, screening, and the training of health professionals.  Such initiatives under the cancer programme are part funded by the EC.</P>
    <P>Important fiscal measures have been taken by the Government in recent years when it approved an increase of 10p per packet of 20 cigarettes in the 1991 budget and a further increase of 16p per packet in the 1992 budget.  The numbers who smoke are expected to reduce as a result of these increases.</P>
    <P>Anti-smoking advice from health professionals is also an effective medium for supporting current smokers.  The health promotion unit has recently developed a general practitioners/public health nurses anti-smoking pack.  It is aimed to assist such professionals in their work to advise their patients/clients who smoke, to give up.  Information booklets on &ldquo;Smoking and Health&rdquo; and &ldquo;So You Want to Stop Smoking&rdquo; are issued with an accompanying manual.  It is intended that this resource pack will also be made available to dentists during this year.</P>
    <P>A major element of my Department's anti-tobacco strategy is school based.  A range of programmes are in place.</P>
    <P>Primary and post-primary schools nationally are involved in a &ldquo;Health is Lookin Good&rdquo; competition which since its launch in 1990 has concentrated on <Col N="1529" /> health issues with a particular emphasis on tobacco.</P>
    <P>A complete range of health education classroom materials for use in primary schools will soon be available following their successful piloting in the functional area of the Mid-Western Health Board. The anti-smoking messages will of course be included in these materials.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit, the Irish Cancer Society and the Department of Education are developing, in conjunction with young people, a peer-led anti-smoking project called &ldquo;Smoking Cessation and Reduction Action Programme&rdquo; (SCRAP).  This programme will commence later this year with a training seminar for senior cycle students.  A total of 15 schools will be invited to attend.  Four students and one teacher will be chosen from each school, and participants will be chosen on the basis of their leadership qualities and facilitation abilities.  Following skills and leadership training, young people will return to school with the skills necessary to instruct their peers with regard to various aspects of their health-related behaviour and to initiate projects on this theme.</P>
    <P>The substance abuse prevention programme is a comprehensive drug education programme.  It is a joint Department of Health/Department of Education initiative.  The programme which commenced on a two-year pilot basis in eight second level schools in September 1991 will continue this year.  The overall aim of the programme is to enable students to develop their ability to take charge of their health and to make aware and informed decisions about the use of drugs, including tobacco in their lives.</P>
    <P>A healthy school project is being developed.  The overall aim of this project is to improve the health of the total school population, students, teachers, parents, school support staffs and those in the wider community.</P>
    <P>It will be jointly co-ordinated by the Departments of Health and Education and issues dealt with will include the development of personal skills, the creation of healthy school environments and the encouragement of healthy lifestyles <Col N="1530" /> and communication networks for all within the school community and its environment.  An anti-tobacco approach will be an important ingredient in this project.</P>
    <P>Early detection and treatment of cancer is of particular importance.  For example, cervical cancer is the cause of 60-80 avoidable deaths per annum.  The cervical cancer smear test is available to every woman.  In order to consider what further improvements can be made in the area of cervical screening I intend to reconvene the working group on cervical screening at an early date.</P>
    <P>A diagnostic mammography service is also available on a referral basis to women at a number of public hospitals throughout the country.  My Department are also supporting the Eccles breast screening programme currently underway at the Mater Foundation.  This programme is part of a network of pilot schemes on breast cancer screening underway within the European Community. The screening phase of the pilot study will be completed in 1994.  The study findings, including the uptake of the service by women in the target population, will be a major influence on any future decisions in relation to a national screening programme.</P>

These are currently under <Col N="1531" /> review with a view to reissuing them to take account in particular of changes in the compensation provisions introduced under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1990.  Planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála are obliged to have regard to the proper planning and development of an area, including the preservation and improvement of the amenities thereof, when considering planning applications and would in this context have to have regard to tree preservation orders where appropriate.  I have no proposals at present to amend the legislation relating to the standing of tree preservation orders.</P>

    <P>The above figures relate in respect of cattle and sheep to June of each year and in respect of pigs to August.</P>
    <P>The national beef herd has been increasing since 1989 but there is some evidence to suggest that numbers may now have peaked and that there will in fact be a slight reduction in the near future.</P>
    <P>Dairy cow numbers have been reducing over the last number of years in response mainly to milk quota cuts.</P>
    <P>Sheep numbers have increased dramatically over the last six years in response to relatively good returns from the enterprise.  These returns have been very much influenced by the EC support arrangements &mdash; ewe premium, headage payments &mdash; for the sector.  The increase in numbers in 1991 has slowed down considerably and the outlook for 1992 is that a further small increase will take place.</P>
    <P>Pig numbers have also been increasing <Col N="1533" /> since 1988 in response to improved market conditions and indications are that there may be a further increase during 1992.</P>

      <P>As part of its comprehensive package of measures to reform the Common Agricultural Policy presented on 29 October 1991, the EC Commission has proposed the introduction of a processing premium in respect of male dairy breed calves slaughtered before they are ten days old.  The amount of premium proposed is 100 ecu or £87.88 per calf. The Commission's justification for this scheme is to remove surplus animals from the market and to improve quality of production since milk breeds do not yield a product of desirable quality.  This proposal has been opposed by a number of delegations, including Ireland, on the grounds that it does not effectively deal with the current problems in the sector. The latest Presidency paper, circulated this week, provides for the acceptance of lightweight animals for intervention as an alternative to the slaughter premium.</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform debate is ongoing at EC level and these proposals are again being discussed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels this week.</P>

      <P>Prospects for exports of beef and cattle to the Middle East and North Africa are better this year than in 1991. The Iranian authorities agreed last November to re-open their market to Irish beef and commercial negotiations are underway.  On Libya, there has been a breakthrough on beef and I hope this will be followed later this year by an agreement on the resumption of cattle exports.  Exports of beef to other countries in the region such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia are proceeding steadily.</P>
      <P>The volume of exports will of course depend on commercial factors such as price and supplies on the international market and, in the case of Iraq the framework for trade set by the United Nations.</P>

      <P>In fulfilment of a Government commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> I have established a review group, representative of my Department and of the farm organisations which will examine all national policies relating to the agriculture and food sector and which will draw up a development programme.  This programme will have to take account of any conclusions emerging from Common Agricultural Policy reform and GATT negotiations, as to do otherwise would be unrealistic, but I cannot at this point predict what shape the development programme will take.</P>
      <P>Employment in the food and agriculture sector, currently representing 18.7 per cent of total employment, has been undergoing an overall downward trend over recent years.  While the numbers which declare themselves to be farmers in census and labour force surveys has consistently fallen, there has been a significant shift to part time farming and this trend is likely to continue.  I will avail of every opportunity to create and sustain jobs in the food and agriculture sector.</P>

      <Quest>if he will re-examine the request of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 7 for supplementary welfare to augment his £36 per week strike pay during the four weeks RTE dispute for a family of five persons which was already refused on the basis that the family could apply for a credit union loan.</Quest>

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme the determination of applications for assistance is a matter for each health board.</P>
      <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board, who are responsible for administration of the scheme in the Dublin area, that the application from the person concerned was refused on the grounds of means.  However, having reviewed the matter, the board have now established that the person in question has an entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance and the board have undertaken to contact him with a view to making the appropriate payment.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the annual financial implications of providing a free telephone rental allowance and a free electricity allowance to widows/widowers under 66 years of age who are living alone and whose spouse prior to bereavement was eligible for these allowances, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain differences in the conditions for entitlement to a free telephone rental allowance and a free electricity allowance.  In order to qualify for a free electricity allowance, a person must be living alone, or living only with a dependent spouse, an invalid, or a full-time carer.  To qualify for free telephone rental allowance, a person must be living alone, or living only with children under 15 years of age, or living with people who are so permanently incapacitated that they could not get help in an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice, therefore, a married couple is not entitled to a free telephone rental allowance unless one of them is so permanently incapacitated as to be <Col N="1539" /> unable to summon help in an emergency. In the event of the death of the claimant, the surviving spouse will normally qualify for either allowance in his or her own right provided they themselves are over 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a precise cost of extending the present arrangements to surviving spouses under 66 years of age but a rough estimate would be of the order of £4 million.</P>
