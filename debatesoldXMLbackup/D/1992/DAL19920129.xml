      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2 and 10, No. 2 to be adjourned not later than 2.30 p.m.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House that: (1) The motion for the general Financial Resolution shall be moved not later than 12 midnight whereupon business shall be interrupted and the Dáil shall adjourn forthwith; (2) The sitting shall not be suspended today at 1.30 p.m.; (3) Following the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance and the statements of the spokespersons for the parties in Opposition, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes and (4) there will be no Private Members' Business today.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the <Col N="2" /> motion for the general Financial Resolution which shall be moved not later than 12 midnight whereupon business will be interrupted is agreed?  Agreed.  In respect of No. 2, that the sitting shall not be suspended today at 1.30 p.m. is that agreed?  Agreed.  In regard to No. 3, following the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance and the statements of the spokespersons for the parties in Opposition, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes, is that agreed?  Agreed. Finally, is it agreed that there will be no Private Members' Business today? Agreed.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach in view of reported statements by the Progressive Democrats and, indeed, by other Ministers, if he can confirm whether the joint <Col N="3" /> programme agreed between his party and the Progressive Democrats remains in place, and, further, may I ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to ask the Ceann Comhairle if he would not agree that the programme of legislation for this House is set out in that joint programme and, therefore, questions about the continued applicability of the joint programme are relevant to the programme of legislation and, therefore, relevant at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to remind the House again, as I have done so many times, that the matters which can be raised on the Order of Business are such as the business of the day, the taking of other business on the Order Paper, the taking of business which has been promised which, therefore, can be anticipated, arrangements for sittings and when Bills and other documents needed in the House will be circulated.  Unless the House wants to change this procedure the Chair has no option but to conform to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must accept your ruling, reluctantly.  May I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware of the provisions of Article 28.11 of the Constitution which deem that if a Taoiseach resigns all other Ministers shall resign also?  Can the Taoiseach ensure that any period of political uncertainty arising from recent reported statements by Ministers and any actions he may wish to take himself will be kept to an absolute minimum so that the <Col N="4" /> House and the country can get back to work at the earliest opportunity?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would indicate if he is going to see the inside of Aras an Uachtaráin himself shortly?  Surely the Taoiseach must feel it incumbent on him, understanding his obligations as I know he does full well under Article 28 of the Constitution, to make a statement clarifying the exact position of the Government.  This is a very important day in Irish politics when the budget is being introduced by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach should make it clear in relation to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed considerable latitude on this matter but, <Col N="5" /> strictly speaking, it is not relevant now. Deputies will find other ways and means of raising this issue.  It does not arise on the Order of Business now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise it is extremely important that the Taoiseach clarifies the situation and also, perhaps, makes time available to this House because on a previous occasion when the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, then a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, had a problem in Government he resigned from Government.  Why is the situation so different now?  Does the Taoiseach have the confidence of Minister O'Malley and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I want to raise; the first relates to the fact that the Taoiseach, theoretically at least, is still in charge of the Government and I assume the Minister for Foreign Affairs is still in charge of matters relating to Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland policy.  May I ask the Taoiseach therefore if he intends to make a statement to the House regarding the comments by the Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Kennedy, who has called for a &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; policy in relation to Northern Ireland which is seriously in breach of the stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa, the Chair is on his feet and will be heard.  I was stating that there are <Col N="6" /> many questions on today's Order Paper relating to Northern Ireland and it might be more appropriate to raise the matter then.</P>

      <P>May I raise two matters? First may I raise a matter which I have raised here on budget day each year for a number of years and a precedent was set by your predecessor, Deputy O'Connell?  Now that the budget debate will be broadcast live, may I ask the Taoiseach or the Chair to ensure that all Members get a copy of the Minister's statement simultaneously and that it is not given to some Members of the House only?  In this day and age all Members are equally trustworthy, and I would ask that that be done.  Second, with regard to the long promised imminent legislation dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose powers date back to 1866, can we please have that Bill?</P>

      <P>Mar Aire na Mara táim freagrach as slándáil bheatha ar mhuir agus mar sin is chúis áthais dom an Bille seo a mholadh don Dáil.  Creidim gur chéim mhór chun tosaigh é chun slándáil a fheabhsú ar uiscí faoi réimeas na hÉireann.  Ó ghlac mé dualgais Aire na Mara orm féin tá mé ag brú go dian chun reacht a rith d'fhonn smacht níos fearr a bheith ar shlándáil soithigh phaisinéirí chun laghdú ar uimhir na dtimpistí truamhéalacha agus ar an sléacht ar mhuir, ar aibhneacha agus ar locha.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to achieve these aims by updating existing legislation and introducing further safety measures in relation to vessel safety so as to reflect modern realities.  Specifically the Bill will: bring the licensing of vessels carrying not more than 12 passengers for reward within the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts for the first time; update the level of penalties for offences under existing legislation for vessels carrying more than 12 passengers; and enable me to make regulations governing the safety of fishing vessels and pleasure craft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially, I propose to give a short background to the Bill.  The Merchant Shipping Acts, which are administered by my Department, apply to vessels which carry more than 12 passengers to sea, or on rivers, canals, lakes or estuaries.  Such vessels are required to hold a valid passenger certificate and are subject to annual surveys conducted by the marine surveyors of my Department.  These Acts, and rules and regulations made thereunder, lay down detailed requirements in respect of safety on board such vessels. Vessels may be inspected at any time by marine surveyors of my Department. Sixty vessels now hold valid passenger certificates, many of the certificates being valid for the summer months only and for vessel operation in smooth or partially smooth waters.  Improved liaison with the Garda and the institution of proceedings <Col N="16" /> against illegal operators have reduced reported cases of overloading.  Publicity campaigns advising persons wishing to take trips on vessels to check that such vessels hold valid passenger certificates and comply with the requirements of those certificates have also served to reduce reported irregularities.  The major remaining difficulty is the low level of fines being imposed by the courts on the owners or masters of vessels operating illegally which does not prove an adequate financial deterrent to the illegal operator.</P>
    <P>Vessels which carry 12 passengers or fewer are outside the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts but may be licensed by local authorities under the Public Health Acts.  Boatmen's licences may also be issued by local authorities under the same legislation.  However, there are no statutory requirements laying down safety standards for these vessels and, therefore, there are no criteria by which local authorities can assess applications for licences.  The token level of fees and fines under the Public Health Acts and the discretionary nature of the licensing powers have resulted in the legislation being less than effective &mdash; and moribund in the case of many local authorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the larger passenger ferries, a review of the safety aspects of ferry transport has been ongoing since 1987 when my predecessor, the present Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Brendan Daly established the National Ferry Safety Committee.  The committee is chaired by my Department's chief surveyor and includes representatives from Irish ferry companies.  The committee review safety procedures and standards on board Irish registered ferries, consider any measures necessary to improve safety and makes recommendations, as appropriate, to the ferry operators and to myself.  Non-Irish registered ferries calling to Irish ports are subject to periodic inspections carried out in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control to which Ireland is a contracting party.</P>
    <P>A recent Royal National Lifeboat <Col N="17" /> Institution report indicates that the greatest number of accidents around the Irish coast last year were in the pleasure craft and commercial fishing categories. Hence the need for improved safety precautions in these sectors.  In the pleasure craft sector my attention has also been drawn to the hazards posed by jet-skis. Their operators are encroaching on waters used extensively by bathers and children in small craft.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a consolidation and improvement of passenger safety legislation and I believe that the establishment of the Department of the Marine in March 1987 provided a much needed impetus for this development. Prior to the setting up of the Department there has not existed since the foundation of the State a co-ordinated Government policy directed towards the development of marine resources or their protection. This is partly historical but to a large extent reflects the insufficiently high priority accorded to the development of the entire marine resource.  With a fragmented administrative structure it is not surprising that the result was a certain lack of focus and of a cohesive approach, with wasteful demarcation overlaps between Government Departments and agencies and unsatisfactory deployment of financial and manpower resources.</P>
    <P>With the establishment of the new Department, the administration of all the major sectors of marine industry were brought under a single head and the administration restructured to ensure maximum efficiency.  At this remove I think it is true to say that the giving of responsibility for marine affairs to a single Minister has proved a success and met with the approval of marine related industry and the seafaring community.</P>
    <P>The use of our seas and coastal waters for boating, sailing and other leisure activities is a source of great joy.  We need to develop facilities for pleasure craft, including marinas, if Ireland is to attract its fair share of sailing visitors from overseas and market itself as a centre for major ocean races.  However, it saddens me to see the extent to which tragedies occur because of failure to take <Col N="18" /> basic safety precautions.  The unpredictability of Irish weather and the vast power of the sea itself make seafaring hazardous, despite advances in vessel design.</P>
    <P>As part of their strategy in creating an awareness or consciousness of the importance of safety on our waters, my Department are engaged in the dissemination of information by way of press releases to the media, marine notices, booklets and pamphlets on particular aspects of safety.  I have copies of these with me.  While I am extremely pleased with the enhanced public awareness generated by campaigns already undertaken, the enhancement of the law in this area is fundamentally more necessary if lives are to be saved.  In this connection, the Bill will allow me to make regulations governing the safety of pleasure craft covering, for example, the carriage of life-saving, radio and navigation equipment.  The expansion of the Irish fishing industry in recent years has been described as spectacular, and I would not be inclined to disagree with this assessment.  While commercial fishing can be a profitable activity it can also be a very hazardous occupation.  We should never forget that when we take into account the very substantial increase in exports and the improvement in our GDP and GNP which has been brought about by fishermen who are engaged in this very hazardous occupation.  My Department have been involved in preparing educational material relating to the safety and operation of fishing vessels. In Howth some time ago I presented a very important booklet on this matter to the representatives of fishermen. However, as in the case of pleasure craft, I believe that the law in this area needs to be enhanced to ensure as far as possible the protection of the crews of fishing vessels.  This Bill will enable me to make regulations governing the safety of fishing vessels and their crews.</P>
    <P>The State's commitment to the rescue of persons in distress at sea has been considerably boosted in the past year. Following upon the Government's <Col N="19" /> acceptance of most of the recommendations of the Doherty report on Air-Sea Rescue Services a new marine emergency service was established within my Department last May.  The service &mdash; Slánú, the Irish Marine Emergency Service &mdash; has assumed responsibility for the operational aspects of maritime safety, rescue, shipwreck and sea and coastal pollution.  A director and chief of operations have been recruited and arrangements are currently in progress for the integration into the service of the coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head, the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon and the cliff and coast rescue stations throughout the country. The Marine Pollution Response Team, to whom I have paid tribute in this House for their handling of recent marine incidents where there was a threat of pollution, also come under the aegis of Slánú.</P>
    <P>In July 1991 an interim medium range search and rescue helicopter commenced operations out of Shannon on a 24-hour basis.  Earlier this month that helicopter was replaced by one specifically equipped to carry out rescues in conditions of very poor visibility.  With effect from last July the Air Corps Dauphin helicopter which had been located at Shannon has been transferred to Finner Camp, County Donegal on a 24-hour response basis.</P>
    <P>The Doherty report also recommended the setting up of a Maritime Safety Consultative Committee and working groups covering safety on fishing vessels, pleasure craft and other vessel types to come under the aegis of the committee.  The main objective of the committee and their working groups is to keep me aware at all times of the concerns of the maritime community.  The membership of the four working groups currently being set up, that is in addition to the National Ferry Safety Committee of which I spoke earlier, comprises maritime industry and interest group representatives.</P>
    <P>The role of each working group is to review safety procedures and standards on Irish vessels in its sector; to consider measures necessary to improve safety in <Col N="20" /> these areas and to make recommendations to the Maritime Safety Consultative Committee; to consider legislative or other proposals, e.g., non-statutory codes of practice to improve standards or conditions in the sector; to consider safety matters referred to the working group by the Minister or his officials for observations; to consider complaints, proposals for improvement, etc., made by interest groups or other persons operating in the sector and, where appropriate, to submit them to the Maritime Safety Consultative Committee and to submit an annual report to the committee.</P>
    <P>The fishing vessel and pleasure craft working groups will be paying particular attention to the Bill before the House and will advise me, on an ongoing basis, through the Maritime Safety Consultative Committee of the measures to be regulated.  This accounts for the Bill providing me with enabling powers to make regulations in relation to fishing vessels and pleasure craft.  It is hoped to hold the preliminary meetings of the fishing vessel and pleasure craft working groups within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I should mention in passing that my Department continue to be exercised by the dangers posed by submarine movements in the fishing grounds around our coast.  At my direction, my Department's chief surveyor at a recent meeting of the International Maritime Organisation's General Assembly proposed a resolution on the avoidance by submerged submarines of fishing vessels and their crews. The purpose of the resolution, which was passed unanimously, is twofold: first, to ensure that submarines navigating through areas where vessels are known to fish, use all available means for determining the presence of such vessels and their fishing gear and second, to ensure that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its fishing gear is available, will avoid that fishing vessel and any fishing gear connected with it.</P>
    <P>The International Maritime Organisation are asking their members to bring these recommendations to the attention <Col N="21" /> of submarine commanders and to develop local arrangements to promote safety in areas used by submarines and fishing vessels.  I consider that getting this resolution through the General Assembly had very much a plus for this country.  By raising this issue at the highest level in the International Maritime Organisation my intention is to focus the attention of the international maritime community on the problem and to stress the need for constant vigilance if a major tragedy is to be avoided.</P>
    <P>I should now like to say a few words about the principal provisions of the Bill. Part I deals with the standard provisions of a Bill.  Part II deals with vessels carrying more than 12 passengers &mdash; they are the vessels for which legislation is in existence &mdash; and which are defined as &ldquo;passenger ships&rdquo;.  Section 6 provides that passengers ships shall be surveyed at least once each year.  Section 7 provides that this survey shall be carried out by a duly appointed surveyor of ships, and also by a radio surveyor if the ship is required to be provided with a radiotelegraph or radiotelephone installation, who shall provide the owner of the vessel with a declaration of survey, if satisfied that it is in order it do so.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the Minister for the Marine, on receipt of the declaration of survey shall issue a passenger ship's certificate to the owner, stating the limits, if any, beyond which the vessel shall not ply and the maximum number of passengers that the vessel shall carry.  The certificate shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Minister may impose.  A certificate shall remain in force for a maximum period of one year. The Minister may refuse to grant a certificate where the owner has been previously convicted of a safety-related offence.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the Minister for the Marine may revoke a certificate in cases where there has been an error in th declaration of survey, where false or misleading information has been given or where the condition of the vessel has changed since its survey.  The Minister <Col N="22" /> may revoke or suspend a certificate if its terms have not been complied with.</P>
    <P>Section 10 requires the passenger certificate, or a copy thereof, to be displayed in a position in the vessel so that it is both visible and legible to all on board.  Section 11 provides that a person shall not make a false or fraudulent declaration of survey or certificate nor alter such declaration or certificate.  Section 12 provides that a vessel shall not operate as a passenger ship unless there is a certificate in force in relation to that vessel.  Section 13 provides that a vessel shall not operate as a passenge ship without insurance and that the owner shall provide a copy of the certificate of insurance to the Minister for the Marine.  The certificate of insurance, or a copy thereof, shall also be clearly displayed on the vessel.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with vessels carrying not more than 12 passengers for reward &mdash; as the House has been told, this is an area which was not covered by adequate legislation &mdash; and defined as &ldquo;passenger boats&rdquo;.  Section 14 provides that a vessel shall not be used as a passenger boat unless there is a licence in force in relation to that vessel.  Section 15 provides that the Minister for the Marine, on the application of the owner of a vessel, shall grant a passenger boat licence to the owner if an authorised person has inspected the boat not more than two months prior to date of the application and has furnished a report to the Minister of the boat's suitability.  The licence shall contain requirements as to the limits, if any, beyond which the vessel shall not ply and the maximum number of persons that the vessel is fit to carry. This is necessary because a number of people, including Members, indicated to me that small boats carry too many people out to islands.  The licence shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Minister may impose.  The licence shall remain in force for a maximum of two years.  The Minister may refuse to grant a licence where the owner has been previously convicted of a safety-related offence.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that the Minister for the Marine may revoke a licence in <Col N="23" /> cases where there has been an error in the report of inspection of the vessel, where false or misleading information has been given, or where the condition of the vessel has changed since its inspection. The Minister may revoke or suspend a licence if its terms have not been complied with.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that the master of a passenger boat must produce for inspection by an authorised officer, his licence and-or proof of the boat's compliance with regulations, if any, with regard to insurance cover.  This section also requires that the owner's name, licence serial number and maximum number of passengers licensed for carriage be painted on the outside of the vessel above the waterline.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that the Minister for the Marine may make regulations to ensure the safety of passenger boats, their passengers and crews.  The regulations may cover seaworthiness; construction and maintenance of vessel; life-saving, fire-fighting, radio and navigation equipment; insurance cover; crew competence and such other matters including the charging of fees as the Minister consides necessary or expedient.  Different provisions may be made in the regulations for different classes of passenger boats.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains miscellaneous provisions, the most important of which I wish to mention.  Section 19 provides that the Minister for the Marine may make regulations to ensure the safety of fishing vessels and their crews.  The regulations may cover seaworthiness; construction and maintenance of vessel; life-saving, fire-fighting, radio and navigation equipment; periodic survey, crew competence and such other matters including the charging of fees as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.  Different provisions may be made in the regulations for different classes of fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that the Minister for the Marine may make regulations to ensure the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants.  The regulations may cover seaworthiness; construction and <Col N="24" /> maintenance of vessel; life-saving, fire-fighting, radio and navigation equipment; periodic survey; and such other matters including the charging of fees as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.  Different provisions may be made in the regulations for different classes of pleasure craft.  Contravention of the provisions of the regulations constitutes an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that where a master of, or a seaman employed in an Irish-registered vessel or on any vessel while it is in Irish territorial waters engages in conduct which endangers his vessel or any other vessel, structure, equipment, or any person he shall be guilty of an offence.  Likewise if his actions are proved to amount to neglect of duty due to being under the influence of alcohol or any drug he shall be guilty of an offence.  Section 24 provides that the master of a vessel the subject of a certificate or licence may refuse to permit on board a person under the influence of alcohol or any other drug.  The section also provides that it shall be an offence for a member of a vessel's crew to be on duty under the influence of alcohol or any other drug to such an extent that his ability to discharge his duties is impaired. Section 25 provides that an authorised officer may board or stop a vessel, inspect and examine such vessel and documents or records thereon.  A person who obstructs an authorised officer in the exercise of his functions shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 27 amends the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947, to provide for the recognition, by order of the Minister for the Marine, of maritime qualifications granted by foreign governments, where the Minister is satisfied that these are adequate qualifications for service on Irish-registered vessels.  Section 29 provides that the owner of a vessel who applies to the Minister for the Marine for a licence or certificate shall furnish the Minister with such information as he may reasonably require for the purpose of his functions under the Bill, when enacted. A person who furnishes false or misleading information shall be guilty of an <Col N="25" /> offence and the Minister may refuse to issue a certificate or grant a licence. Section 30 provides for the payment of fees by the owners of vessels for survey, inspection and the issue of certificate or grant of a licence.</P>
    <P>Failure to meet the requirements of the Bill, when enacted, or of regulations made thereunder constitutes an offence. The Bill provides for a range of penalties for offences depending on their gravity. Penalties range from a fine not exceeding £200 on summary conviction for failure to produce a passenger boat licence to an authorised officer to a fine not exceeding £50,000 &mdash; I may have another look at that &mdash; and/or up to two years imprisonment for failure or refusal to comply with a requirement specified in a passenger certificate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, in the preparation of this Bill, my Department have been in touch with a variety of concerned organisations. The National Safety Council see the Bill as complementing their efforts to promote water safety.  Bord Fáilte in seeking to attract tourists to this country place special emphasis on our relatively unpolluted waters and our water-based leisure activities.  On a personal note, I sold the idea of holidaying in Ireland to some visitors from Wurzburg, a city established by St. Killian from my constituency, and which is the capital of Franconia &mdash; Deputy Barnes will know what I am talking about.  They visited some islands off the coast.  I made arrangements to meet them after their holiday to find out if they had any complaints. When I asked how many passengers were on board the boat taking them to the island, I was told 12, which is exactly the limit for small passenger boats that do not require a licence.  The visitors were alert to what was happening and one made sure to count the numbers boarding the vessel because she was conscious of her own safety.  Incidently, the pluses far outnumbered the minuses.  For them safety is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide a statutory basis for safety codes of practice for the different water-based activities.  It will enable recommendations along the lines made <Col N="26" /> by the west coast search and rescue and action committee in their report, for example the introduction of annual safety equipment surveys for all Irish-registered fishing vessels and the fitting of emergency position-indicating radio beacons in all commercial seagoing vessels and pleasure craft above a certain size, to be given statutory backing.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill, by improving safety standards on passenger vessels and enabling me to introduce regulatory measures for other vessels, will go a long way towards preventing tragedies in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé ar dtús, is minic a bhí brionglóid agam ó tháinig mé isteach sa Roinn seo go mbeadh timpist ag baint le báid bheaga agus nach mbeidh aon dlí againn chun deileáil leis an timpist. Molaim go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair, agus tá mé cinnte go rachaidh sé chun sochair don tír iomlán.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members welcome this Bill.  It is a good omen that such positive legislation is being introduced at the beginning of this session.  I hope the good that will flow from this Bill will be reflected in the other legislation that will be introduced this session.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given us a broad ouline of the position at present and how the Bill will improve it.  We are all aware of the incredible risks that are taken continuously by vessels whose operators have chosen to ignore the regulations and hope to get by on a wing and a prayer. As the Minister pointed out, only when a dreadful tragedy occurs do we realise the dangers of our waterways.  We should never take them for granted.  The Bill lays down safety standards and the criteria that must be followed by all passenger vessels.  This is to be commended. As an island country we have a glorious opportunity of expanding water-based tourist activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that the merchant shipping Acts apply to vessels carrying more than 12 passengers.  This Bill legislates for vessels carrying 12 or fewer passengers on our rivers, canals, lakes and estuaries, as well as at sea. <Col N="27" /> I wish to highlight the canals.  While a tremendous amount has been done for water-based activities on our rivers and lakes, the Minister will agree that our canals offer a tremendous oportunity to see the neglected parts of our countryside. I would like to see greater investment by the relevant Departments in opening up the canals to navigation.  If the canals were linked, this would be a wonderful way of expanding the choice of waterways for visitors.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that marine surveyors from the Department will carry out annual surveys of vessels.  There will be tremendous pressure on staff if, as we hope, there is an increase in the number of passenger and fishing vessels.  I hope the Minister will guarantee that he will provide additional staff if they are required.  We are all aware that monitoring and enforcement are the most important aspects of legislation.  It is dangerous to undermine legislation by the failure to monitor and enforce it.  We would also like to see adequate training for staff.  I note that at present 60 vessels hold valid passenger certificates.  I expected there would be more and this leads me to worry that some vessels may be carrying passengers without the required certificate.  I note that many certificates are valid for the summer months only and for vessels operating in smooth or partially smooth waters.  Should vessels operate in an extended summer season and/or outside smooth waters, I hope the necessary requirement will be built into the legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the Department on their publicity campaigns. I know the Minister will agree that a huge amount of advertising and publicity is needed to raise awareness.  A once-off attempt, or even two or three attempts, at advertising will not impinge on people's consciousness.  Perhaps the Minister could let us know whether there are plans for an intensive publicity campaign to raise awareness of the implications and consequences of this legislation.  It is to be hoped that such <Col N="28" /> advertising would not consist merely of public notices at waterways and places of embarkation but would include national advertising.  I believe the greatest monitoring, the greatest moral and legal enforcement of the provisions of the legislation would come through an aware public, people who would do their own counting and their own reporting back. It is also important that people realise the legislation ensures there is no obligation on them &mdash; indeed, there is every obligation on the person offering the service &mdash; to take any risk whatsoever with regard to travelling on water, either to islands off Ireland or within the country. An effective advertising campaign and effective enforcement of the legislation will be of tremendous importance. Again, I ask the Minister to say whether he and his staff have planned such an advertising campaign.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us valuable information in relation to the larger passenger ferries and the review of safety aspects of ferry transport that has been ongoing since 1987, when the Minister's predecessor established the National Ferry Safety Committee.  The review will come as a matter of some relief.  However, it is essential that the committee and back-up services for the committee receive investment so that they are available to meet fully the demands placed on them.  I was reminded of the necessity for the committee last night when watching a news programme which referred to the tragic ferry disaster at Zeebrugge some three or four years ago.  Committees for the monitoring of standards were set up as a result of that tragedy and, naturally, they received the co-operation of everyone. However, a monitoring review committee, have learned that even though safety procedures on ferries were built in statutorily after that tragedy and even though the required technology was there, at times when ships entered and departed from ports members of a ship's crew were not available to monitor the findings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw that programme myself last night, it was amazing.</P>

    <Col N="29" />
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  It struck me that no matter how much legislation is put in place and no matter how well committees work and carry out reviews, unless and until it is ensured that new procedures are carried through by the operating crews themselves there could be a recurrence of another desperate and dreadful tragedy. Once again I point out that it is important, once the Bill is enacted, to concentrate on measures designed to seek the full co-operation of the public in the enforcement of the legislation and to make sure that the crews and everyone involved in aiding and assisting passengers on leisure craft and crews on fishing craft are fully trained and will carry out their obligations fully and not take short cuts that could lead to tragedy.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister and his staff whether there is in place some procedure to monitor and, if necessary, to enforce the obligations and responsibilities placed on a crew.  What discipline can be enforced upon them?  Is it written into legislation that when a crew are discovered to be in breach of passenger safety standards then their employer or captain can and will take action to ensure that the crew act fully in accordance with the regulations and their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that for as long as the administration and the regulations covering marine safety, regulations, training and so on had a fragmented administrative structure there was a lack of focus, a lack of cohesion, an overlapping between the agencies and an unsatisfactory deployment of financial and manpower resources.  I am sure we all welcome the fact that with the establishment of the Department of the Marine and with the ever-increasing expertise and experience of staff in that Department not alone will we see a tremendous improvement in all areas of legislation and safety for which the Minister's Department are responsible but also &mdash; and I know that the Minister will make this point very well with regard to the budget &mdash; that all available resources will be used in the most efficient way.  If savings are made to allow the Department as a whole to operate much more <Col N="30" /> efficiently and effectively, then the money saved on one level should be invested in the total needs and structures of the Department rather than being taken away from the Department.  That is a very forceful argument the Minister could put forward, and I am sure will put forward.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Minister made reference to two tragedies that occurred in the hazardous occupation of commercial fishing about which we are all concerned. One matter was the need for a comprehensive air-sea rescue service that would competently and comprehensively cover all areas &mdash; east, west and south. In that regard, the recent handling of the pollution response team in response to potential pollution was very welcome. However, some other tragedies, particularly the recent collision and the fate of the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> in Dublin Bay, were matters of great concern.  The incident of the collision remains of concern to us all until the report is finalised and published. I take this opportunity to again ask the Minister to publish that report.  The findings of the review of that incident, as in the case of reviews and reports on other disasters, are so important that the report must be debated fully and openly and the necessary recommendation adopted.  We all look forward to the issue of the report and to a public debate on it as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Another problem to which the Minister referred which makes fishing an extremely hazardous occupation, is submerged submarines.  There have been many traumatic incidents and accidents involving Irish fishermen and the tragic deaths of the Scottish fishermen recently. A Scottish report on that incident was produced and I compliment the Minister, and the Department, on bringing it up at the highest level in the International Maritime Organisation.  The Minister should attempt to strengthen the recommendation in the Scottish report so that fishing grounds will be off limits for submarines. There is enough water in the world for submarines to engage in exercises other than in fishing grounds. Unless the Minister ensures that fishing <Col N="31" /> grounds are off limits to submarines the submarine captains will continue to claim that they did not realise that fishing was taking place in the area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say if the IMO will monitor this problem?  Will the IMO make regular reports to the Minister and staff with regard to it?  We would like an up-date on that.</P>
    <P>I am glad fishing vessels will be covered by the safety and training regulations.  I read a report by Mr. A.O. Gannon, the Chief Executive of BIM in May 1991 about the problems of the Irish fishing industry and one of the issues highlighted in it was that fishing vessels are weather dependent and that the working conditions of deck crew can be dangerous. The report suggested the installation of shelter decks on vessels would provide safer and better working conditions for the crew.  However, such a solution would add tonnage to the vessel and would have to be compensated for by withdrawing a similar amount of tonnage in the catch.  There is much frustration with regard to tonnage and what fishermen have to cope with.  While shelter decks are a safety feature they do not improve the vessel for fishing purposes and are an added headache for fishermen. Will the Department look into that problem?  There should be some flexibility in relation to tonnage, licences and so on to encourage the provision of shelter decks which are a desirable feature.</P>
    <P>I applaud the introduction of legislation to allow the master or crew of any vessel to deal with passengers or crew members under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  It is very important that the crew and master of a vessel should have the right to refuse entry to people under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  When we think of the implications of the problems for other passengers this is a very welcome provision.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill will provide a statutory basis for safety codes of practice for the different water-based activities. Many Deputies are aware of the overlapping demands with regard to water <Col N="32" /> leisure activities, such as water skiing, surfing and swimming.  One of the problems with regard to water sports is that there has not been enough direction on designating areas off limits to other water sports.  Under the Bill certain areas may be designated for different water activities so that they will not be a danger, for instance, to swimmers and children.  The code of practice is urgent.</P>
    <P>We support the Bill although we may wish it to be tightened up a little on Committee Stage.  With the Minister we will have another look at the fines and penalties under the Bill.  There is no timescale with regard to the implementation of its provisions.  Has the Minister any idea of the timescale necessary to impress on those involved the implications of the Bill?  Will the provisions be phased in?  I recognise the dangers of doing that as far as safety is concerned but I wonder will people involved in water leisure activities, or those who wish to become involved, be aware of the implications of the legislation so that they can make improvements where necessary.</P>
    <P>In a cry from the heart I tell the Minister we must be concerned about the safety of passengers and crews on boats and we must ensure that piers and embarkation and disembarkation points are in good condition.  I use this debate to remind the Minister and his staff and the Minister for Finance of the huge investment needed to keep our piers safe and to restore them following recent storm damage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the commitment of the Minister and his staff to it.  I look forward to the Bill's enactment and enforcement as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, particularly the proposal to bring the licensing of vessels carrying fewer than 12 passengers under the Merchant Shipping Acts.  I also support the intention to update legislation.  The Minister and his Department must be commended for attempting to do this in a practical way. There is a need to update many Acts and make them more relevant in this decade and in the next century.  Some of the <Col N="33" /> legislation governing maritime affairs needs to be streamlined and modernised to cater for the rapid development of modern marine activity.  It is also necessary to protect the lives of people who travel by sea, river or lake.  Travel in small boats is to be brought within the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts for the first time.  This will be a step forward.</P>
      <P>There has been increasing interest in marine recreation and various bodies, including the Department of the Marine, have stressed the need for precautions and safety measures.  Despite this, lives have unfortunately been lost at sea and in rivers.  It is important that regulations be introduced and enforced to protect the public to the greatest possible extent. This legislation is therefore welcomed by my party.  We recognise that with the advancement of technology people have more leisure time and there is a greater emphasis on recreation.  There is a need to examine legislation and regulations governing such activity.  This has been neglected for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safety at sea requires constant review because by their nature the seas around the coasts are entirely unpredictable. Those who earn their living by harvesting our fishing grounds know the dangers and uncertainties which are part of their job and their way of life.  I pay tribute to all those who actively participate in the saving of lives at sea, those fishermen who respond to a Mayday call for help from their colleagues, no matter what nationality, sometimes at great risk to themselves.  I pay tribute too the lifeboat crews around the coast who, often in atrocious conditions, will carry out their voluntary duty in attempting to save lives at sea.  As recently as last week the Ballycotton boat was at sea for 16 hours.  We should put it on the record of this House that their efforts are recognised.  The Air Corps rescue service have an excellent record in saving lives.  It is opportune to mention the RAF rescue teams who have on numerous occasions made the perilous trip from Wales to participate in rescue missions off our coast in stormy conditions. Despite the downgrading of the base in Wales, rescue operations are to <Col N="34" /> continue for the foreseeable future.  Co-operation between the Air Corps and the RAF in regard to rescue missions has been excellent.  The development of our own rescue services augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>I also commend the inshore rescue services, beach lifeguards, the Garda subaqua club, the fire brigades and many more who are involved in all aspects of marine activity.  All those services will react to emergencies at sea.  This Bill would appear to be an attempt to prevent accidents and protect those using the sea. It will be mandatory to implement certain regulations so that the general public will have proper protection when using such facilities.  I have no quarrel with that, but I would ask the Minister to clarify certain points.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out as its main purpose, in the interests of safety of life, to bring the licensing of vessels carrying not more than 12 persons within the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts for the first time. I wholeheartedly welcome this provision. Ferries ply to and fro across the Lee at the Marina in Cork, particularly on the day of a big match or some other major event.  Where boats are handled by experienced boatmen and there is no overloading this is quite a legitimate means of travel, but very often unscrupulous individuals will overload and take a risk in crossing this fairly wide expanse of water.  If someone were to panic in an overloaded boat there could be a disaster. I have watched this development over a number of years and it is frightening to see the number who will take the risk of travelling in overloaded boats in order to save themselves an extra mile. Boats have frequently been overloaded. There could be great danger if a person were under the influence of alcohol or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a dangerous practice and I welcome anything to control it.  Up to now the law has been vague about who should control such activity on the river and the fines which could be <Col N="35" /> imposed were no deterrent.  I am sure this type of offence has been happening throughout the country and the risk to life has been great.  Any measure to curtail such activity is to be welcomed.  The absence of criteria for assessing applications for suitability is a glaring inadequacy in the current legislation.  I hope the Minister will state the means he proposes to introduce to assess an applicant.</P>
      <P>In Part II the Minister lays down regulations governing passenger ships, that is ships carrying more than 12 passengers. These regulations go some way to ensuring that the safety and seaworthiness of the craft is of paramount importance.  I hope this aspect of the Bill is not a pious aspiration.  We have seen in the wake of the Zeebrugge disaster that certain ferries at present in operation do not comply with stability requirements.</P>
      <P>While the provisions of this Bill are targeted mainly at the small operators we must ensure that companies operating ferry services to and from Britain and the Continent comply with the regulations laid down adhering to Irish and international standards.  It is a matter of serious concern that in a recent survey published by the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> it was discovered that ferry companies operating from Irish ports lagged far behind their British and French competitors in the provision of up-to-date life saving equipment.  In that survey also attention was drawn to the fact that life rafts aboard Irish Ferries and B &amp; I passenger car ferries met the minimum national and international legal standards, their design being outdated.  It should be mandatory on all passenger ferries plying between Britain and the Continent to have fitted on board aircraft-type escape chutes which would allow passengers a speedy escape from a vessel in danger at sea. While the main emphasis of the provisions of this Bill is on small craft, pleasure and fishing boats, it is important to point out that ferries operating from this country be scrutinised to ensure that the best life saving equipment and ship design are deployed in the interests of passenger safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> I should like to refer now to pleasure craft.  I am disappointed with that part of the Bill dealing with them.  I would have expected that the Minister would have gone much further than he has in this Bill.  There is an ever growing interest in marine recreation leading to a substantial increase in the usage and ownership of small boats.  While it must be said the vast majority of boat owners are responsible people, with a great love for the sea and our rivers, treating them with considerable respect, there is need for some type of registration system to be devised whereby boat owners who use their craft strictly for pleasure purposes, not for profit, can be identified if such need occurs.  I might point out that I can purchase a cabin cruiser for my private use and deploy it without any restraint in our waters; I do not even need to be competent to do so.  I can manoeuvre it in busy off-shore waters where there may be hundreds of people swimming.  Indeed I could cause somebody serious injury. Yet, in such circumstances, it would appear there is no way in which I can be identified except through the name of the vessel which can be easily removed. While recognising that the provisions of this Bill are aimed at controlling vessels with a capacity for fewer than 12 people there is a need to legislate for boat owners, yachts and privately-owned craft using our waters on a regular basis.  I contend there should be some criteria laid down ensuring that people's competence to use such boats in crowded waterways is clearly ascertained and examined.  While recognising that such proposal may meet some resistance it must be said that there is a lacuna in the legislation in that such people can take out such vessels while being totally incompetent to do so.  This is something that should be seriously examined.  I am not advocating merely a register of people owning boats but rather one drawn up so that people who use such boats be responsible to some authority for their usage and the activities in which they engage in inshore waters and off our beaches.  With the growing popularity of yachting marinas and interest in boating <Col N="37" /> there is need to examine all aspects of safety measures governing the usage of our waters.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that the Minister referred also to the growing interest in jet or water skis which have become popular at various seaside resorts and on many of our lakes.  While I do not wish in any way to curtail this increasingly popular sport I must point out that if such jet skis are used in crowded areas they can cause serious accident.  Any legislative provisions governing safety should embrace all aspects of water activity, particularly those where the public are involved.  I am sure the Minister has had representations from many people who use our lakes where such jet skis are being used.  In fairness, it must be said they have been a cause of annoyance to many people particularly fishermen, when they find these water skis zooming in on top of them.  As I am sure the Minister is aware, this has led to much friction.  It may well be the reason for his referring to the matter in the course of his introductory remarks.</P>
    <P>Examination of all these aspects and proposals will be of fundamental importance in the future.  It is indeed opportune to legislate for such activities now ensuring that the public and boat owners are fully and adequately protected.</P>
    <P>I have already paid tribute to the various organisations who engage in the dangerous task of rescue services at sea. It is only proper that those people using boats for pleasure and/or recreational purposes, and indeed for fishing, do not endanger others who may have to come to their rescue and assistance.  If such people engage in these activities and endanger others through their incompetence, ignorance or inexperience then a heavy responsibility rests on their shoulders.  The proposals I have made constitute a reasonable request without in any way curbing the freedom of the individual wishing to participate in marine activity.</P>
    <P>There is need for the introduction of guidelines governing the usage of speed boats, cruisers or water skis in shallow water off our beaches which may <Col N="38" /> endanger bathers or others using those waters for recreation purposes and indeed for fishing.  While those aspects of recreation may not come within the scope of the provisions of this Bill I would have to ask why not, since this Bill purports to have people's safety as its primary objective?  Perhaps the Minister would consider broadening its provisions ensuring that all related aquatic usage or activity is governed by them, incorporating the points to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that the Minister may make regulations to ensure the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants covering seaworthiness, construction and maintenance of vessels, life-saving, fire-fighting, radio and navigation equipment and so on.  Does that mean there will be some control over all types of pleasure craft since it would appear that the provisions of section 20 (6) do not cover owner usage of a pleasure craft I should like that point clarified.  While not wishing to dwell on the question of a private owner of a vessel and his or her responsibility, very often the search for and rescue of pleasure craft which have strayed beyond their limitations places others at risk.  Bearing in mind that the lighthouses around our coasts are becoming fully automated we must remember that this will lead to the absence of the hitherto vigilant eyes of those lighthouse keepers.  In turn surely this will lead to greater need for protection of those who use their craft for pleasure purposes?  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me when I say that the loss of lighthouse keepers is a very high price to pay for progress&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean this seriously, since such lighthouse keepers have had an enormous tradition of service to sea-farers handed down from generation to generation.  Their absence will be greatly noted and their services sadly missed by all those who go down to the <Col N="39" /> sea in ships.  I must pay tribute to lighthouse keepers who have given such sterling service to boat users, sometimes inexperienced, who venture too far. Indeed it must be recognised that very often such keepers, particularly on our southern and eastern coasts, have kept an ever vigilant watch for people they know, from experience, are or may get into trouble at sea and have saved many a life.  Their human touch will be sadly missed by all.  It is indeed a high price to pay for automation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision dealing with the safety of fishing vessels and their crews.  One must admire the tenacity and endurance of such crews who very often must confront adverse weather elements in order to harvest the seas around our coast.  Very often such crewing skill is an inherited one acquired the hard way by practical experience.  Section 19 states that the Minister may require fishing vessels to comply with specific standards of seaworthiness and also with specific standards of construction and maintenance. I would ask the Minister to indicate how he proposes to deal with this particular aspect of the Bill taking into consideration the age and condition of some of our fishing fleet.  Will it mean that boats which no longer meet these requirements will be prevented from fishing or will the Minister have a time frame for the modernising and the improvement of these crafts?  The Minister will appreciate that we are recognised as having one of the oldest fishing fleets in Europe if not further afield.  It would be a source of worry to a number of people who are trying to operate boats out of the various fishing harbours and who may not have the necessary finance or the resources to enable them to improve their boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 19 (5) provides that the skipper of a fishing vessel is equally responsible and guilty of an offence as the owner if there is a contravention of a regulation under the section.  I would have grave reservations regarding an employee being as guilty as the employer.  The Minister should examine this point again <Col N="40" /> even though I recognise that the skipper has responsibility for the vessel at sea.</P>
    <P>I welcome any measure that will bring crewmen on board our trawlers under the protection of the law.  For far too long these seamen have faced unbelievable conditions in trying to make a living. Their colleagues in the United States, Britain, USSR, Japan, Canada, Norway, France, Holland, Poland and even Peru and many other countries enjoyed protection under the international labour legislation but Irish fishermen had no protection.  I certainly welcome any measures to be introduced by the Minister to address this situation.</P>
    <P>At present there is no requirement for safety measures for the smaller commercial fishing craft except for a few basic rules governing life belts.  I am speaking about craft under 40 feet in length and there are now apparently over 2,500 of these at present in existence.  There are no regulations governing launches, speed boats, motor cruisers and yachts which use our waters.  Also there are no competency certificates for boat owners, unlike on the continent where a competency certificate is needed.  There should be some method for examining a person's ability to handle their craft in an emergency.  I compliment those organisations and clubs who voluntarily give lessons and training in the handling of boats and yachts and who carefully monitor progress of novice seafarers.  The fact remains that there are at present no statutory regulations governing sea-going small craft, and I would ask the Minister to examine closely this area of his responsibility.</P>
    <P>Some of the points raised and some of the proposals may be resisted for various reasons.  People may have bona fide reasons for not going along with them but I believe it is vitally important that every person using the seas, rivers, lakes or estuaries should be obliged to recognise certain safety standards.  It must always be remembered that for everyone who goes to sea, inexperienced or careless, and gets into difficulty there have to be others who will risk their own lives to save them.  That is the point I made at <Col N="41" /> the beginning of my contribution.  Very often when people get into difficulty at sea other people in various organisations lose their lives in the fight to save them. The point I am trying to emphasise is that anyone who takes a boat out a certain distance should have at least the basic training in handling a boat.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that the Minister is ultimately responsible for any legislation before this House, I request that before Committee Stage consultation takes place with organisations who have a keen interest in this very important matter of safety at sea.  I am aware that the Department have been in touch with the appropriate organisations, but I would ask the Minister to seek the views of such organisations as the RNLI, the IFO, the Irish Yacht Association, harbour authorities and local authorities before legislation is finally passed so that all these groups could advise and have some input into legislation which will probably be on the Statute Book for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the legislation before us but I would like to have the points outlined above clarified, some of which may need to be amended.  For far too long we in this country have accepted the fact that people had a right to do what they pleased when going to sea.  At the same time if we are to be a responsible maritime nation we should look at the example of others and see what other nations have done in respect of their commercial and pleasure boats, cabin cruisers, yachts and so forth.  It is part and parcel of our lifestyle to take it easy.  For years many fishermen in small open boats have gone many miles out to sea perhaps without even a life jacket, which is frightening. Frequently many lives have been lost.  If the files of the Department of the Marine were opened, perhaps we could learn lessons from previous incidents involving loss of life.  Perhaps some of the legislation is based on those incidents. nevertheless, the IFO, the RNLI and other such organisations should be consulted because they have first hand experience, they understand the sea and what faces people who wish to cater for <Col N="42" /> marine recreation activities which are now a big attraction in this country.  As Deputy Barnes said, we can provide attractive facilities for tourists, but unless we have the necessary legislation in place and can enforce it, we are only wasting our time.  I welcome the legislation proposed by the Minister and before he concludes perhaps he will clarify some of the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the first matter that the Dáil has come to consider after the recess is a measure which commands such a wide degree of agreement following such an exciting month in the political life of the country. Perhaps it is a case for Dáil recesses being shorter in future and the Members of the Dáil getting back to normal legislative business which might take Members' attention off other matters.  I do not propose to break the consensus that is emerging on this legislation which I warmly welcome.  It is legislation I have been seeking for some time and which I have raised on Question Time on a number of occasions, the necessity to extend the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act to vessels carrying fewer than 12 passengers.  As Deputy Barnes has mentioned, this is a matter of public concern in a maritime constituency where there are many small boats and pleasure craft in the area.</P>
      <P>Some time ago Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, of which I am a member, wrote to the Minister for the Marine asking that a change be made to the legislation to incorporate safety measures for small craft.  For those reasons I am very glad that this legislation is before us and I am quite anxious that the Bill pass through the Dáil as quickly as possible. Bearing in mind the pressures on parliamentary time I do not propose to make a long speech on this measure.  I hope this will facilitate the Minister in concluding Second Stage today, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This essentially is enabling legislation and provides for the making of regulations covering fishing vessels and pleasure craft.  I know this argument has been made here often in relation to <Col N="43" /> enabling legislation but it is a pity that the headings of the regulations have not been spelled out in greater detail in the primary legislation.  The difficulty is that the regulations themselves, which will deal with matters such as life jackets, evacuation procedures and the standard and design of vessels, will not be debated in this House.  That is a pity.  It would be far better if we had before us the draft regulations proposed here.  I say this because I am anxious that, if at all possible, the legislation be enacted and in place, along with the regulations, for the coming summer season.  This is desirable having regard to the concerns which have been expressed here in relation to improving safety on water.</P>
    <P>I am a little apprehensive about the Minister's statement on how he proposes to proceed in making regulations.  He mentioned that he will have the matter considered by the Maritime Safety Consultative Committee and that preliminary meetings would be held with the fishing vessel and pleasure craft working groups and so on.  I hope I am not reading too much into that but it seems to suggest there may be a delay in introducing regulations once the legislation has been passed.  I would be concerned if any such delay would mean that the coming summer season would be missed.  While it is a matter of regret that the details of the regulations have not been included in the Bill and they have not been circulated I would emphasise the need, once the Bill has been passed, to introduce the regulations as quickly as possible so that the brionglóid which the Minister talked about earlier will not cause him to have any more sleepless nights and that an accident, which understandably would be a matter of concern for him, will not happen before the regulations are put in place.</P>
    <P>There is a number of matters that I want to refer to, some of which have been touched upon.  Deputy O'Sullivan touched on the problems associated with the larger passenger vessels, in particular the ferries which serve this country.  He pointed out correctly that this legislation <Col N="44" /> deals mainly with small boats.  It does however, quite clearly, define &ldquo;passenger ship&rdquo; and is intended to cover the larger vessels as well, including I presume the various car ferries which serve this country. In this regard there is an issue which needs to be addressed.  I am aware that when I raised this matter at Question Time on a couple of occasions I was criticised for scaremongering.  I do not wish to be alarmist but there have been reports during the past two years in relation to the standards of safety which apply on ferries serving this country and those reports are disturbing.  Reference has already been made to the tragedy involving the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> at Zeebrugge. Let us hope that we will never have to cope with such a tragedy in this country, involving any ferry serving this country, but the point has been made before that once the channel tunnel opens we will be the last sealocked member state of the European Community.</P>
    <P>We are heavily dependent on sea transport to transport goods and people to and from this country.  Car ferries are now very large and carry large numbers of passengers and the potential for a tragedy involving a car ferry, particularly on the Irish Sea, is quite worrying.  Reference was made earlier to the problems associated with submarines.  The Minister of State confirmed here on a previous occasion that there is a danger that a submarine will collide or engage a passenger vessel.  That would be a very serious matter indeed.  Therefore we will have to look closely at the question of safety on ferries.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about two reports which have appeared in the recent past. The first appeared in the French consumer magazine <i>Que Choisir</i> and it dealt with Irish Ferries.  It rated Irish Ferries at the bottom of a list of 33 international ferry companies in relation to safety and the capacity to evacuate passengers.  It stated that the survey, which compared the percentage of passengers which can be evacuated using a specified evacuation system, found that the <i>St. Killian</i> and the <i>St. Patrick</i>, both owned by Irish Ferries, <Col N="45" /> could evacuate just 43 per cent and 38 per cent of their passengers respectively. That is an extremely disturbing report. When I raised the matter here at Question Time on 20 June last I was told by the Minister that the article concerned had been passed to the ferry company for their comments and that the report would be discussed at a meeting of the National Ferry Safety Committee.  Perhaps the Minister when he comes to reply will let us know what conclusions the National Ferry Safety Committee arrived at in relation to that report and what the observations of the ferry company were. The public are entitled to feel secure with regard to car ferries.</P>
    <P>Another disturbing report appeared in the British consumer magazine, <i>Choice.</i> It dealt mainly with six ferry operators, including the B &amp; I, the Cork-Swansea operation and the Isle of Man operation which service this country.  It dealt with the methods of evacuation and pointed out, for example, that on some of these vessels passengers would be left with little alternative but to take &ldquo;a hair-raising climb to safety on rope ladders&rdquo; should anything occur.  It pointed out the desirability of moving to the dry shod method of evacuation.  Although, apparently, there are no regulations &mdash; or legislation &mdash; which requires 100 per cent dry shod evacuation, the international maritime organisations and the United Nations have identified the dry shod method as the safest way of getting people off a vessel which is in difficulty.</P>
    <P>Those areas need particular attention, first because of the importance for the passengers concerned but also because of the potential damage which could be done to our tourist industry if the consumer magazines in France and Britain, the biggest source of tourism to this country, state that there is some doubt about the safety of car ferries and methods of evacuation.  It is an extremely serious matter which must be dealt with and I should like to know, since I raised the question here last June, what consideration has been given to it and what measures have been taken to improve the <Col N="46" /> level of safety and to assure the travelling public, in this country and abroad, that the ferries operating to and from this country are quite safe.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that measures are being taken here to introduce regulations for safety in relation to commercial fishing vessels.  Deputy Barnes mentioned this already; I think it was at the Torremolinos Convention it was pointed out that a fisherman is twice as likely to die at work as a similar worker on land.  We have had a number of tragic examples where doubt has been raised about the levels of safety which apply on commercial fishing vessels.  Up to now there has been no legislation governing safety on fishing vessels; they are not covered by the existing Merchant Shipping Act or by the safety at work legislation covering employees in land based work.</P>
    <P>We also have a very poor record of safety on fishing vessels.  After one of the tragedies a couple of years ago, the president of the Irish Master Mariners' Association stated: &ldquo;I have the greatest admiration for the bravery of fishermen but I would criticise the use of inexperienced, unqualified people taking out some of these boats.&rdquo;  He went on to talk about the problems of safety on fishing vessels.  I am glad that it is proposed in this legislation to introduce regulations to cover fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>After a tragedy an inquiry is always established and there have now been a number of Department of the Marine inquiries into tragedies involving fishing vessels.  I do not recall any of them producing a published report and it is time, in the context of the debate on this Bill, for the Minister to release reports of tragedies so that, while considering this legislation relevant to it, we will be able to see what conclusions were reached by the inquiries.  I do not accept the argument, advanced in this House previously, that these inquiries are confidential, that their findings should not be made public or that it would be unfair on the bereaved relatives of people who lost their lives.  I am sure that the bereaved relatives would be anxious to know what happened and <Col N="47" /> to hear the conclusions reached.  The reports should be published.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister in his speech referred to the problem associated with submarines in the Irish Sea.  I commend him and his Department for having put forward the resolution at the International Maritime Organisation's general assembly, the effect of which, as I see it, is to caution submarines about their operation and avoiding fishing vessels. Of course the question which must be raised here, particularly in the context of the Irish Sea, is why we should have such a degree of submarine activity in the first place.  This country does not have submarines, the Cold War is now over and whatever justification might have been put forward for submarines playing war games under the Irish Sea and Russian, American and British submarines chasing each other &mdash; a justification I never accepted &mdash; there is now no justification for it.  We should be seeking, through the International Maritime Organisation, a requirement that no submarine would operate under the Irish Sea; if submarines have occasion to travel through the Irish Sea they should do so on the surface because of their potential danger. There have been cases where fishing nets became entangled and trawlers were dragged for a considerable length.  We must also bear in mind a recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme by Mr. Pat Butler which showed quite clearly that, in addition to the number of submarines which operate in the Irish Sea, there is also a problem relating to the command of those submarines.  Former commanders of submarines were interviewed and they talked about the dangers of the submarine commander, isolated under the water for prolonged periods, the degree of disorientation which occurs and the potential there is for, quite literally, a commander to go slightly over the top and to do something rash.  We must bear in mind that these submarines are for the most part nuclear powered and the potential danger is enormous.  We should be flexing our muscles somewhat more in <Col N="48" /> saying that we do not want any submarines operating under the Irish Sea.  If they have occasion to travel to and from Holy Loch they should be required to travel on the surface.  I mentioned earlier the need for the results of inquiries to be published, in particular the results of inquiries into tragedies involving fishermen. There is now an inquiry being conducted into the collision involving the <i>mv Kilkenny</i> and perhaps this would be a good time for the Minister to bring us up-to-date in relation to it.  He should let us know when we can expect a conclusion because a number of questions have been raised in relation to the collision.  Why did it happen?  What exactly happened? Why did it take so long, for example, to make contact with the Dún Laoghaire lifeboat?  I understand that there was a gap of about one hour.  There has been much speculation about what happened in relation to that collision and we should have the results of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make relates to enforcement.  It is one thing to have legislation on the Statute Book &mdash; I am glad that this legislation has been brought forward &mdash; but attention will have to be given to its enforcement.  There have been difficulties in enforcing the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act.  I have with me a press cutting from the summer of 1989 which relates mainly to incidents which occurred off the Kerry coast.  It quotes a Department of the Marine spokesman as saying that it was difficult to catch boatmen in the act as manpower was thinly stretched and walkie-talkie radios were being used to avoid Garda patrols.  While I am glad we are putting legislation in place I would be somewhat concerned if the necessary resources were not also put in place to enable the legislation to be enforced. There is no point in having legislation which is not enforced.  Some attention will have to be given to this point.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy O'Sullivan, and the other speakers, in paying tribute to the people who risk their lives to save people at sea and, in particular, the lifeboat institute who carry out very admirable work.  On an <Col N="49" /> occasion when we are dealing with the issue of safety at sea it is appropriate that we pay tribute to those who risk their lives and devote so much of their time to helping people in distress at sea and trying to save the lives of others.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Bill is before us and I compliment the Minister on bringing it forward.  While there are some points of detail on which I will seek amendment on Committee Stage we should give this Bill as quick a passage as possible through this House and encourage the Minister to introduce regulations and have them in place for the coming season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for the welcome they have given the Bill and for the detailed examination they made of it. This was obvious from the points <i>seriatim</i> which were made by the Deputies in their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Barnes for highlighting the importance of the canals in connection with the development of tourism and pleasure boating.  It is important that we should be able to guarantee the safety of our tourists when using our rivers, lakes, canals and the sea on the invitation of Bord Fáilte and people in the tourist industry.  Deputies Barnes and Gilmore said there would be pressure on staff.  I wish to tell the House that a programme of recruitment is in place at present to carry out all the functions of the marine survey office of my Department. Deputies who are sharp of eye will have seen advertisements in the newspapers recently.  Applications are being processed at present by the Civil Service Commission.  Deputy Barnes referred to the three month licences and asked about an extension of them.  A three month licence is issued simply to cover the period requested by those who operate for the three months of the summer. From my time in the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, I know that Bord Fáilte were stressing an extension during the two shoulder periods, spring and autumn, and no doubt we will be able to accommodate any such <Col N="50" /> development so far as licences are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes referred to the necessity for national advertising.  I would agree with what the Daputy said up to a point. I mentioned that we have had a very bright, successful and informative publishing exercise with regard to safety which will take account of all that is necessary.  I fully agree with the Deputy about the importance of an aware public. I could not help observing that there was no journalist in the press gallery at the time the Deputy was speaking.  They might have been able to help us a little in terms of free advertising of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I saw the programme on television last night on the <i>Zeebrugge</i> disaster to which the Deputy referred.  The point made was that despite the fact that the apparatus was on board the ferry, which was examined and monitored by people to see whether the <i>Zeebrugge</i> recommendations were being put into effect, there was nobody watching it.  Apparently there was nothing wrong with the procedure &mdash; the bow had been properly closed off and so on.  However, as the person who carried out the examination pointed out, despite the fact that the apparatus was there and someone was supposed to be watching it, there was noone there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the accident involving the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i>, as the House knows this is adequately covered by legislation. Reference was made by Deputy Barnes, and the other two Deputies, to the report.  The House can rest assured that no effort will be spared in establishing the cause of the accident which led to this tragic loss of life.  The main purpose of the preliminary inquiry was to find out what went wrong and to prevent such accidents happening in the future.  There has been an established procedure with regard to reports on such matters for such time.  I am studying ways to change the procedure, subject to any legal constraints there may be, so that the maximum amount of information will be made available to the House and the families concerned.  We want to establish <Col N="51" /> what went wrong and see to it that it does not happen in the future.</P>
    <P>All the Deputies referred to the incidents involving submarines.  The first of those happenings took place in the Irish Sea a few years ago.  Deputy Gilmore stole my lines in this regard when he said, the worldwide power play has changed. I agree with Deputy Gilmore that there is not the same concern with regard to the plying of submarines, one superpower watching the other, in the Irish Sea and along the north east of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, there was a very important base in Scotland and a good deal of the traffic into and out of that base and of submarines watching the goings on in an out of that base is, thankfully, no longer necessary because of developments towards world peace.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also welcomed the provisions with regard to drink and drugs.  I have seen a hazardous incident in that regard on one of our waterways comparatively recently, and we are absolutely convinced that it is necessary to include this measure in the legislation.  The Deputy mentioned the IMO and the resolution we got through at the last General Assembly.  The result of that will be careful monitoring, initiated, as far as we are concerned, by my Department, with the IMO.  There will be no undue delay in bringing in the legislation and, as I have mentioned already, provision is being made for the recruitment of surveyors.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan rightly spoke about our location and the unpredictability of the seas around our coast.  I am sure the House would agree that the south, southwest and west where the Atlantic asserts itself so frequently, apart from being one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, is also the place of greatest hazard.  We all know of major damage to ships which was coped with adequately in that area.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy O'Sullivan and other Deputies who paid tribute to the fishermen who, as a result of Mayday calls, go to the aid of ships and sailors in distress.  I am speaking of the help given by fishermen, lifeboats, the Air Corps and particularly, as Deputy O'Sullivan <Col N="52" /> mentioned, the Royal Air Force from Wales who have helped over the years.  I take this opportunity of endorsing the Deputy's remarks.  Their help is very much appreciated at departmental and Government level.  I would also point out to the House that we are now in a position to reciprocate somewhat because of the putting in place of Slánú.</P>
    <P>The Deputy emphasised his welcome for the law applying to the 12 and under passenger boats.  He instanced the River Lee in Cork where huge crowds use boats and the danger of such boats being overloaded. Last Monday we got a conviction in the courts for illegal traffic on the River Lee, and the Deputy will probably read of that in the paper before very long.  Our legislation will cover that whole area.  If the advertising and the national information service are adequate, the people who use and own those boats will know exactly what are their obligations under the law.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said he is worried about the quality of the liferafts on ferries.  We ensure that the international obligations are fully met by the ferries.  There are problems with ferries that are not up-to-date. However, what we regard as very important is that the international regulations should be adhered to and, through the various committees I have mentioned, we will see to it that that is so. There is a problem with regard to pleasure craft, the different sizes of pleasure craft and jet-skiing, and these matters will be covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of enabling regulations was raised by Deputy Gilmore and others.  There is an established practice for dealing with enabling legislation which will give Members of this House an opportunity to take action if they feel that is necessary.  There will be no delay with regard to the legislation.  Deputy Gilmore mentioned the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> collision.  I assure the House, the companies involved and the unfortunate families of the three men who were lost, that information will be made available, subject to all legal structures, as quickly and as fully as possible.  At present my <Col N="53" /> Department officials and I are considering a change in that system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the matter of consumer magazine surveys.  I have already made the point that the Irish ferries meet the IMO requirements in full.  We are happy with that, and we are assiduous in seeing that that is so.  Older ferries, of course, cannot be put off the seas and cannot be modified to take the up-to-date equipment, but we must satisfy the IMO requirements and we do so.  The NFSC have taken into consideration the reports referred to by Deputy Gilmore and we are satisfied with the Irish standards in this area.  The enabling measures I mentioned already will be introduced by way of statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, it is important that all the interest groups be consulted so that if they have suggestions to make we may be able to take cognisance of them in making the regulations.  We have already had wide and varied consultations when the Bill was being drawn up and I am sure that on Committee and other Stages, we will also be able to get insights which will be helpful.  I have already given an assurance that there will be no unnecessary delays in introducing the measures.</P>
    <P>I have outlined what has happened with regard to the founding of Slánú &mdash; the Irish Marine Emergency Service &mdash; and I think the House appreciates, and the Members who took part in the debate showed their appreciation of this major development in safety for life at sea. There has been a very serious level of investment in helicopters.  As I mentioned in my opening speech, the director and chief of operations have been recruited and are working in the new service.</P>

      <P>The potential for developing Community action in cultural matters pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty will be discussed at the Cultural Affairs Committee and later at the Council of Ministers of Culture.  The EC Commission have already been preparing guidelines for cultural action in the years 1992-96 as a basis for discussing an expanded cultural programme in the context of the new Treaty.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Community action will supplement rather than replace action by member states.  Our concern in the forthcoming discussions will be to see increased resources allocated to important areas such as training in the cultural sector &mdash; in conservation, arts administration and in audiovisual technology; to development of the schemes for translation especially for lesser-used languages; to support for our heritage conservation efforts; to more active interchange between our arts organisations and arts organisations throughout the Community; to more active policies for access by the public to culture; and to measures which would stimulate increased private funding by the private sector.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs will be involved in exploring these possibilities in the context of the Community discussions to give effect to the Maastricht Treaty provisions.</P>

I visualise for instance that we could secure great assistance in regard to the promotion of the Irish language and culture.  In all these areas we will be, and are already promoting the idea of funding for the implementation of this cultural policy. These are matters, of course, which will be considered and dealt with in the forthcoming financial prospectus being prepared by the Commission.  These financial prospectuses may well be the subject of a summit meeting before they are finally put into effect.</P>

It is infinitely better that it should be part of the Community's ongoing development than otherwise.  There is no doubt that the Community will certainly have regard to the already existing role of the Council of Europe in all these areas.  We all know the Council of Europe pre-dates the European Community and therefore has a great deal of knowledge and experience in this whole area.  It would certainly be our view &mdash; and I am sure the view will be similar throughout the Community &mdash; that there should be the closest possible co-operation between the Community in implementing this policy and the Council of Europe.  I also anticipate in this regard that the Community will not be a cultural fortress but that it will have interaction with other cultural organisations and indeed with cultures around the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my statement in the House on 12 December when I reported on the principal issues arising from the Maastricht Treaty, which include, of course, the new provisions on a common foreign and security policy.</P>
      <P>Article J.4 of the Treaty document provides that the common foreign and security policy shall include all questions related to the security of the European Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might lead to a common defence.</P>
      <P>The passage on which the Deputy bases his questions refers to Western European Union as being an integral part of the development of the European Union, the defence policy of which he will note from the passage from Article J.4 from which I have quoted is yet to be framed.  That policy will, on present perspectives, be the subject of an Intergovernmental Conference in 1996.</P>
      <P>Under the Maastricht Treaty, the Western European Union is not part of the European Union.  It is a separaate international organisation established and operating under a separate treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement of that Article that the policy of the Union will not prejudice the specific character of this country's <Col N="61" /> security and defence policy is a most important provision.  It was agreed to at my request to accommodate our national position.  It is specific in its terms and reflects recognition of our traditional position which I was successful in securing in the first instance at the second EC Summit in Rome in December 1990. This was one of our major objectives in the negotiations and the satisfactory outcome fully protects our position in this area.</P>
    <P>The specific character of our security and defence policy has, of course, a number of elements but in the present context, two are particularly relevant: first, our non-membership of organisations whose <i>raison d'etre</i> is that they are military alliances and secondly, that if the Community, or the European Union now to be established, were to develop its own defence arrangements for its security we would consider participating in those arrangements.</P>
    <P>The whole issue will be dealt with in a White Paper, to be issued as soon as possible, in which the Government will set out in detail the implications for this country of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question for future and further consideration.  An invitation will be extended to Ireland to become a member but that is a matter for further consideration.  We would have the option of not becoming a member, becoming a member, or accepting observer status.  It is a decision for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has acknowledged that the Western European Union is in future to be an integral part of the development of the European Union, will Ireland's non-membership of <Col N="62" /> the Western European Union not place us at something of a disadvantage in so far as we will not be part of something that is integral to the development of the union of which Ireland is a member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so, but if there were any argument to that effect then it would always be possible for us to accept observer status.  I shall outline the exact position in regard to the relationship between the European Union, as it will be, and the Western European Union.  The Articles in the draft Maastricht Treaty are fairly specific. The final outcome is to the effect that the European Council, the European Union, will decide which aspects of its foreign or security policy have defence implications and then it will further decide whether or not the Western European Union should be asked to undertake specific assignments at the request of the European Union.  The important issue is that the decision of the European Council in considering that aspect will be unanimous.  It is a matter that will be fully discussed at the European Council, at which Ireland will be present and be participating fully, and the decision as to whether or not to refer the matter or to seek the assistance of the Western European Union will be a unanimous vote of the European Council. To that effect, Ireland will be fully informed and in agreeing to the unanimous decision, are in a position to fully protect our national position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the Government's attitude to the oft-declared neutral position of Ireland? How will he define that position in view of the reply he has given with regard to the Western European Union?  Does the Taoiseach not accept that what is under way is that the European Community are adopting the Western European Union as their defence arm and that the current stance of the Irish Government in relation to that is essentially neutralising Ireland in relation to any input on the future development of a defence of the European Community?  We are, essentially, subcontracting our responsibilities <Col N="63" /> in that regard to a group which has as I said previously, as its first priority nuclear deterrence as the basis of its approach to the defence of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This situation is complex and we should take some time to tease it out.  The first point I wish to make is that the decision of the European Council at Maastricht did not in any way commit us to a common European defence.  That is something that can only be brought forward for discussion and decision at another intergovernmental conference in 1996.  I should like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the wording of Article J.4, which is very significant.</P>
      <P>The first paragraph of Article J.4 states:</P>
      <P>The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions related to the security of the European Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence.</P>
      <P>Those words place anything in the nature of either a common defence policy or a common defence very far down the line. The general agreement is that anything in the nature of a common defence policy or a common defence would be a matter for a further intergovernmental conference. What I have said from time to time is that we have not made any commitment under the Maastricht Treaty to a common defence of the European Union.  Here it is necessary to make a distinction between a common foreign security policy and security policy, defence policy and common defence.  I have always maintained and it is a fact that security is a much wider matter than defence.  The European Union can pursue its security in a variety of different ways by diplomatic effort, by participation in international organisations by promoting disarmament, by the control of sales of weapons and in many different ways.  It is a much broader concept than defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> We fully support the idea of a security policy as such not just for the European Union but for the whole of Europe through the CSCE process.  Common defence policy is a separate concept whereby the Community would evolve for itself some sort of common defence policy.  That might not necessarily involve the Community, or the Union as it will be, bringing forward any specific military defence of its own.  What would ultimately be regarded as a military arm of the European Community would be a common defence.  That is why these three different phrases are used from time to time in a nomenclature.</P>
    <P>Our only commitment at the moment is to a common foreign and security policy.  As yet that does not embrace either of the concepts &mdash; a common defence policy as such or ultimately a common defence.  These are seen as issues to be discussed at another intergovernmental conference which will have to make decisions by unanimous agreement.</P>
    <P>So far as the Western European Union is concerned, it is a separate military alliance.  The Union may from time to time ask the Western European Union to accept particular responsibilities on its behalf.  These might actually be peacekeeping operations such as those contemplated in Yugoslavia.  They do not necessarily encompass military or defence hardware type operations.  The Western European Union in its statements has clearly indicated that it is a separate organisation.  We are not part of it nor are other Community member states, such as Denmark or Greece, as yet.  It is a grouping of nine European member states who have their separate treaty and separate existence as distinct from the European Community.  They will not be assuming any defence role from the European Union except what the European Community decides to ask them to undertake at any particular time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach seems to be in a mood for giving information to the House today, arising from <Col N="65" /> his initial reply to Deputy Bruton's question, will he look further into the crystal ball?  Is he saying that the whole question of Irish neutrality is perhaps not feasible in the context of the discussions that have taken place in Maastricht?  With the inevitability of the invitation to join the Western European Union perhaps the Taoiseach will state, if the invitation was on the table today, what the Government attitude would be?  If we were determined to pursue the traditional neutrality of this country, would it not be in our interests to ensure that the applications by Sweden and Austria are dealt with before any decisions are made?</P>

      <P>Our policy has two central planks, one is that we have not participated in any military alliances which exist solely for the purpose of being military <Col N="66" /> alliances.  What we have said from day one, and this is a common position in all parties in this House, is that if, in the fullness of time, the Community bring forward its own common defence policy, as fully committed members of the Community, we would feel obliged to favourably consider participating.  That is still the position.</P>
      <P>The step of the Union bringing forward its own defence policy is not yet on the table and we did not give any commitment to it in Maastricht.  The position is quite clear.  The European Union in the area of common security policy in regard to any aspects of that common foreign and security policy which has military implications, will ask the Western European Union to consider carrying out certain tasks on their behalf by a unanimous decision.  We will be part of that unanimous decision.  It would be our decision whether the Community should ask Western European Union to take on any particular task.  The tasks it might undertake on behalf of the union would be many.  They could be simple peacekeeping tasks, settling trouble spots in Europe or anything of that nature.  They would not necessarily be anything in the nature of warlike actions.  It is in that context that we will take our decision in the European Council on any particular issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 11 together.</P>
      <P>At our meeting in Dublin last month, the British Prime Minister and I reaffirmed our determination to do everything possible to promote agreement and reconciliation and our support for political dialogue to that end, addressing relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands.  This continues to be the fundamental principle of the Irish Government's approach.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland over the past few months has been exploring the prospects for talks with the leaders of the parties in Northern Ireland who were involved in the earlier talks.  At their meeting in London on Monday last, the Secretary of State and the party leaders reasserted their support for a process of talks based on Mr. Brooke's statement to the House of Commons on 26 March 1991.  However, they concluded with regret that it was not possible in present circumstances to proceed to launch fresh substantive talks on the lines envisaged. They reaffirmed the view that the talks which took place last year had produced genuine dialogue and provided a firm foundation for further substantive exchanges in due course.  They expressed the hope that this would be taken further at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Government's continuing support for, and their determination to do everything possible to help in, this process.  The British Government are fully aware of this position which the Minister for Foreign Affairs again emphasised to the Secretary of State at their meeting yesterday in the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  A meeting with the British Prime Minister does not, therefore, arise at this time but, as Deputies will be aware, a meeting is due under the agreement which I reached with him on 4 December last for half-yearly meetings alternately in London and Dublin, at which all aspects of relations would be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of seeking <Col N="71" /> a joint declaration by all political parties in the UK, I would emphasise that the attitude of the Irish Government to the questions at issue is well known and, while we would welcome an agreed approach by the parties, we would consider it inappropriate in the context of a general election to intervene specially to seek any specific declaration.</P>
    <P>The prospects for political progress in Northern Ireland were discussed at recent meetings with the SDLP.  I do not intend to depart from the understanding under which these meetings are held &mdash; that what is said at them is confidential between the participants.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already made clear the Government's utter revulsion at the appalling loss of life in the County Tyrone bombing last Friday week.  At yesterday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference he reiterated to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the Government's condemnation of the perpetrators of that atrocity.  I know that all Members of this House will join me in expressing our deepest sympathy to the bereaved and injured. The Government are resolute in their determination that every lawful means will be used to ensure that those who resort to terrorism will not succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly join with the Taoiseach on behalf of all members of my party, in condemning the outrage which took place in County Tyrone on 17 January and in sympathising with the relatives of those seven building workers.  I have no difficulty in accepting what the Taoiseach says in relation to the Government's efforts since 1987 in seeking agreement and reconciliation, the fundamental principles of which policy were outlined by the Taoiseach on many occasions in this House and supported. It is a policy which has been assiduously pursued by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs over the past few years.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the statements made yesterday by the Minister for Labour do not concur fully with the policy pursued by the Government <Col N="72" /> in the past number of years?  Perhaps this needs clarification from the Taoiseach at the earliest opportunity. Despite what the Taoiseach says in relation to the British election, does he not consider that a statement should be made by the Government that Northern Ireland should not be a bartering point in the British general election?  It would be very unhelpful, in the context of the efforts of the Government and the previous Government in relation to the Ango-Irish Agreement, should Northern Ireland become a political football in the British general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first point, the statement by the Minister for Labour, I have spoken to him about that and he gave it to me as his view and his clear impression that what he said was fully in conformity with the approach of the Government and that the policy which we have been pursuing since this Government and its predecessor came into office, and which Deputy Spring generously admits has been consisently pursued, is the right policy and has the support of all parties in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the British general election, the Deputy know enough about practical politics to realise that that is a sensitive matter.  It touches on the issue of two member states interfering or appearing to interfere in each other's internal affairs.  I agree with Deputy Spring that none of us would want the affairs of Northern Ireland to become a political issue or football in a general election campaign.  I would be afraid that if we were to make any particular approaches it would inevitably end up in some difficult and unsatisfactory situation. I could not be sure of that but the danger is there and it is a danger we should not risk.  We welcome the position of all the parties taking part in the British general election to support the efforts which have been undertaken for some considerable time in order to bring about peace and reconciliation through political dialogue.  In that connection I remind the Deputy that if the talks had been resumed before the general election both ourselves, <Col N="73" /> and more particularly the SDLP, would have to handle with great care and sensitivity the question of what would happen after the general election in regard to those talks.  As it transpires, the question does not arise because the talks will not now be resumed.  But it is an area which calls for very careful judgment and about which we have been very sensitive. I think the approach to which I have referred in my answer is the right one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree with the view I put to the leaders of both British political parties this week, that is that the great strength of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is that it is an international agreement and, therefore, its provisions and the processes initiated under it cannot be set aside by the results of an election in either State?  Furthermore, would the Taoiseach join me, and hopefully other party leaders on this side of the Border, in calling on anybody, on either side of the Border who has information that could lead to the conviction of the people who perpetrated the murders at Teebane, to give that information to the security forces as appropriate on both sides of the Border.  Would the Taoiseach join me in making that call to anybody who has such information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not want to over-dramatise that situation but it is the duty of every citizen in regard to any matter of that kind, in the case of any crime, to co-operate fully with the police forces.  I am sure that the overwhelming majority of our citizens do so.  I suppose that applies particularly in the case of the more heinous type of crime, such as the atrocity committed.  I could not imagine any right thinking citizen who was in possession of any information in regard to the perpetration of these particular crimes withholding that information from the lawful authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach reply to the first part of my question?  I asked whether he would agree with the view I had expressed to both British political <Col N="74" /> party leaders that the Anglo-Irish Agreement could not be set aside as a result of any change in the political position in one country because it is an international agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Deputy for his efforts in that regard; I doubt if it was necessary but it is no harm to reiterate these things from time to time.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement is a solemn international agreement entered into by two sovereign Governments and, as such, is binding on successive Governments.  As an international agreement between two sovereign States it can be amended, altered or negatived only by agreement between those two member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate with the Taoiseach's condolences to the bereaved arising from the disgraceful massacre that took place at Teebane Cross when eight people lost their lives.  In regard to the Minister for Labour's statement on Radio Ulster, would the Taoiseach confirm in this House that there is no consideration given at Cabinet level to changing current Government policy in relation to Northern Ireland because the Minister suggested in the course of that interview that Fianna Fáil might return to the policies of the mid-seventies and seek a phased British disengagement from the North by agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereas I understand that that is not current Government policy?  Would the Taoiseach confirm that there is no discussion at present on changing the Government position at this time?  Furthermore would the Taoiseach indicate whether he expects the Brooke initiative &mdash; whether or not Mr. Brooke is reinstated as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland after the British general election &mdash; or talks <Col N="75" /> will resume before the summer?  Would he accept that many people in this House and elsewhere find it inexplicable that those talks broke down at such an early stage since they are, after all, only talks about talks, and it seems extraordinary that the politicians in Northern Ireland cannot get these talks under way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must appeal for brevity again and remind the House that I shall be proceeding to deal with other questions at 3.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy would not expect me to indicate what matters are or are not discussed at Cabinet; that is not the way our parliamentary democracy works; at least discussions at Cabinet are intended to be confidential. However, the only thing I can do is assure the Deputy that the policy of the Government, and of the Fianna Fáil Party, is as I have announced it here and reiterated on many occasions in this House.  That is not to say, I suppose, that all of us could not look forward to the day when, through peaceful political negotiations and the promotion of dialogue and harmony, the time would arrive when it would be a quite practical, feasible proposition for the British military authorities to decide that their presence in Northern Ireland was no longer necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach hear or see a transcript of what the Minister for Labour said because I believe that if he did hear it or read the transcript, he would agree that it was insensitive and was an unwise broadcast to have made at present and will not help in the resumption of the talks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having quite an amount of repetition now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to form his judgment on the matter having read the transcript or heard the broadcast.  While everybody would subscribe to the view that we should not interfere in one another's affairs and that <Col N="76" /> Northern Ireland policy should not be used as a football by either or both Governments, at the same time &mdash; and here indeed the Taoiseach himself may be somewhat guilty as was the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brooke &mdash; the door was opened for Unionists to soft pedal on the talks in the event of a hung Parliament arising from the British general election.  Therefore, in that sense we have a legitimate interest in the outcome of the British general election.  In that respect I welcome the undertaking given by the current British Prime Minister and Leader of the British Labour Party that there will not be any question of their being blackmailed after their general election.</P>
      <P>Having accepted what Deputy John Bruton said about it being the duty of everybody to help the law in bringing to justice the people responsible for these acts, would the Taoiseach also take note of the reports in yesterday's financial papers about certain public companies being used as vehicles for the laundering of IRA money?  Would he ensure that every assistance is given to ensure that that does not happen or that there would be any financial institution here that would assist in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now having an injection of new matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation giving the Deputy the assurance he seeks in regard to the last matter.  These matters are constantly kept under review and examination by the Garda authorities.  I am quite certain that they are alert to anything of that nature and would take whatever action was necessary, as they have done in the past.  I remember a famous occasion when the Deputy was in Government, when this party were in Opposition, when we co-operated very fully with the then Coalition Government in regard to funds being transferred from the USA here which were clearly funds to be used by subversive organisations. Therefore the Deputy need not have any problem in that regard.  The Garda <Col N="77" /> Síochána and the security forces generally naturally would be alert to and continually investigate and keep under review that area.  As we all know, the lifeblood of a terrorist organisation is funding.  Therefore, the need to control, restrict and totally eliminate the provision of funds for terrorist organisations is a paramount part of our security policy.</P>
      <P>I overlooked answering Deputy De Rossa's supplementary question which was what was likely to be the situation after the British general election.  Deputy Barry has now adverted to the same matter.  There is no doubt, whatever the outcome of the British general election, very serious efforts will be made to resume the process of dialogue initiated under the stewardship of Secretary Brooke.  There are so many reasons in favour of that that it would be absurd to think it would not happen.  For instance, everybody is agreed that, while the last process did not end in any concrete results, nevertheless the experience gained was invaluable and, in my view and that of my colleagues, left a substantial residue of goodwill, co-operation and recognition of the importance of dialogue which will last for a long time and I think most people would hope it would be built on.  From all we read, hear and know from our own contacts with the British parties it is the wish of all of them that in one way or another, this process can be taken up again and can be progressed. I am quite sure that is what will happen.  I am sure everybody in the House will hope that it will happen.  That has dealt with Deputy Barry's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we can have a brief question from Deputy Currie.  I have asked the House to help me to proceed with as many questions as possible addressed to the Taoiseach today.  I am disappointed with the progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join in the condemnation of the massacre at Teebane Cross, three of the victims were former constituents of mine?  May I ask the Taoiseach whether he would agree that the <Col N="78" /> major purposes of that massacre were first, to force the British Government to introduce internment and, second, to facilitate and try to force a sectarian civil war in Northern Ireland where the Provos would again be able to pretend they are the defenders of the Catholic community?</P>
      <P>Would he agree that, in those circumstances, political progress is of the essence, it is the only way forward.  While I agree with the latter part of what the Taoiseach has just said, would he agree that there are certain things the British and Irish Governments jointly, under the Anglo Irish Agreement, could do in order to facilitate the talks process, particularly in the context of 1992 and the European dimension?  They should consider going ahead.  While there will be no lasting solution without the support of the two traditions in Northern Ireland, the two Governments could go ahead and help the process.  Finally, may I suggest to members of the Cabinet and, indeed to all Members of the House, that often it is not what one says, it is how one says it and where one says it.  Those who give interviews on Radio Ulster ought to be particularly careful.</P>

      <P>On this most recent atrocity, I do not really think it matters a great deal to any of us in this House what the particular motivation was.  It is quite clear that it was an abhorrent deed, one which fills us with revulsion.  The idea that seven ordinary citizens of this country would have their lives suddenly taken away in this brutal fashion is abhorrent to us all.  We are all agreed in our condemnation of it and in our determination to do everything we can, on the security front and on the political front, to bring all this horrible debasing violence to an end.  I agree with Deputy Currie, who in his time has been much closer to this situation than any of us, on <Col N="79" /> the need for political progress.  If there is a vacuum left by total political stultification then that vacuum, as we know to our horror, will be filled by somebody. In our case, unfortunately, here by men of violence.  Everything points to the imperative need for political progress and political dialogue.  I assure the Deputy that in so far as the Government are concerned and, particularly, my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs Deputy Collins, who has primary responsibility in the area we lost no opportunity for that.  In fact, on a previous occasion, I think more than anybody else of the parties concerned, we gave concession after concession and found formulas and compromises to enable the process to stay afloat when frequently it looked as if it might founder. There is no question about that.</P>
      <P>I too share the Deputy's optimism about the European dimension.  I have said here on countless occasions that I see the possibility of a way forward in the European context.  When all the old animosities of Europe are fading away, when the ancient enemies and the countries which were formerly enemies in Europe are now coming together in the closest harmony and co-operation, determined only on the welfare and prosperity of the people, surely that must be a lesson for us.  The fact that we are now all subject to common Community policies, that the Single Market will abolish economic boundaries and that we all send members to the European Parliament in time must have a benevolent influence on the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by the Minister for Agriculture and Food I met representatives of the IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme on 22 January 1992.  The meeting discussed developments in regard to the farm industry and agri-business under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> in particular headage payments, beef premia, Common Agricultural Policy Reform, GATT developments, milk quotas, transport costs for agricultural exports and public liability.  It was agreed that a further meeting would take place after the budget.  Copies of the joint statement which issued after the meeting have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I have had no further meetings with representatives of the trade unions or employer organisations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> since I last reported to the House in reply to parliamentary questions on 17 December 1991.  Such meetings will be arranged if and when the need arises.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware of the concern in many quarters in relation to the possibility of non-pay elements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> being abandoned since the Minister for Finance met the unions and agreed on public sector pay?  Will he give an assurance today that the non-pay elements of the agreement will be implemented in full, particularly in relation to health funding, unemployment and education?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any blanket guarantee of that kind.  The non-pay elements cost money the same as the pay elements cost money.  As Deputies know we are facing a different budgetary situation in 1992; the House will learn much more about that shortly.  It is the intention of the Minister for Finance and the Government to ensure, first, that the <Col N="81" /><i>Programme for Economic an Social Progress</i> stays in place because, in our view, it is the cornerstone of our economic and social policies and, second, that to the greatest extent possible all elements are implemented as was envisaged when the programme started.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there is particular concern in educational circles at the possibility that the non-pay elements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> concerning education might not be adhered to and that that could lead to a reduced quality of education in schools?  In regard to the meeting the Taoiseach had on 21 January which discussed, among other things, the beef premia and the world trade talks, may I ask a number of questions. First, in regard to the beef premia, has the Taoiseach taken any steps to speed up the pay out of these payments to farmers in view of the severe income problem experienced by many farmers, particularly in the west?  Second, in regard to the world trade talks would the Taoiseach consider it useful for him or whoever holds his office, to contact other heads of Government with a view to impressing upon them the seriousnesss for Ireland of the situation that would arise if the Dunkel proposals were accepted and the compensation envisaged in the Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals thereby struck down as a result of which we would have just price reductions without compensation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I know that the Minister for Finance is determined that the aspects of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which concern education will be implemented to the greatest extent possible in the best timescale possible.  Again, I have to say that the situation is governed by the overall financial constraints upon us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the beef premia, we discussed that matter in some detail with the farming organisations.  It was agreed that they would examine various possibilities with the Department of Agriculture and Food to see how payments <Col N="82" /> could be expedited.  They discussed various technical aspects of it &mdash; there is no point in going into them now &mdash; but all sides agreed that this was an urgent matter and that progress could and should be made in regard to it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the GATT negotiations, I can surely suggest that our position in this regard is known around the world.  I myself have spoken time and again in the European Councils about it and the European Community itself, through its negotiators, is very determined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Joint Energy/Environment Council held on 13 December last concluded that: (1) for CO2 stabilisation to be realised in a cost-effective way, higher energy pricing through the use of fiscal instruments is likely to be needed to complement national and Community efficiency programmes; (2) the introduction of Community-wide taxation would pose a range of complex issues including economic and social consequences, and energy policy consequences in member states; (3) studies on these issues are necessary and should be undertaken; (4) the Commission is to put forward formal proposals including proposals for a <Col N="83" /> Community tax taking account of the studies when they become available; (5) every effort should be made by the Community to ensure other countries, notably major trading partners, undertake commitments on the lines of those undertaken by the Community; and (6) the Commission should continue its preparatory work on a Community strategy for the negotiations of a Climate Change Convention and the UN Conference on Environmental and Development (UNCED) process to allow a Council decision in May 1992 in preparation for the RIO Conference.</P>

All countries are hopeful that the RIO conference, which will seek to adopt a global convention on CO2 emissions, will be successful.  The working papers for that conference do not include a proposal for a tax of this kind.  This matter is being discussed within the European Community and I could not forecast what the outcome will be.  I can tell the Deputy however that we have highlighted the many complex issues which would have to be overcome and the difficulties which could be created.  Of course, the difficulties that would be created for trade would be enormous if this tax was to be implemented within the European Community and our trading partners in the <Col N="84" /> world were not subject to such an imposition. Therefore many issues remain to be resolved.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that appropriate eligible energy conservation measures will be considered for inclusion in Ireland's application for Structural Funds aid for the period after the expiry of the current Community Support Framework in December 1993. A decision on this matter will of course have to take account of many factors, in particular the level of resources available; the general arrangements governing the provision of Structural Fund aid in the post-1993 period, including the requirement of matching funds and other competing demands for the funds.  These issues have not yet been discussed in any detail at Community level.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>Although the proposed joint venture to which Deputy Mac Giolla refers is not now proceeding, my policy remains firmly geared towards the establishment of another pulpmill in this country.  I have no doubt but that the increasing availability of timber supplies merits the establishment of a new wood pulp plant. The increased afforestation programme will of course, ensure the continued availability of raw material supplies for such a development and for further expansion of the wood processing sector in due course.</P>
      <P>The promotion of such a project is primarily a matter for Coillte Teoranta, in liaison with the industrial development agencies.  Coillte Teoranta and the IDA have maintained contact with all of the major companies in the industry internationally with the aim of developing early proposals for a new pulp mill which will best meet the growing raw material output of our forests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister the reason a public announcement was made about this project in September 1990 &mdash; that this would be a £150 million project and involve 1,000 jobs &mdash; given that within two months the project collapsed?  Is it not a fact that no agreement was made in September 1990, when this announcement was made, and the Stora project never got off the ground? It is obvious now that there is nothing there to replace it but is it not a fact that at the time Stora pulled out another project went ahead at Magherafelt in Derry involving a Finnish company?  Is the Minister aware of this and can he say if Coillte Teoranta made any approaches to that company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's assertion is <Col N="87" /> not correct.  At the time a statement was issued in regard to the intentions of the Stora Company, the proposal contained two parts, one was an afforestation programme and the other was to proceed subsequently with the construction of a wood pulp mill plant in this country.  That was the Stora intention at that time, it was necessary to make the announcement in regard to the forestry aspect of it and the Department's position was that it would be conditional on the pulp mill proceeding subsequently.  Because of international trading conditions and matters which affected the Stora company's international trading position, the company's management decided not to proceed with the construction of the pulp mill industry here.  That is why the project did not go ahead.  I made that clear in the House on previous occasions and in public statements so there should not be any difficulty about it.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the proposed development in Derry referred to by Deputy Mac Giolla.  My assessment of timber supply over the next few years convinces me that another pulp mill will be required in this part of the country. Accordingly, it is appropriate that we should now be in the process of taking the necessary preparatory steps to ensure that such a development takes place.  As I indicated to the Deputy, the Coillte management and the industrial development agencies are carrying out extensive inquiries in the marketplace to seek to identify a company who are interested in investing here.  These discussions are ongoing and when there is anything to report to the House or the public I will be pleased to do so.</P>

      <P>My policy in relation to mineral exploration in the west is the same as that which applies elsewhere in the country, which is that such exploration should be encouraged and facilitated in order to determine whether mineral resources exist.  In the event of an economically viable mineral deposit being found, Government policy in relation to its development is clear.  It is in favour of the development of the State's <Col N="89" /> natural resources provided this can be achieved in an environmentally acceptable manner.  There should be no blanket bans on mining.  The existing procedures for planning permissions are more than adequate to safeguard the environment. I would stress that I, as Minister for Energy, will not allow any mining project to proceed unless it can be clearly demonstrated through the environmental impact assessment that it meets the very strict environmental requirements I have laid down.

Where screening measurements indicate a level in excess of 200 becquerels per cublic metre, householders are advised of the recommendation to reduce the concentration levels in their homes.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I have taken a keen personal interest in the radon problem.  I have ensured that the Nuclear Energy Board have had sufficient resources at their disposal to deal effectively with the problem and to follow up on initial surveys done in this field.  I shall continue to ensure that priority is given to detection of radon by the Nuclear Energy Board and continued advice to those affected by it.</P>

      <P>In view of the great concern among parents and the significant levels of radon which have been found, particularly in schools, will the Minister indicate whether he has an ongoing programme of work with the Minister for Education to ensure that the many schools, particularly in the western counties to which he referred which have been identified as having such high levels, with the consequent increased risk of cancer for children involved, are made safe?  If not, will a programme of work be undertaken as a matter of urgency to put matters right?</P>

      <i>Introduction:</i>
    </P>
    <P>In framing this budget I have been conscious that at present our society is facing great challenges.  On the home front, the increasing numbers looking for work demand a truly exceptional employment performance &mdash; right through to the end of this decade.  The overriding concern must, therefore, be to safeguard existing jobs and encourage the creation of new ones.  As an essential element in this the public finances have to be kept on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>At the same time, our other &ldquo;homeland&rdquo;, the European Community, is embarking on historic ventures: the creation of a single market from January 1993, and the establishment of political, economic and monetary union.  These present us with tremendous opportunity, and so the Government are determined that we should participate from the outset of both, but they will equally test our policies, our attitudes and our institutions.</P>
    <P>I have, for both reasons, had to keep a prime focus on the changes that a more integrated and open Europe will require. I have had equally to recognise that successful participation in these great European ventures implies certain constraints. If we act wisely, we can share the economic prosperity of our successful partners. We can thereby make real and worthwhile progress in regard to employment and realistically aspire to the standards of social provision that prevail in our Community partners.</P>
    <P>On the broader international front, the repercussions of near-recession in the world economy last year are readily apparent in aspects of our social and economic scene.  I have had to take into account that fact and the expert view that recovery will be slow and patchy.  At the same time, I was reassured by the resilience our economy had shown so far, fortified by the fundamental changes in policy and attitudes under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="332" />
      <i>Review of 1991 Budget Outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the 1991 Exchequer Returns showed, last year's budget outturn was, in difficult circumstances, very creditable. The borrowing targets set at budget time were only slightly exceeded. Tax revenue, after a slow start, picked up in the later stages of the year and ended the year on target.  Within the total, indirect taxes showed the effects of the difficult trading circumstances, particularly in some areas like car sales, while direct taxes took up the slack.</P>
    <P>Non-capital supply services expenditure last year exceeded the post-budget allocation by some £130 million.  The main causes of this overrun have been well documented.  Had the Government not taken resolute action in mid year to contain the expenditure overruns then emerging, the excess of expenditure over budget would have been substantially higher.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the current side of expenditure, Exchequer capital spending came in some £14 million less than the budget provision.</P>
    <P>The outturns recorded in last year's current budget deficit and Exchequer Borrowing Requirement &mdash; 1.3 per cent of GNP and 2.1 per cent of GNP respectively &mdash; were better than had been expected.  The overall borrowing figure of £501 million was less than the revised target adopted in July.  Such an outturn was gratifying even allowing for the benefit of certain non-recurring factors, notably the carryforward of over £110 million of EC receipts from previous years.</P>
    <P>When the proceeds of the flotation of Irish Life are taken into account, net borrowing for the year turned out at only 1 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economy in 1991.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Reflecting international trends, last year saw a slackening in economic activity here after the exceptional buoyancy of 1989 and 1990.  But it was not, for Ireland, a year of recession.  The following highly positive features of broad economic performance last year may be <Col N="333" /> noted.  There was a rise in output of about 2 per cent &mdash; almost as great as my predecessor forecast this time last year. There was a recorded rise of 7,000 in non-agricultural jobs in the year to April last.  Later indicators also suggest that employment continued to hold up well, in contrast with the experience of many other countries.  While unemployment rose steeply as I mentioned earlier, this trend reflected the return of emigrants rather than job losses here.  Price rises were of just 3.2 per cent &mdash; in line with the EMS narrow-band countries; and there was a further &mdash; indeed a record &mdash; balance-of-payments surplus.</P>
    <P>Although the exporting sectors put in a very creditable performance, slowing international activity and high real interest rates led to a fall in business investment.  Consumption growth was very modest, despite rising real incomes; and demand for cars fell well short of the buoyant 1990 level.  Nevertheless, our economy should be set to rebound as confidence and economic activity pick up worldwide.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic Strategy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The essential requirements for success, both in 1992 and beyond, are unchanged: a low-inflation economy; a stable exchange rate policy, with its positive benefits for interest rates, inflation and investor confidence; a moderate approach to incomes and public spending; structural reforms to help growth and maximise its employment intensity; and further progress towards social equity.  These are the core ingredients of the strategy we need in order to give Ireland the highest possible employment and living standards over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The fiscal policy targets set out a year ago in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and reaffirmed in the Programme for Government envisage: the continued reduction of the national debt-GNP ration towards 100 per cent by 1993, principally through restraint on current public expenditure; reducing the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement to 1.5 per cent of GNP next year; and limiting <Col N="334" /> borrowing for current spending to no more than 1 per cent.  We kept those targets firmly in view as we set out the framework for the 1992 Expenditure Estimates and Budget.</P>
    <P>As we approach Economic and Monetary Union, we must have particular regard to the pace of incomes growth in the narrow band EMS countries.  To the extent that increases are not justified by productivity growth they simply translate into higher prices or lower profits, both inimical to our future prospects.  Any exceptional pay increase should be contemplated only in the particular circumstances envisaged under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Finances.</i>
    </P>
    <P>We have, after a period of intensive and very successful correction of our public finances, reached a point where our annual borrowing has been reduced to levels well in line with our Community partners.  The size of our national debt, however, continues to be a problem.  We have committed ourselves to reducing this over time to a ratio close to that of our European partners and this is a target we must reach.  This means being even more vigilant in keeping borrowing lower than other countries with a smaller burden of debt.  The containment of debt and borrowing is not simply a matter of prudent national bookkeeping.  It is central to the Government's strategy for establishing and sustaining economic confidence in all its aspects &mdash; confidence in the currency, the confidence to invest and to expand.  In brief, policy on borrowing is central to the Government's overriding concern with employment.</P>
    <P>We have already, through the published Estimates, defined our broad spending plans for the year ahead.  That leaves the issue of taxation to be dealt with today.  I will be announcing later a number of major changes in taxation. However, in the budgetary context that exists, there is no scope for largesse; it is necessary for the revenue yield to be maintained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" />
      <i>Unemployment.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Unemployment is the single greatest social problem we have to contend with. The Government are keenly aware of the needs posed by the continuing growth in the labour force.</P>
    <P>The overall package in to-day's budget will give a considerable stimulus to employment.  In consultation with the social partners we have undertaken a series of special initiatives to confront the problem of rising unemployment and to accelerate the provision of new employment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Employment and Training Schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following discussions between the Taoiseach and President Delors, the European Commission has now agreed, with effect from 1 February, to provide substantial funds for two new schemes, a new employment subsidy scheme and a new in-company training scheme.  The schemes have received the full support and co-operation of the employer organisations and ICTU.</P>
    <P>The employment subsidy scheme will provide a subsidy of £54 per week for 12 months for up to 15,000 additional employees who have been on the unemployment register for at least two months. The scheme is open to a broad range of employers &mdash; the private sector, commercial State bodies and voluntary bodies.  It will be administered by FÁS. It is aimed at creating additional stable jobs.  In any event the employees in question must be retained for at least six months after the initial subsidised 12 months.  The employers will pay the full going rate for the job to the employees covered by the subsidy.</P>
    <P>The second scheme, the in-company job training scheme, will provide training on the employers' premises for up to 10,000 people who have been on the unemployment register for at least two months.  It has been recognised by the Irish Government, the European Commission and the social partners as an important new development that should become a permanent feature of the Irish training system.  It will be built on a solid basis in order to establish clear long term <Col N="336" /> viability.  The trainees will receive the standard training allowances.  The training programmes will be drawn up in consultation with FÁS, who will also monitor the training provided.  Training on the employers' premises in a business environment is likely to lead to greater employment opportunities than training conducted outside.</P>
    <P>Both schemes will be heavily assisted by the European Social Fund and will not require any increase in total Exchequer expenditure.  The European Social Fund will fund 75 per cent of the training allowance under the training scheme with the balance of 25 per cent being provided by employers.  This is the first time that employer funds have been matched in this way under the European Social Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The employment subsidy of £54 per week will be co-financed 75 per cent by the European Social Fund.  This employment scheme is also a new pioneering development in the use of the European Social Fund in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Overall expenditure on the new schemes is estimated to come to some £70 million in the years 1992 and 1993. Of this, the European Social Fund will now contribute up to some £60 million with the remainder coming from Irish employers and the Exchequer.  The schemes will take effect progressively in line with the take-up by employers.  The funding of the schemes in 1992 is estimated at £24 million from the ESF; £3.5 million from Irish employers and £4.5 million from the Exchequer.  The Exchequer contribution will be offset by an extra equivalent amount from the ESF in other areas of training so that there is, as I have said, no increase in overall Exchequer expenditure in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to acknowledge the significant practical assistance being given by President Delors and his colleagues through these schemes to help us alleviate our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that there will be a formal launch of these new schemes at the beginning of February by the Government and the social partners so as to <Col N="337" /> make sure that their benefits and opportunities are known to all concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Area Partnerships to combat Long-Term Unemployment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> outlined an integrated approach between the social partners, the community and public agencies to implement a community response, in 12 pilot areas, to long term unemployment. The public agencies concerned have put in place the necessary arrangements, including increased resources.</P>
    <P>The total Exchequer expenditure in the partnership areas to combat long term unemployment through training, education and enterprise development across the range of industrial services, agricultural and tourism sectors is now estimated at some £60 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>The European Communities welcome this new integrated way of dealing with the deep-seated economic and social problems of these deprived areas, with special reference to long term unemployment. The Irish Government have just agreed with the Commission that in keeping with the area-based strategy set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and also with the need to tap fully the local enterprise, initiative and support for industrial promotion that was identified in the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group, a new substantial global grant for local development will be instituted.  Under this, European Structural Funds assistance will be provided to promote and assist local socio-economic development. The details of this grant, including the eligible actions and bodies, will now be worked out quickly in further discussions between the Commission and the Irish authorities.  A contribution of about £8 million has been mentioned by the Commission.</P>
    <P>A sum of £0.5 million was allocated in last year's budget to cover managerial and other overhead costs of the 12 local partnership companies.  That provision has been repeated in the recently-published 1992 Estimates.  I am today allocating an additional £0.5 million to <Col N="338" /> meet the expenses which will arise this year from the full-year costs of the initiative in the pilot areas.</P>
    <P>The employer organisations have, as part of their response to the area-based strategy, established an Enterprise Trust. The trust will fund projects identified by the partnerships.  In the forthcoming Finance Bill, I will be providing that contributions to the trust will be eligible for relief of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Task Force on Employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Task Force on Employment, set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and representing the Government, State agencies, employers and trade unions have made a series of recommendations many of which have been, or are being, given effect.  A principal recommendation made by the Task Force related to the desirability of in-company training which has now been taken up in the new in-company training scheme, funded by the ESF and employers that I have already described. Other important recommendations cover the involvement of State commercial companies in linkages to multinational companies, extra third-level places in education and more streamlined planning control measures.  The Task Force, who function on a continuing basis, have provided a valuable new means of harnessing the ideas and insights of the social partners in stimulating employment and reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of Industrial Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Also of major relevance to the issue of unemployment is the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group which has recently been published.  This report represents a significant input to our approach to industrial policy and to how that policy can contribute to increasing employment and living standards in this country.  It contains a large number of recommendations over a wide range of policy areas which will require detailed consideration by the Ministers and Departments responsible.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that a committee of Ministers, headed by the <Col N="339" /> Taoiseach and including the other Ministers concerned, will be set up with a wide remit not only in regard to the recommendations of the group but also in relation to all reports on employment emanating from the Task Force on Employment and otherwise.  The committee of Ministers will be assisted by a working party of officials and private sector individuals.  The direct link with Government will ensure the highest priority for their activities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening Budget Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The opening current budget deficit, based on the published 1992 Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure is £294 million, after allowing for the deduction of £15 million for departmental balances and for the tax implications of the trend in car sales in the year to date.  The opening Exchequer borrowing requirement is £541 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>Public expenditure comprises services which are met from the Central Fund and the ordinary day-to-day expenditures voted by the Dáil for public services.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Central Fund Services and Debt Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1992 Estimate for Central Fund Services is £2,808 million of which £2,411 million is in respect of debt service payments and £384 million is in respect of our contribution to the EC budget.</P>
    <P>Last year, the savings target of £40 million set for the National Treasury Management Agency was achieved and, in addition, the agency were able to take advantage of favourable interest rate movements to achieve further savings of £56 million.  Despite these positive developments it cost the Exchequer £2,353 million to service the national debt in 1991 &mdash; that represents one quarter of total current expenditure and almost three quarters of receipts from income tax.</P>
    <P>The 1992 debt service estimate represents an increase of 2.5 per cent over <Col N="340" /> the 1991 outturn.  This increase is primarily due to the servicing cost of new Exchequer borrowing and to the higher cost of refinancing maturing debt.  The estimate for debt service costs also takes account of £50 million savings to be achieved this year by the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Capital Supply Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>1992 Opening Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The opening position on the non-capital supply services, as published in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure last weekend, is £6,770 million. The variation between this figure and that published in the Abridged Estimates Volume last December is attributable to additional pay costs and to the receipt in 1991 of EC funds which had been expected to carry-forward into 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>The White Paper included £3,720 million for public service pay and pensions. The expenditure adjustments which I will be announcing shortly will marginally increase the figure to £3,726 million.  This is an increase of £311 million or about 9 per cent on the 1991 provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>This increase is accounted for mainly by: the carryover cost of pay increases awarded in 1991; the usual provision for increments; various technical adjustments arising from such matters as the cost of an extra pay day in 1992 for many groups of public servants and adjustments to the Abridged Estimates Volume arising from the early receipt of moneys from the European Social Fund; and the cost of implementing the package of measures put forward by me on behalf of the Government on 17 January last in relation to the implementation of the second and third general increases under the pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and outstanding balances of special pay increases.</P>
    <P>Were it not for this package, I would have had to find more than £100 million extra to fund the cost of pay increases this year.  I am very heartened by the positive response of public servants to <Col N="341" /> the package.  I trust that it will gain widespread acceptance in the weeks ahead and so provide a basis for a return to normal relations between the ICTU and Government and revive that particular part of the consensus approach which underpins the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and on which the Government place such store.</P>
    <P>The package is absolutely essential in 1992 to enable us to keep Exchequer borrowing under control.  It represents the absolute limit of what can be afforded in 1992.  Slippage on the overall provision being made for public service pay in 1992 cannot be contemplated.  Full implementation of the package also commits us to a further substantial increase in the cost of public service pay next year.</P>
    <P>The Government have accepted that commitment in the interests of maintaining the momentum of the agreed approach to solving our problems, both now and in the longer term, which is the essence of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  That being said, however, the Government and taxpayers cannot be expected to continue indefinitely to fund increases in public service pay costs way ahead of inflation.  A far more critical approach needs to be adopted towards the relentless upward thrust in the public service pay and pensions bill both in absolute terms and as a proportion of total voted non-capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Renewed and vigorous efforts must be made throughout the whole public service to reduce administrative costs by achieving greater efficiency.  A way must be found to ensure that any future moves in public service pay are matched by offsetting improvements in efficiency and effectiveness in the areas concerned.  In that context the traditional approach whereby increases which are secured by a relatively small cluster of grades are spread unquestioningly to other groups which are far more numerous and radically different in terms of role and function will have to be challenged.</P>
    <P>A new approach on these lines will raise difficult issues in relation to the determination of public service pay and <Col N="342" /> public service unions will, obviously, have a critical interest in them.  I would hope that discussions will begin with some of these unions fairly soon on an agenda which will enable these issues to be addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reassessment of 1992 Spending Allocations</i>
    </P>
    <P>Adjustments are now required to the White Paper figure for non-capital supply services, following a reassessment of requirements in the light of the 1991 out-turn and certain savings and adjustments made to meet part of the cost of the additional expenditure which I will announce shortly.  These factors allow me to reduce the White Paper figure by £14 million, or £29 million when estimated departmental balances of £15 million are taken account of, bringing it to £6,741 million.  Details of these changes are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget,</i> which is being circulated separately.</P>
    <P>Two of the adjustments to the opening White Paper expenditure position call for special mention.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Administrative Budgets</i>
    </P>
    <P>Three-year administrative budgets are now in operation in most Departments and offices.  The costs of administration in these Departments in 1992 will amount to £572 million.  Under the administrative budget arrangements heads of Departments and their line managers have been given much greater control over the resources at their disposal while being required to reduce costs as part of the new freedom they enjoy.  They are required to plan their use of administrative resources over a three-year period rather than on a year-to-year basis as heretofore.  This emphasis on a planned approach over the medium term is vital to fostering a &ldquo;value-for-money&rdquo; culture in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The administrative budget arrangements provide an incentive by allowing for the carryover of certain savings from one year to the next.  Savings totalling £13.7 million qualify to be carried forward from 1991 to 1992 of which some <Col N="343" /> £11.8 million relates to non-capital allocations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Contribution towards State Security Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The second adjustment I want to mention relates to the State security services area.  Both the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána provide security, such as cash escorts, for the associated banks. Up to now, the costs of these security services have been met from public funds.  I propose to seek a contribution from the banks towards these costs and am making a provision of £2 million for 1992 for this purpose, to be included as Appropriations-in-Aid of the Defence and Garda Síochána Votes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Further Expenditure Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the main non-capital areas where additional expenditure is proposed in this budget, starting with social welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the past number of years the value of basic social welfare payments has been more than maintained against inflation. All long term rates of social welfare payments now exceed the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Short-term rates have been improved also in recent years.  The Government's aim is to bring them into line with the priority rates by 1993.</P>
    <P>I am providing in today's budget for increases in weekly social welfare payments, and these increases once again will give full protection against inflation. In addition, I am providing for special real improvements and some significant initiatives in a number of specific areas. I will now outline the contents of the social welfare package.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Weekly Welfare Payments.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am providing for a 4 per cent increase, with effect from late July, in weekly welfare payments, including health allowances. Thus for the fifth year in succession, the standard of living of social <Col N="344" /> welfare recipients will be well safeguarded. By way of example, the rate of old age contributory pension for a couple under 80 will increase from £110 per week to £114.40.  The 4 per cent increase will cost over £52 million in 1992 and almost £120 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Equal Treatment</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following detailed consideration of a recent decision of the European Court, the Government have decided to provide for equality of treatment in respect of the period of the delay in implementing the EC Directive which provided for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security.  The necessary legal provisions will apply retrospectively from the deadline for implementation, 23 December 1984, to the actual dates of implementation in May and November 1986.  The precise details will be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare when the proposals are finalised.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am providing £22 million in 1992 for the purpose of making substantial retrospective payments.  Further significant payments will be made in 1993 and 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Increase in Short-Term Rates</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government wish to make further progress this year in moving the short term rates towards the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I am pleased, therefore, to announce that, as from late July, all those on short term payments will receive a special additional increase of 2 per cent on top of the 4 per cent general increase. This will mean a £3 a week improvement in the personal rate of all short term payments.  As a result, a married couple with three children in receipt of short term unemployment assistance or disability benefit will get an increase of £5.80 a week bringing the rate up to £124.80 per week.</P>
    <P>The special increase in the short term rates will cost over £4 million in 1992 and just under £10 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" />
      <i>Improved Back to School Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are committed to giving additional support to low-income families dependent on social welfare, who have school-going children.  In line with this, I am happy to announce significant improvements in the &ldquo;back to school&rdquo; payments.  These will increase by £10 per child; to £35 in the case of a primary school child and to £50 in the case of a child in second level education. The cost of these increases will be £2.2 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Provision for Adoptive Mothers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are particularly conscious of the pressures placed on adoptive parents by the lack of provision to facilitate absences from employment related to the adoption of young children.  I am, therefore, very pleased to announce that we will be promoting legislation to provide for leave from employment for adoptive mothers and intend making available a benefit to these mothers along the lines of the existing maternity benefit scheme for women in employment. These new arrangements will operate for ten weeks immediately following the placing of the child with the adoptive parents and will be introduced later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increase in Adult Dependant Allowance with Old Age Non-Contributory Pension</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am moving in this budget to correct a particular anomaly in the area of adult dependant allowances.  At present a person can suffer a reduction in their social welfare payment on moving from the pre-retirement stage to actual retirement at age 66.  With effect from late July of this year, the adult dependant allowance payable with old age non-contributory pensions will be the same as that payable with other social assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>As a result of this change and taking into account the general 4 per cent increase I have already announced, the full adult dependant allowance payable with an old age non-contributory pension will increase from £28 per week to £34.30 <Col N="346" /> per week; an increase of £6.30 or over 22 per cent</P>
    <P>
      <i>Family Income Supplement</i>
    </P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme has been very substantially improved in recent years.  I am again providing for further improvements this year designed to ensure that, when taken with the effect of rate increases in social welfare schemes and changes in personal income tax, the incentive to work is protected and improved for those most likely to be affected.  For example, a married employee earning £8,000 with two children will benefit by a total of £10 per week from combined family income supplement and tax changes.  There will also be further publicity undertaken this year in order to ensure that as many potential beneficiaries as possible are made aware of this scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Grants for Community and Voluntary Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>In recent years the Government have provided increased resources via the Department of Social Welfare to various community and voluntary groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  The Government are committed to continuing this process and, accordingly, I am now providing a further £1 million for the support of these groups in this year's budget.  This is in addition to the £2.36 million provided in the 1992 Estimates. The additional £1 million I am providing today will be spent as follows: £500,000 will be spent on the Community Development Programme.  This is in addition to the £750,000 already included in the 1992 Estimates and it brings the overall allocation for the Community Development Programme to £1.25 million. The increased resources will enable the programme to be extended to a number of new areas.  Details of these areas will be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare; £260,000 will be used to finance a number of pilot projects designed to develop new and more effective approaches to combat the problem of moneylending in low income households. Details of the pilot schemes will be <Col N="347" /> announced by the Minister for Social Welfare; £240,000 will go on once-off grants to voluntary organisations.  This is on top of the £360,000 already provided for this purpose in the Estimates.  The overall allocation, therefore, for 1992 will be £600,000.  The money will be used to assist a number of organisations working with the elderly, the disabled, the homeless and other groups with special needs. Some examples of the organisations that will be assisted are as follows: £50,000 will be given to Aontas for a development programme aimed at women in the home in disadvantaged areas; £25,000 to the national office of the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and £25,000 to Marriage Counselling Services Ltd. and £40,000 to the Galway County Association for the Mentally Handicapped.</P>
    <P>Full details of the other organisations being assisted will be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Combat Poverty Agency</i>
    </P>
    <P>An amount of £250,000 is being provided for the Combat Poverty Agency in addition to the £1.1 million already provided for in the 1992 Estimates.  This brings the agency's overall allocation for 1992 to £1.35 million.  The additional resources will be used to fund a series of measures aimed at increasing supports provided by the agency for voluntary and community-based activities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI Rates and Ceilings</i>
    </P>
    <P>PRSI rates for employers, employees and the self-employed will remain at current levels in 1992-93.  The PRSI ceilings will increase in 1992-93 from £19,300 to £20,300 for employers and from £18,000 to £19,000 for employees and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Total Cost of Social Welfare Improvements</i>
    </P>
    <P>The total cost of the package of improvements for social welfare recipients, which I have outlined in this budget, is £85 million in 1992 and £162 million in a full year.  I trust all will accept that this is a <Col N="348" /> very valuable package in a year of particular financial pressure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-payment Aspects of Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are committed to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and to implementing the economic and social policies set out in the programme.  The programme did, of course, say that implementation by the Government of the various economic and social developments outlined in it would be subject to the overriding consideration that the programme's fiscal parameters would be observed.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to achieve this year budgetary targets consistent with the programme and also implement in full all of the economic and social developments envisaged in the programme, but substantial progress is possible while meeting those targets and my budget provides for this.  This, together with Government policy on public service pay, shows the Government's commitment to the programme.</P>
    <P>The following steps will be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Aids to Farmers in Certain Less Favoured Areas</i>
    </P>
    <P>The provision for the livestock headage schemes in the Abridged Estimates is £95 million.  This provides for the increased headage rates to which the Government had given a clear commitment. Because of the budgetary situation last year, we were unable to bring these increases forward into 1991.  We are, however, prepared to examine ways of compensating for the losses incurred by providing additional funding in 1993 and 1994.  As a signal of our good intent I am now providing an additional £2 million in the current year.  This has been decided on following discussions between the Government and the social partners, and is clearly an initial instalment.  It is the Government's intention that discussions will be held with the farm organisations with a view to further instalments being paid in 1993 and 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Teagasc</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are fully committed <Col N="349" /> to the maintenance of an effective advisory and research effort in the agriculture and food sector.  To this end, I am providing an additional £1 million to Teagasc to enable them to provide a better service to smaller farmers.  This is a significant help to the organisation and to smaller farmers at this time.  We are, of course, conscious of the fact that Teagasc face other considerable difficulties at present. The Minister for Agriculture and Food will be meeting the Teasgasc board in the coming weeks with a view to discussing these problems and arriving at a revised development plan which will enable the organisation to provide, in the best and most cost efficient way, the type of service which the industry needs in the nineties.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Food Inspection and Control</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am also proposing to provide a sum of £1 million in order to improve inspection at meat plants with a view to strengthening controls.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the education sector, I am making available a further £4 million for various <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress-</i>related initiatives to be introduced this year.  This allocation is on top of the substantial increases already provided to cover the full-year costs of the significant measures introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1991.</P>
    <P>Again the principal area to benefit will be the pupil-teacher ratio, which will fall further at both first and second levels with effect from next September.  The 1992 cost will be approximately £2.1 million and the full-year cost about £6.5 million.</P>
    <P>I am allocating a further £1.1 million to supplement the existing provision for caretaking and secretarial services, which will also fund the cost of extra posts of vice-principal and guidance teacher at second level.  This will have a full-year cost of over £3 million.</P>
    <P>Finally in the education sector, I am providing a further £0.8 million to meet <Col N="350" /> the cost of several other measures, namely, those intended to contribute to the relief of problems of schools in disadvantaged areas, to expand the in-service training of teachers at first and second level and to facilitate the regional technical colleges in catering for their rapidly-growing intake of students.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have always been conscious of their responsibilities in the social area and of the necessity to adopt a caring and responsive approach.  This approach in relation to certain vulnerable groups was set out in detail in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The process of implementing this aspect of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was begun last year and I am continuing it in 1992.  I am providing an additional £3 million for persons with a mental handicap.  I am also providing £2 million for childcare and £1 million for the elderly.  The Minister for Health will announce the details.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Olympic Games</i>
    </P>
    <P>To assist with the preparation and sending of the Irish team to the Olympics this year I am making an allocation of £250,000 available to the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Gaeltacht</i>
    </P>
    <P>Bhí méadú i líon na ndaltaí a fhreastail ar chúrsaí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht anuraidh agus tá an chosúlacht ann go leanfaidh an méadú sin i 1992. Tá sé socraithe agam mar sin £150,000 breise a chur ar fáil do scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge atá á reachtáil ag Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post-Budget Non-Capital Supply Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a consequence of the various new expenditure initiatives I have announced today, and a further measure costing £1 million which I will be announcing later in my speech, some £101 million will be added to the non-capital supply services in 1992, giving a new total of £6,842 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" />
      <i>1992 Capital Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The summary Public Capital Programme, published just prior to the Christmas recess, provided for expenditure of £1,869 million.  This, too, falls to be adjusted in the light of a review of expenditure needs.  Adjustments amounting to a net increase of £10 million are required of which some £3 million relate to Exchequer funding.  The effect is to increase the published 1992 Public Capital Programme to £1,879 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Programme Outlays</i>
    </P>
    <P>The provision in the White Paper on receipts and expenditure for non-programme outlays is £45 million.  As in previous years this allocation will allow the Government to meet, if required, any financial restructuring costs of State-sponsored bodies, together with various other miscellaneous capital payments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>European Funds</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ireland's receipts from the EC Structural Funds continue to grow, from just under £700 million in 1991 to over £800 million this year.  This allows public investment to be set at a much higher level than would otherwise be possible without adding to the borrowing requirements. The Maastricht agreement to review the scope and size of the Structural Funds and set up a new Cohesion Fund will ensure that the support from the Community will continue to improve in future years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of Tax Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>In approaching the subject of tax reform I can do no better than quote the Review of the Programme for Government:</P>
    <P>The Government are agreed on the necessity for a programme for pro-jobs tax reform.  The constrained budgetary prospect for the next few years does not take from the urgency of progressing such reform.</P>
    <P>This is the sentiment which informs all the changes I am about to announce.</P>
    <P>There is wide agreement that we would be better served by a tax system with a <Col N="352" /> broader base, allowing correspondingly lower rates.  The message has been endorsed many times &mdash; by bodies representing the social partners such as the NESC and by expert commentators such as the Commission on Taxation, the European Commission, the IMF and the OECD.  Indeed, this is the direction in which we have been going for a number of years now.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> signalled a continuation, even a reinforcement, of that thrust in the interests of both equity and economic efficiency.</P>
    <P>The measures I will be announcing respond also to the recommendations on taxation of the Industrial Policy Review Group.  We stated in the Programme for Government our intention to carry out a radical overhaul across the entire tax code.  We made clear that funding the income tax programme which we set as our objective would, of necessity, involve the systematic curtailment of exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary tax regimes.  In the budgetary circumstances that prevail, there is no other way to progress towards our objectives taken by finding the cost of mainstream reliefs elsewhere in the tax system.  I make no apology for this: it is the essence of responsible tax reform.  I am fully satisfied that the outcome will be a better system on all counts.</P>
    <P>The exceptional buoyancy of revenues of a number of recent years allowed substantial net reliefs in income tax and indirect taxation, the latter with the advent of the Single Market in mind. There is, however, a limit beyond which unacceptable loss of Exchequer revenue would occur.  Accordingly, today's measures will seek to achieve a balance between, on the one hand, reducing the deadweight of taxation on economic growth and the job-creation process and, on the other hand, maintaining the Exchequer's flow.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with income tax.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Over the last few years, in conjunction <Col N="353" /> with the massive reduction in public borrowing which was achieved, the Government made substantial progress in relation to income tax.  The standard and higher rates of income tax were reduced by six points respectively.  The personal and PAYE allowances were increased. The standard band was extended by over 40 per cent.  Last, but by no means least, the exemption limits were increased, and by much more than simple inflation adjustment.  Last October's Review of the Programme for Government set out the Government's intention to endeavour to achieve the objectives of a standard tax rate of 25 per cent with a single higher rate of 44 per cent in the next two budgets.  The review also contained the objective of working towards a considerable widening of the standard income tax band.  Accordingly, I am proposing the following measures today: the existing standard tax rate of 29 per cent will be reduced to 27 per cent.  This rate will also apply to the withholding tax on professional fees and the deposit interest retention tax; the top rate of tax is being reduced from 52 per cent to 48 per cent, so that there will be just two tax rates, 27 per cent and 48 per cent; the standard rate tax band is being extended from £13,400 to £14,950 for a married couple and from £6,700 to £7,475 for a single person; the general exemption limits are being increased from £3,400 to £3,500 for a single person, and from £6,800 to £7,000 for a married couple.  The exemption limits for elderly taxpayers are being increased by a similar amount.  In addition, the marginal relief rate, which applies where income does not greatly exceed the relevant exemption limit, is being reduced from 52 per cent to 48 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am also renewing the PRSI allowance for a further year, at a 1992 cost of £36 million.</P>
    <P>The following are some examples of what these changes will mean in the basic income tax charge for different categories of taxpayers: a single person on PAYE with an income of £10,000 will gain up to £158; a single person with an income of £14,000 will gain up to <Col N="354" /> £337; a married couple with an income of £18,000 will gain up to £254; a married couple with an income of £20,000 will gain up to £544.</P>
    <P>Further details of the income tax changes, showing their effect on different income categories, are contained in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i>  As usual, the Revenue Commissioners will be sending an information leaflet about the exemption limit changes to low-paid taxpayers over the coming weeks; the leaflet will also alert such taxpayers to the family income supplement scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>These measures will cost an estimated £168 million in 1992, excluding the cost of renewing the PRSI allowance.  As I said, it has been necessary to look elsewhere in the tax system to provide the funding for these reliefs.  Let me say at the outset that there will be no change in either the mortgage interest or health insurance reliefs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Life Assurance Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>The tax relief on life assurance, despite the curtailment of recent years, still costs an estimated £8 million a year in terms of tax foregone.  I propose to abolish the relief in respect of all premiums paid on or after 6 April next.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Holding of Shares</i>
    </P>
    <P>The tax code, as it stands, contains a number of special reliefs connected with the acquisition or holding of shares. Having weighed up carefully the various arguments, I am satisfied that the cost involved is not justified by such support as they might give to the capitalisation of business and industry.  Accordingly, I propose to restrict or abolish these concessions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Reliefs for Certain Dividend Income</i>
    </P>
    <P>Individual shareholders in companies liable for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax are able to receive tax-free up to £7,000 or £9,000 in dividend income.  When the relief was introduced in 1986, the purpose was to encourage <Col N="355" /> equity investment by individuals in domestic manufacturing companies.  In practice, however, the relief has been widely abused through contrived arrangements for directors and employees, serving its original purpose to only a very limited extent.  In the circumstances, the relief is being withdrawn, and will no longer apply to dividends paid on or after today. Individual investors in manufacturing companies will still be in an advantageous after-tax position as compared to individual investors in non-manufacturing companies, because manufacturing companies pay corporation tax at a much lower rate.</P>
    <P>Under both export sales relief and the Shannon exemption, the profits derived from the export of manufactured goods and from certain service activities at Shannon were exempt from corporation tax.  This profits exemption ceased on 5 April 1990, but dividends from these exempt profits have continued to enjoy tax-exempt status and there is still an amount of exempt profits in company reserves which have yet to be distributed as dividends.  The continued exemption of these dividends for the individual recipients is difficult to justify at a time when virtually all other income is subject to income tax.  Furthermore, several instances have arisen where there has been manifestly unintended use of the exemption through the contrived substitution of these exempt dividends for normal taxable remuneration.  This is clearly unfair to other taxpayers.  It has, therefore, been decided that the income tax exemption for these export sales relief and Shannon dividends will be abolished on and from today, with the full tax charge being phased in over a three-year period.  Further details are contained in the Principal Features.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Profit-Sharing Relief.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Income tax relief has been available in respect of shares allocated to employees under approved profit-sharing schemes. I propose to abolish this relief in respect of shares acquired by the trustees of such schemes with funds paid over to such <Col N="356" /> trustees on or after today.  The tax position of shares already allocated to employees before today will not be affected; neither will the position of shares acquired before today by trustees of approved profit-sharing schemes but not yet allocated to employees.  Also unaffected will be shares purchased by trustees with funds paid over to them before today but not yet invested in shares, provided that the funds are invested in shares by 5 April next.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Share Options Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am also abolishing the concessionary tax treatment which applies to share options issued to employees and directors. Again, this relief will be abolished in respect of options granted on or after today; the tax position of options granted before today will remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Relief to individuals on loans applied in acquiring an interest in quoted companies.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Income tax relief is available, subject to certain conditions, on interest on loans taken out by employees and directors to purchase shares in, or make a loan to, the company which employs them.  In my view the rationale for this relief is dubious in relation to shares in, or loans to, quoted companies, which have access to capital through the stock market.  I propose, therefore, to abolish the relief in respect of loans taken out on or after today to purchase shares in or lend money to such companies and to phase out the relief in respect of existing loans relating to such companies.  Relief on existing loans relating to quoted companies will, accordingly, be available only on 70 per cent of the amount of qualifying interest paid in the 1992-93 tax year, and only on 40 per cent in the 1993-94 tax year; no relief will be available in 1994-95. For companies which obtained a quotation after 5 April 1991, the phasing out will not begin until the 1993-94 tax year. Where companies obtain a quotation from now on, relief will not be available in respect of loans taken out on or after the date of flotation; phasing out of relief on loans taken out before that date will <Col N="357" /> begin in the second-next tax year after flotation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>&ldquo;Tax-Efficient Remuneration&rdquo;</i>
    </P>
    <P>So-called tax-efficient remuneration has come to play an increasing role in recent years.  This phenomenon is not confined to Ireland; other countries have taken action in recent times to address the inequity this involves <i>vis-à-vis</i> other taxpayers.  I am proposing a number of measures with the aim of ensuring that the treatment of such benefits is brought more into line with that of ordinary remuneration, and that provisions designed to serve a particular purpose are not abused.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Company Cars</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present, a person whose car is provided by an employer is taxed on the basis of a sliding scale &mdash; 20 per cent of the original market value of the car where all costs are met by the employer, falling to 12½ per cent where the car only is supplied.  These rates are very lenient when compared with the costs of private ownership.  When the sliding scale was originally introduced in 1982, it was intended that these rates would be increased substantially for 1983-84 and subsequent years.  This did not happen.  I have now decided to increase the 20 per cent rate to 30 per cent for 1992-93, with <i>pro rata</i> increases in the other rates.  In addition, I am increasing the level at which so-called tapering relief commences. This relief applies when business mileage exceeds 10,000 miles a year.  I have decided to increase the threshold to 15,000 miles and the maximum tapering relief available will be reduced to 75 per cent of the full charge.  These changes will yield an additional £16.2 million in 1992 and £27 million in a full year.  Details of the new scale are set out in the Principal Features.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Preferential Loans</i>
    </P>
    <P>A second area where I consider a tax increase to be warranted is the level of the specified interest rates used to determine the benefit-in-kind charge for preferential loans made to employees by their <Col N="358" /> employers.  At present, the rate is 10 per cent in the case of mortgage loans and 12 per cent in the case of other loans.  I propose to increase these rates to 11 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, to reflect more closely interest rates charged commercially.  I should add that I propose from now on to review the level of these specified rates each year before the budget, to see if a change is warranted having regard to the level of commercial interest rates around the beginning of the year.  The present increases will yield £0.6 million in 1992 and £1 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Fringe Benefits Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>In recent years, there has been a significant increase in use of fringe benefits in the payment of staff.  These benefits are not confined to one segment of the workforce, but are widely available.  An employees is liable to pay tax on these benefits unless they are specifically excluded from taxation.  However, some benefits are difficult to tax accurately or adequately under present arrangements and this is obviously one of the reasons for their popularity.  To the extent that they are undertaxed, the burden of taxation is increased for those taxpayers who do not receive them.</P>
    <P>I am therefore, proposing a radical reform of the tax treatment of fringe benefits. There will be a new tax on fringe benefits, which will be payable by all employers, including those in the public sector, who make use of these benefits in paying their employees.  The tax will come into force on 6 April 1993.  It will follow the general lines of fringe benefit taxes already in operation elsewhere and it will have the following main features: for an initial period, company cars and preferential loans will be excluded from the scope of the tax.  Employees who receive these benefits will continue to be liable for the tax on them; subject to certain other exclusions, to be specified in regulations, the tax will be payable in respect of all fringe benefits provided by businesses to their employees, pensioners and directors; the rate of tax will be the top rate of income tax, and will <Col N="359" /> not be allowed as a deduction in the calculation of an employer's profits for tax purposes; detailed valuation rules will be included in the forthcoming legislation. The Finance Bill will contain enabling provisions in connection with this tax.  Employers will, therefore, have about a year before the tax comes into force to adapt to the new regime.</P>
    <P>There are one or two additional points that I would like to make about this proposal. First, it is very hard to predict what the specific yield from this tax will be. Employers who do not wish to pay it will be able to avoid doing so, by paying their employees entirely in cash which will be subject to PAYE and PRSI in the normal way.  Second, since the tax need not be paid where cash payments are substituted for fringe benefits, its effect on costs should be limited.</P>
    <P>I would like to sound one note of caution. The period between now and the coming into force of this new tax is not to be regarded as giving employers an opportunity to put in place fringe benefit &ldquo;buy-out&rdquo; schemes for capital sums which they might claim to be tax-free.  I am asking the Revenue Commissioners to be on the look-out for any such action and, if necessary, I will have no hesitation in bringing in appropriate counter measures which will apply with effect from today.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Refunds of Superannuation Contributions</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present, where a taxpayer makes contributions to a superannuation scheme, he gets tax relief for them at normal tax rates; where contributions are later refunded, an income tax charge is imposed, but only at the rate of 10 per cent.  Refunds of contributions are running at some £20 million a year and I propose to increase the 10 per cent rate to 25 per cent, in respect of refunds made on or after today.  I would emphasise that there is no change in the tax relief available on the making of contributions to pension funds; it is only the tax charge on refunds that is being increased.  I <Col N="360" /> expect this change to yield some £2.5 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Disability Benefit</i>
    </P>
    <P>As announced by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, before Christmas, the Government have decided that weekly disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit payments would be treated as income for tax purposes, and that the mechanisms for implementing these arrangements were being examined by his Department.  For operational reasons it will not be possible to implement taxation from 6 April next, and it will have to be deferred until later in 1992.  The Minister for Social Welfare is continuing his discussions with the social partners about implementation, and he hopes to be able to announce the arrangements for taxation, and its commencement date, fairly shortly. There will be no change in the tax treatment of these payments until the commencement date.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unemployment Benefit</i>
    </P>
    <P>The taxation of short term social welfare benefits has long been regarded as desirable, and will as I have said begin later this year as regards weekly disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit payments.  The Government have also decided that unemployment benefit will be treated as income for tax purposes.  In order to allow time for the Department of Social Welfare to implement the necessary arrangements, this change will not take place until 1993.  The extent, if any, to which a recipient would pay tax will of course depend on the amount of other income arising in the same tax year. Enabling provisions to establish the tax charge on these benefits will be included in the 1992 Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Withholding tax on fees for professional services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The withholding tax, which was first introduced in the Finance Act, 1987, applies to payments for professional services supplied to accountable persons listed in legislation.  The application of the tax involves the deduction of an <Col N="361" /> amount equivalent to the standard rate of income tax from the payment and the transfer of that amount to the Revenue Commissioners.  The money is then held on account against tax liabilities.  Since full credit is given when the taxpayer finalises his liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners, no extra taxation is imposed on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The current list of accountable persons, which has not been updated since 1988, covers Government Departments, most of the major non-commercial State bodies, the local authorities and authorised health insurers such as the VHI. From 6 June 1992, the list will be extended to include all the commercial State bodies and a number of other non-commercial State bodies such as Teagasc and An Bord Glas.  This measure will yield an additional £2 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deposit Interest Retention Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>As part of the programme for the Single European Market, and as a further step towards European Monetary Union, Ireland is committed to the full liberalisation of capital movements by the end of this year.  In preparation for this, we have already abolished most of our exchange controls.  The main restrictions which remain are on the freedom of Irish residents to open current and deposit accounts abroad.  These will be removed by the end of this year, a measure which will be of significance to the financial sector.  The implications for future revenue from the deposit interest retention tax, and possible measures to deal with that situation, are under examination in my Department and any necessary legislative changes will be provided for in this year's Finance Bill.  There are no implications for revenue in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Section 23/27 Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>The relief on the cost of construction of residential accommodation for letting, generally known as &ldquo;Section 23&rdquo; was extended in the 1991 budget for one final year.  A concession was given to the designated areas, with the specific aim of a better balance in urban renewal, so that <Col N="362" /> after 31 March 1992, these areas would have exclusive access to section 23.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that building firms are coming under pressure to accelerate work in the run-up to the final deadline, in order to ensure that all expenditure on ongoing projects qualifies for relief.  This situation is not in the interest of the industry, or its workforce. Accordingly, I have decided that, where a development is in progress today, expenditure incurred up to 31 July next will qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that this concession only applies to section 23 developments which have at least had their foundations already laid before today.  It emphatically does not cover developments which are at site preparation stage, or which have not yet begun; in their case, the deadline of 31 March still applies.</P>

      <P>A farmer whose herd has been subject to compulsory disposals under statutory disease eradication schemes is currently allowed two accounting periods for restocking before a claw-back of previous stock relief can arise.  It has been brought to my notice that there are circumstances where this period may be too restrictive.  I have, therefore, decided to extend the concessionary postponement of potential clawback to three accounting periods. This will apply to disposals of diseased animals arising after 5 April next.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Overall Effect of Income Tax Measures</i>
      </P>
      <P>Today's package of income tax measures marks a major improvement in our tax system.  In the first place, it involves a significant shift of the tax burden away from personal income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, it brings considerably further the process of reform that has been underway over the past few years.  The standard and top rates of tax are being <Col N="363" /> reduced for the fourth budget in succession. The standard rate band is being extended for the fifth budget in succession and is now nearly 60 per cent wider than it was in 1987.  The marginal income tax rate facing over 700,000 taxpayers is being reduced.  Thirdly, the increase in exemption limits and reduction of the marginal relief rate will be of further benefit to the lower-paid taxpayer whose position has been dramatically improved over the past few years: some 11,000 taxpayers with 12,000 children will be exempted by the changes, and a further 21,000 taxpayers with 30,000 children will be brought into marginal relief.  A further 69,000 taxpayers with 110,000 children, currently in marginal relief, will also benefit from the changes.  Finally, an income tax code which has fewer and less generous reliefs but lower rates will focus incentive on the earning of income.  I trust that employers, who have pressed for this, will respond positively.  All in all, we will have gone most of the way to achieving the objectives contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and made a major step towards realising the goals set down in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>As against the cost of the reliefs package I have announced, the reduction of concessions will yield £38 million, leaving a balance of £130 million still to be found through other tax measures.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the area of business taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am making a number of changes in the corporation tax code which continue the process of reform.  These changes involve closing loopholes, removing anomalies and harmonising tax treatment between different areas.  They will also increase Exchequer revenue, helping to keep borrowing down, and contributing to the cost of the income tax measures &mdash; which will, of course, make for a better <Col N="364" /> business environment.  I will deal first with the financial sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Life Assurance Companies</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i) Acquisition Expenses</P>
    <P>I am proposing a change in the tax treatment of the expenses incurred by life assurance companies in acquiring new business.  These include commissions and relevant management expenses and arise predominantly in the initial stages of the term of the policy.  As things stand, companies may offset these heavy initial costs for new investors against the investment yield relating to existing investors.  As a result, the tax liability of the entire business can be greatly reduced.  This factor is one of the main reasons for the relatively low tax yield to date from many life assurance companies.</P>
    <P>In future, the expenses of acquiring new business will have to be spread over a seven year period instead of being fully offset in the first year.  This adjustment will give a closer match between these expenses and the flow of income and capital gains arising from the investment of the relevant premiums.  The change will apply from 1 January 1992, which is the most suitable date for administrative purposes.  In order to give companies a sufficient interval to adjust to the new rules, there will be a three year phasing-in period, details of which are set out in the Principal Features.</P>
    <P>(ii) Unit Trusts</P>
    <P>Under existing rules, where a life assurance company owns units in an authorised unit trust a capital gains tax charge may, in practice, never arise.  An authorised unit trust is not liable for the tax on the disposal of its investments and the life company would rarely dispose of the units.  I am proposing, therefore, to introduce an annual charge on the assurance company's unrealised gains on the units. The assurance company, in such a situation, will be deemed to dispose of and immediately reacquire their unit holding at the end of each accounting period.  The <Col N="365" /> change will come into effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 1993.  Details of the new charge will be contained in the 1992 Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In certain cases, a life assurance company may own units in and operate a non-authorised unit trust.  It may be advantageous for commercial or other reasons for the company to change such a trust into an authorised trust which comes under the supervision of the Central Bank.  In order to facilitate such a development, I am proposing to introduce provisions in the Finance Bill giving a company the option to make such a conversion, subject to the payment of an appropriate amount of capital gains tax on the unrealised gains on the units at the date of conversion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building Societies</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is to be a change in the tax rules for building societies on the capital gains arising from their disposal of Government securities. Under a long standing administrative practice, these gains were in effect treated as exempt for taxation purposes.  Following a recent court decision and a detailed review of the matter, the Revenue Commissioners are now of the view that such gains should in future be treated as part of the societies' taxable trading income.  Accordingly, the commissioners are changing their administrative practice and are advising the societies that this revised treatment will apply as and from today.  In order to allow the societies a sufficient period to adapt to the new situation, I will be introducing a provision in the Finance Bill, having effect from today, which will phase in the tax charge over a four year period.  The details are contained in the Principal Features.  As a result of the change, the societies will be charged to tax on these capital gains in the same way as are the banks.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Removal of an anomaly in the case of certain branch operations</i>
    </P>
    <P>Certain banks and general assurance companies operating as branches in the Irish market have a taxation advantage <Col N="366" /> over their competitors as a result of an unintended effect of a relief in the tax code.  A financial institution which is set up in the State as a branch of a company resident outside the State is, in practice, able to avail of the tax exemption of Irish gilt income which was provided specifically for non-resident investors. This is a clear anomaly.  These financial institutions are not genuine non-residents; they are carrying on substantial business activities in the Irish banking and general assurance markets.  To provide equality of treatment, I have decided that this tax exemption will no longer apply in respect of gilts purchased after today where the purchaser companies hold the securities for the purposes of their trading activities in the State.  The change will apply only to this limited category of companies.  It will not apply to any other non-resident holders of gilts, because the anomaly in question simply does not arise in their case.  In addition, the companies affected will not be entitled after today to any loss relief resulting from the exemption in question.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Co-operative Societies Tax Exemption</i>
    </P>
    <P>Certain trading profits of agricultural and fishery co-operatives currently enjoy an exemption from corporation tax. Since the introduction of the exemption many years ago, co-operatives have undergone radical transformation.  The distinction between the co-operative sector and other commercial entities has now all but disappeared.  The time has, therefore, come to have them operating under the same taxation rules as other businesses in the same trading areas.  I have decided accordingly that this exemption will be abolished from 1 April next.  Where currently exempt activities involve a manufacturing process they will, of course, qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, while the other activities of the societies will become taxable at the standard corporation tax rate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ring-fencing of Certain Losses with a Company</i>
    </P>
    <P>The present position regarding losses of a 10 per cent company in a group <Col N="367" /> structure is that they can be offset, for group relief purposes only, against the profits of another 10 per cent company within the group.  I have decided to extend the same restriction to profits and losses in the same company.  From 1 April next, trading losses arising from a 10 per cent activity of a company will no longer be allowed for offset against the 40 per cent profits of that company.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Definition of Scientific Research</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following a recent decision of the Supreme Court, it is my intention to amend the definition of &ldquo;scientific research&rdquo; which qualifies for tax allowance under section 244 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, so as to exclude expenditure incurred in the course of exploration for natural resources such as oil, gas or minerals. Further details of the proposed change are to be found in the Principal Features.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Banks</i>
    </P>
    <P>My predecessor announced in last year's budget that a special working group were being set up to examine the corporation tax regime applying to the banks and the role of the bank levy.  The working group have since investigated the question at some length and considered various possible changes in the present regime.</P>
    <P>As a result of this examination, I have decided to introduce new arrangements for bank taxation which will be reviewed again in three years' time.  Under these arrangements, the annual bank levy will continue to be paid during the period 1992-94 at its 1991 level of £36 million. However, if a bank increases its corporation tax payment for the relevant accounting period by a sufficiently high amount so that it exceeds a certain tax threshold, all or part of its levy payment for that year will be offsettable against the excess corporation tax over that threshold.  Further details will be contained in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these proposed new arrangements, while giving the banks an incentive to pay extra corporation tax <Col N="368" /> so as to offset their levy payments, will benefit the position of the Exchequer. This facility to offset the levy where a bank pays sufficiently high corporation tax will also assist the competitive position of Irish banks in the post-1992 EC Single Market.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Annual Wear and Tear Capital Allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>As part of the programme of corporate tax reform, begun in 1988, under which the mainstream tax rate has come down to 40 per cent, the accelerated capital allowances for plant and machinery will terminate on 31 March next.  In view of the consequent significance of the annual wear and tear capital allowances, and bearing in mind that these have remained unchanged since 1968, the Government decided that they needed to be reviewed. As a result of this review I have decided on certain changes to the existing wear and tear regime, which has rates of 10 per cent, 12½ per cent and 25 per cent per annum on a reducing balance basis.</P>
    <P>From 1 April next, in the case of new plant and machinery, there will be a single wear and tear regime for all the assets involved.  This will be a straight line depreciation system, which will mean a total write-off of the assets for taxation purposes by the end of the seventh year. The details are contained in the Principal Features.  Where particular pieces of equipment have a shorter working life and are disposed of earlier, a balancing allowance will ensure full write-off at the time of the disposal.</P>
    <P>Overall, the change will give Irish business a regime which will generally be on a par with the position in the majority of other EC member states.  Being simpler to operate, it will also be of practical benefit to small business in the context of self-assessment.  Furthermore, it will strike a reasonable balance between encouraging investment and promoting employment, which requires that substitution of capital for labour not be made attractive.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Motor Cars used for Business Purposes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The threshold for capital allowances <Col N="369" /> and for allowable running expenses in respect of motor cars used for business purposes is being increased from £7,000 to £10,000.  This increase will apply to capital allowances for cars provided after today and, in the case of running expenses, to expenses incurred after today.  The cost of the change in 1992 will be £700,000 and the full year cost, which will not arise until 1994, will be £17.4 million.  This change will be of benefit to companies providing cars for business purposes and also, of course, to the motor industry &mdash; for whom I will have further good news later.</P>
    <P>
      <i>International Financial Services Centre</i>
    </P>
    <P>The success of the International Financial Services Centre is now evident to all.  Already over 200 companies to employ 3,000 persons have been approved to operate in the centre and there is now a significant and growing new tax return to the Exchequer from these companies.  The Government will continue to encourage in every way possible new entrants who can contribute to the development of the centre to set up before the EC deadline of 31 December 1994.  To date some 550,000 sq. ft. of offices have been completed.  Negotiations are now in progress between the Custom House Docks Authority and the developers for a new agreement to complete the development including a museum, retail facilities, housing and a hotel as well as further office buildings.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Taxes and Stamp Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>I will now outline a number of changes I am proposing in the area of capital taxes and stamp duties.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Gains Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, capital gains tax has been on a self-assessment basis since last year.  I am now proposing certain changes in the structure of the tax so as to streamline it, bringing it more into line with other pertinent areas of the tax code, and, limiting the scope for avoidance practices and the &ldquo;sheltering&rdquo; of income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" />
      <i>Rate Structure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The structure of the capital gains tax offers significant opportunities for tax evasion and avoidance.  I propose to reform the tax so as to reduce this scope. I propose to replace the existing rate structure of the tax with a single flat rate of 40 per cent, effective from 6 April. One effect of this change will be to eliminate the incentive for companies to convert income into capital gains and <i>vice versa.</i>  For individuals, the 40 per cent rate will reduce the attraction of schemes designed to ensure that gains are charged at the lowest existing rate, that is 30 per cent.  One device being used to achieve this goal at present is the issue of loan notes.  This measure is a major reform of the tax code, along the lines recommended by the Commission on Taxation. I expect it to be revenue-neutral.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Annual Exemption for Small Gains</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to reduce by half the current exemption threshold for capital gains tax &mdash; the &ldquo;small gains&rdquo; exemption.  The new threshold will be £1,000 for a single person and £2,000 for a married couple. With the introduction of self-assessment, the original administrative argument for the exemption is no longer so strong. In addition, there is evidence that the exemption is abused through the practice of &ldquo;bed and breakfasting&rdquo; of shares, where shares are sold annually solely to realise a capital gain within the threshold. Today's measure will strike a balance between catering for genuine small gains and protecting the revenue base.  As capital gains tax is collected on a previous year basis, these changes will have no direct revenue effect in 1992, but they will raise an extra £2 million in 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Residential Property Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The residential property tax is payable at present by persons whose houses exceed £96,000 in value and whose income, combined with the incomes of those living with them, exceeds £28,500. These thresholds are due to be increased on 5 April next in line with the new house price index and inflation respectively.  I propose to reduce the thresholds to £90,000 and £27,500 for 1992-93.  The <Col N="371" /> thresholds will be indexed in future years in the usual manner, but using 1992-93 values as the base.  The new levels of these thresholds will continue to ensure that only those properties which are at the upper end of the property market will be subject to the tax.  The extra yield from this measure in 1992 will be £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duty Amnesty</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year's Finance Act changed the nature of stamp duty so as to ensure that, where a potential liability arose, payment of the duty would be assured.  It also updated the interest and penalties on late payment of duty with effect from 1 November 1991.  There are still many old unstamped documents in existence which could remain unstamped as matters stand.  In order to encourage those holding such documents to have them stamped and pay the duty, I propose to introduce an interest and penalty amnesty for documents executed before 1 November 1991. The full amnesty will be available from today until 30 June 1992.  Interest will again start to run on 1 July and the amnesty will end on 30 September 1992. The expected yield from this amnesty is £10 million.  Those holding unstamped documents should avail of this opportunity to put their affairs in order.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Stamp Duty Changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to make three other changes in stamp duty.  First, I am raising the stamp duty on a range of instruments from £5 to £10.  These fixed duties have not been changed since 1982.  The change is to be implemented from 1 February 1992, and it will raise £900,000 in 1992 and £1 million in a full year.  Details are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty on credit cards, which has not been raised since 1984, is to be increased from £10 per annum to £15. This measure will yield £2.3 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>Finally, I propose to introduce a stamp duty of £2 per annum on ATM cards. These cards are increasingly used for a <Col N="372" /> wide range of financial transactions, playing a not dissimilar role to cheques and credit cards which are already charged to duty.  In the circumstances it is fair and reasonable that they should be subject to some charge, and the amount proposed is modest.  This measure is expected to raise £1.5 million per annum.</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Background to Indirect Tax Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>I will turn now to the areas of indirect taxation.  For business people and consumers alike, the key feature of the Internal Market will be the removal of tax checks at borders within the EC.  A main concern has to be to ensure that the differentials between our VAT and excise rates and those of other member states are consistent with safeguarding trade and revenue interests.</P>
    <P>From the technical and administrative points of view, new VAT and excise duty regimes, embracing controls, rates and structures, must be put in place, conforming with the common EC rules.  I hope to include in the forthcoming Finance Bill provision for these changes, to the extent that they have been agreed by the Community, in order to allow the maximum time for businesses and the administration to become familiar with them.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT Rates</i>
    </P>
    <P>In addressing VAT rates this year, I must have regard to agreements already reached at Community level.  As the House is aware, the process of tax approximation within the Single Market requires not only that VAT rates in member states be aligned reasonably closely but also that the coverage of these rates be rationalised.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the VAT approximation negotiations has given us the option to retain existing zero and certain other of our current reduced rates covering sectors of particular economic or social significance.  However, we have also had to accept the prospect of tax increases in areas which have hitherto been favourably treated.  Essentially, this <Col N="373" /> means increasing the amount of consumer expenditure which is subject to the standard rate.  Compared with other Community countries, of course, the coverage of the standard rate in Ireland has been limited.</P>
    <P>The bulk of activities currently rated at 12½ per cent here are, under the terms of the agreements concluded, destined to be liable at the standard rate.  While the adjustment process must be completed by next year, I would not propose to make the transition in one step.  From 1 March, therefore, I am increasing the existing rate of 12½ per cent on a wide range of categories to 16 per cent.  Among the items concerned will be telecommunications, personal services, repair and maintenance services and adult clothing and footwear.</P>

All these will remain at the 12½ per cent rate.  Neither am I adjusting the 10 per cent rate which applies to construction, hotel accommodation, newspapers and short term car hire, on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I do not propose, this year, to make any alteration to the level of the standard rate of 21 per cent.  One important consequence for the Exchequer of the new procedures will be the ending of the payment of VAT at point of entry on imports from within the Community.  This change will entail a cash flow loss for the Exchequer in 1993 of the order of £200 million which cannot be absorbed. Accordingly, I have asked officials of my Department and of the Revenue Commissioners to examine ways of mitigating the shortfall.  I intend to announce details in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <i>Minor VAT Changes</i>

    <P>By way of broadening the VAT base and promoting greater equity in the system, I intend to introduce a number of minor VAT measures in the Finance Bill.  The use of all commercially organised sports and leisure facilities will be taxed at the standard rate of VAT, so will certain items which are currently zerorated whereas competing and similar products are standard-rated &mdash; I refer to snack foods made from corn or maize, bottled waters and certain frozen desserts. VAT registration will also be extended to farmers who supply to other farmers agricultural services to any significant extent.</P>

    <P>In order to assist the export effort of the enterprises concerned, I hope to propose in the Finance Bill, with the necessary approval of the EC Commission, that supplies of goods to designated special trading houses should be treated <Col N="375" /> as exports of goods and, hence, liable to the zero rate.  This will provide a useful cash flow benefit to the trading houses and will put their small suppliers on a par with other exporters.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Excise Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>I will now move on to excise duties.  As I have already said, the advent of the Internal Market imposes major constraints regarding future adjustments of excise duty rates.  With this in mind, I am limiting increases in excise duties to two areas.  With effect from midnight tonight, I propose to increase the tax on cigarettes by 16p per packet of 20, with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products, and to increase the tax on cider and perry by 3p per pint.  Having listened carefully to the views of my colleague, the Minister for Health, I have concluded that there are sound health and social reasons for the proposed increase in the tobacco duties.</P>

      <P>As far as cider is concerned, I believe that its tax treatment is unduly generous compared with that of beer, the current rate of duty on cider being only about one-third that for beer. At this point, I should mention that I propose to legislate during the year for a change to an end-product system in the method of levying excise duty on beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial excise duty on motor vehicles is an area of major budgetary <Col N="376" /> significance.  It is inevitably affected by Internal Market developments in that it is now border controlled.  My intention is that the present initial excise duty on motor vehicles will be replaced by a first registration charge, designed to produce broadly equivalent revenue, but which would not be dependent on border controls for compliance.  Many of the operational arrangements for the new system remain to be resolved.  However, in bringing forward detailed legislative proposals in due course, my aim will be to cater for the new trading environment arising after 1992, while taking account of established administrative control and enforcement arrangements to the extent that revenue collection considerations allow.</P>
    <P>More immediately, I am acutely aware of the difficulties currently being experienced in the motor trade and have decided to take a number of initiatives to tackle these problems within the overall budgetary constraints that exist.</P>
    <P>From midnight tonight, I propose to cut the initial excise duty on cars under 2012cc from 21.7 per cent to 20 per cent. Taking into account the consequential VAT effects, this should reduce the retail price of the new cars concerned by 2.7 per cent.  The customer should save over £300 on a £12,000 car.  In taking this action, I must emphasise again that this does not herald a new era involving the regular lowering of car taxes.  As I have already said, Exchequer requirements simply rule this out, notwithstanding the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Petrol</i>
    </P>
    <P>The wide gap in petrol prices between here and Northern Ireland has been an important factor in cross-Border fiscal shopping in the past.  Although the differential has narrowed in more recent times, it is still significant.  Reducing tax differences clearly has a role to play in promoting an even closer alignment. Accordingly, I propose to reduce the tax on petrol from 1 May next by 2p per litre or by 9p per gallon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>Taxation of Commercial Vehicles</i>
      </P>
      <P>The advent of the Internal Market will put an enhanced premium on competitiveness, particularly for those engaged in international trade.  Nowhere will this requirement be more intense than in the transport and haulage industries, given our peripheral location. Consequently, I propose to abolish, with immediate effect, the initial 6.5 per cent excise duty on certain commercial vehicles.  These will include articulated trucks, lorries, some vans and buses.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Financing of the Motor Vehicle Excise Restructuring</i>
      </P>
      <P>Reflecting the overall difficult budgetary circumstances, I must finance the large-scale motor duty reductions which I have just announced.  I intend to do this in the following ways.  I propose to increase immediately the excise on vans derived from either cars or jeeps to 12.5 per cent of the retail price.  While these are nominally commercial vehicles, I am all too aware that in many instances they have been purchased as an alternative to cars for private motoring purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to increase the rate of road <Col N="378" /> tax for commercial vehicles of up to three tonnes unladen weight by £50 and to increase the rates on other commercial vehicles by about 35 per cent.  Finally, the road tax on private cars will be increased by about 20 per cent.  These changes will take effect from 1 April next. I also propose to take advantage of the changes being made in road tax rates to further the restructuring of categories begun last year.</P>
    <P>I estimate that the various motor vehicle taxation adjustments announced, including the relief on petrol, will cost £13 million in 1992 and slightly more in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Car Hire Sector</i>
    </P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to the shortage of cars for hire which occurred at the peak of last year's tourist season. There are fears of a similar situation arising this year.  Although the excise reduction on new cars which I have just announced should also be of benefit to the car hire sector, I consider that a further specific incentive is needed.  Accordingly, I have decided to set aside £1 million with the primary intention of boosting the supply of cars available for hire to tourists in the peak season.  There will be consultations with the interests involved to see how this can best be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Minor Excises</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now propose to make a number of other excise duty adjustments in anticipation of Internal Market requirements.</P>
    <P>I propose to abolish, with effect from tonight, the remaining duties on larger televisions as well as the duty on video players and camcorders.  I am also halving the duty on LPG used for non-automotive purposes from 1 July next. Finally, in relation to the excise duty on table waters &mdash; in other words, soft drinks &mdash; I have decided that the most appropriate course to follow is abolition. However, due to the difficult budgetary circumstances, this change will be made in two stages.  To coincide with the proposed VAT standard rating of bottled waters, I propose to reduce the current <Col N="379" /> duty on table waters generally by one third from 1 July next.  The remaining duty will be abolished from 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excise Licences</i>
    </P>
    <P>Before I leave the excise duty area, I would like to mention two initiatives regarding excise licences which I will be bringing forward in the Finance Bill, in addition to adjustments of the rates for excise control licences.  I propose that for public house licences charges will be based on the rateable valuation of the premises concerned.  The operation of the rating system has been improved in recent years and now reflects turnover, thus providing a fair means of differentiating between pubs.  Although the same general approach can be validly applied in relation to liquor licences for hotels, I propose, in designing the system, to take account of the fact that the valuation of such premises is based on much broader considerations than bar turnover alone.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing that an annual duty of £100 should be imposed on non-gaming amusement machines.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes in the excise duty in the licences areas which I have indicated will yield about £6 million in 1992 and £9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the combined impact of the various excise adjustments which I have announced, other than those on motor vehicles and petrol, will increase the revenue yield by £29 million in 1992 and by nearly £17 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Concluding Remarks on Indirect Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The wide-ranging indirect tax changes which I have just outlined are in harmony with EC developments to date and further advance our preparation for full participation in the post-1992 Europe.  The net effect on inflation of these changes is estimated at about 0.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Avoidance and Evasion</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is widespread concern both in <Col N="380" /> the Government and in the country at large about the tax avoidance and evasion which have come to public notice within the last year.  These practices have developed despite the sweeping changes in tax administration that have been made in recent years.  It is quite clear that these measures have not been sufficient to deter those in the community intent on evading their tax obligations.  I am determined to do all I can to stop this.</P>
    <P>Tax avoidance was, I would emphasise, a particular consideration in a number of the general reforming measures I announced earlier.  The incentive for avoidance is often a product of the tax code itself, flowing in particular from variations in tax rates and from differential rules.  Addressing unintended use of these provisions, and ensuring that they are not exploited simply to reduce tax bills, is a continuing concern of the Government and the Revenue Commissioners. A less complex, more uniform, tax code would in itself foreclose opportunities.  Moreover, lower rates will tend to reduce the incentive to engage in such practices.  I would draw attention in particular to the steps taken in relation to share-owning incentives, fringe benefits and capital gains.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Clearance</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present, people or companies applying to public bodies for grants or for contracts worth £5,000 or more must produce a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners proving that their tax affairs are in order.  I propose to extend this very successful scheme significantly. The Finance Bill will contain provisions which will enable me to do this.  I will be attaching tax clearance requirements to licences such as those for pubs, dance halls, employment agencies, bookmakers and so on.  This scheme will apply only to licences where the holder can make money from possession of the licence; there will be no question of the scheme applying to licences such as TV licences or driver's licences.  The yield from this measure is very difficult to predict.  I have not, therefore, assumed any contribution from it in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" />
      <i>New Enforcement and Collection Initiatives</i>
    </P>
    <P>The introduction of self-assessment, as well as changes in technology, are releasing Revenue staff resources from traditional areas of work.  Arising from impending changes related to the EC Internal Market, Customs and Excise staff are also becoming available for other work.  It is essential that these staff resources are used to the maximum in the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion and avoidance.  As already announced, I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to put together in 1992 new initiatives in these areas.  Full co-operation and flexibility will be required from the staff unions so as to achieve our objectives.</P>
    <P>Last year the new Revenue collection initiatives brought in £30 million extra in tax revenue.  It is expected that in the current year the yield from these intensified initiatives on the lines I have indicated will increase to £75 million.  I have accordingly provided for a further £45 million in the budgetary arithmetic for 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increased Powers for the Revenue Commissioners</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will contain a number of significant measures which will strengthen the hand of the Revenue in the pursuit of tax evaders.  I propose to extend their power to seek information from taxpayers, their agents and third parties, excluding financial institutions. The powers of the Revenue to search for information will also be strengthened.  I have asked the Revenue Commissioners and my Department to examine the adequacy of existing penalties.  The single rate of capital gains tax, which I referred to earlier, will greatly limit the scope for abuse by, for instance, the use of loan notes in so-called paper for paper transactions. The Bill will also contain other measures directed at this particular form of abuse.  In this context also I will be examining the stamp duty treatment of companies whose assets consist of property. I will be extending the construction <Col N="382" /> industry tax deduction scheme to other sectors and strengthening the legislation governing the Revenue's power to attach the assets of taxpayers.  The fringe benefit tax and other related measures which I announced earlier will, of course, address the under-taxation involved in this method of paying employees.</P>
    <P>Finally on this subject, I would make three points.  First, I am concerned about the practice of backdating documents to try to get around deadlines in legislation passed by this House.  The Revenue Commissioners will pay careful attention to cases where this practice is suspected and, where wrongdoing is discovered, all parties involved will be open to prosecution. Second, I am concerned about the possibility that some auditors and tax practitioners may be co-operating with taxpayers in the evasion of their liability. Any such practitioners will appreciate that they are leaving themselves open to prosecution, and should existing powers in this regard prove inadequate I will have no hesitation in amending the law. Third, I would point out that taxpayers generally who evade their liabilities are liable to prosecution.  While in the past the Commissioners rarely pressed cases to this stage, that will be true no longer; the assistance of the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions will be sought more frequently in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post-Budget Current Revenue Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The net gain to the Exchequer in 1992 of the taxation measures I have outlined is some £14 million.  To this has to be added a factor of £21 million in respect of the revenue buoyancy effects of the budget.  The post-budget tax revenue estimate comes therefore to £8,866 million.  When non-tax revenue is added, taking account of additional national lottery receipts of some £8 million now expected in 1992, the total comes to £9,311 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Budget Deficit and Exchequer Borrowing</i>
    </P>
    <P>The targets for borrowing for the coming year are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> Current Budget Deficit: £339 million, or 1.4 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Exchequer Borrowing Requirement: £592 million or 2.4 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Expressed in general Government terms &mdash; that is the broader statistical measure we will be using in line with the EC generally from now on &mdash; the target budgetary deficit would be within the relevant criterion under the budget deficit mechanism contained in the forthcoming Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>This is a budget of realism.  It set out to reconcile the desirable, from various perspectives, with the feasible &mdash; above all, to stay within responsible financial constraints.  It has had to come to terms with conflicting pressures and tensions and I am satisfied that the correct balance has been struck.</P>
    <P>It is equally a budget of ambition.  It tackles in a fundamental way aspects of our tax system as a whole that are unsatisfactory, and where change has long been called for.  It also takes major steps towards putting in place an indirect tax regime for, the post-1992 era.  I believe that todays measures will not only make taxation more equitable but will also help in realising our economic potential to the fullest, especially our capacity to increase employment.</P>
    <P>It is also a budget of social concern. The Government have shown by their actions, on a broad front, a real interest in the welfare of the weakest in our society, who of necessity rely on the rest of the community.  A particular concern for the unemployed is at the heart of our total economic strategy, which aims at an economy which can generate sufficient sustainable jobs to meet our needs.  Without that, it will be difficult to aspire to better social provisions and services in the future.  At the same time, we recognise the need for new initiatives, and have put them in place to help address the overriding problem of unemployment. We are making progress in employment, <Col N="384" /> though it has been obscured by recent migration trends.  Yet we must show patience if what we have achieved is not to be put at risk.</P>
    <P>Finally, this is a budget of determination. Difficult decisions have had to be taken: expenditure has had to be curbed and tax revenues to be preserved. Overall I can assure the House that the Government never considered any relaxation of the budgetary discipline that has been so important to recent economic progress and to putting employment back on a rising trend.  We were no less determined to keep Ireland on course for full participation in economic and monetary union and for the benefits that can flow from this provided we have the capacity to withstand the competitive pressures that must ensue.</P>
    <P>As I made clear at the outset, my primary concern, and that of the Government, was to produce a budget supportive of employment.  To concentrate only on the period immediately ahead would not have made sense.  The reality is that we will have pressing employment needs for several years to come.  The core budgetary strategy is designed, above all, to protect and enhance growth and employment prospects, both now and over the medium term.  Preserving hard won confidence in economic management is vital to jobs, new and existing.  The budgetary targets set will maintain that and will engender the wider confidence that is so important for growth and investment.</P>
    <P>The budget does not, however, stop there.  It improves the climate for employment creation on a broad front, through measures such as: the fundamental tax reforms, especially in the area of income tax, which give us a system that is pro-work and pro-jobs; the updating of wear and tear allowances, addressing the need for soundly based investment by giving business a regime comparable with general EC standards, and one which will be much easier to handle by business; the rationalisation of motor vehicle taxation, which should help export competitiveness and also give a useful boost to the motor trade and the <Col N="385" /> several measures that will be of assistance to tourism, a sector with considerable job potential.</P>
    <P>Through resolution and single-mindedness, we have achieved a much better tax system and a transformation of the country's financial status.  I am <Col N="386" /> convinced that, with the same national commitment, we could look back with equal satisfaction at our employment record a few years hence.</P>
    <P>I believe this is a budget that will serve the national interest well right through the nineties, and for that reason I commend it to this House.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;from Greencore to the Telecom site, to the Aer Lingus helicopter affair, to the Kinsealy pipeline, to Carysfort and culminating in the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad seeking to implicate the Taoiseach in the telephone tapping scandal of 1982.  These events have rocked the main Government party who are deeply and bitterly divided.  These events have shocked the minor party in Government, who for six months now have sought to give the impression that they are only waiting for the first fine day to pull out of Government.  Events seem to have come to a head.  The resignation of the Taoiseach on the ultimatum of the Progressive Democrats is widely expected and the leadership struggle to fill the expected vacancy is well underway with the free use of all the weapons of such a contest, disloyalty, character assassination and the total disregard of the interests of the Irish people while private ambition is pursued.</P>
      <P>Against this background is it not fair for me to ask clearly what is the status of this budget which is being presented here today?  Is this the real 1992 budget or is it an agreed election platform for the warring factions within the Government? Will the budget survive the dismissal of the Taoiseach and the election of a new Taoiseach especially as the favourite for the vacancy is not even a member of the Cabinet?  Will the present Minister for Finance be the Minister for Finance who introduces the Finance Bill?  After drumming the former Tánaiste and the Taoiseach out of office where will the man from Laramie strike next when he wants to put an extra notch on his gun?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is hard to take this budget seriously against the background of widespread instability which prevails.  This Government are now cruelly and bitterly divided.  The only thing that prevents a general election is fear of the people which is widespread in both parties in Government, and mortal enemies have prepared this budget as a recipe for staying together because they know that if they do not hang together, they will hang separately. That is no way to run a country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the figures on which this budget is based, we find that this is the first budget since 1987 based on an Exchequer borrowing requirement greater than last year's outturn.  The outturn last year was £501 million and the Minister is budgeting now for a £592 million outturn.  We should recall that since 1987 the Government, even though they have reduced the Exchequer borrowing requirement, have increased the national debt by over £4 billion.  I accept that the Exchequer borrowing requirement <Col N="399" /> declined each year but the debt has increased by over £4 billion since 1987. This year the taxpayer, according to the Minister's figures, will pay £2.4 billion in interest to service the national debt.  That is over 10 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>All Deputies will be familiar with the complaint that people do not get value for their taxes, that the level and efficiency of public services is less than they pay for. This is true.  This year taxpayers will pay over £2.4 billion in servicing a debt for services already consumed in previous years.  Naturally they will get no value for that money.  We should remember that in circumstances where the factors of production are quite mobile, both in terms of people and capital, any tendency to increase borrowing will result in capital and skilled people moving to areas of lower taxation.</P>
    <P>The best fiscal policy for any Minister for Finance is to keep downward pressure on the Exchequer borrowing requirement and I would suggest that the Minister has failed the first test.  I replied to Commissioner MacSharry when he was Minister for Finance and to Deputy Albert Reynolds when he was Minister for Finance.  They kept consistent downward pressure on the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  This is the first Minister for Finance since 1987 who has taken his leg off the brake and is allowing the Exchequer borrowing requirement to rise again.  The Minister has also deferred spending until 1993.  This is very serious. It applies in particular to public service pay.  When the public service pay bill, which the Minister says will rise by over 9 per cent this year, is destined to rise by 7.5 per cent next year, principally because the Minister has deferred pay costs from 1992 to 1993, then his 1993 position could continue the trend he has started in increasing borrowing and continuing to increase the debt.</P>
    <P>I also note from the Minister's presentation that he is taking certain measures which will reduce or eliminate deposit interest retention tax.  If DIRT is removed in 1993, as the Minister seems to indicate, there will be a shortfall of <Col N="400" /> over £250 million which will have to be made up.  Not only has the Minister broken the precedent of recent years and started to increase the Exchequer borrowing requirement again but he has put himself or his successor in a position from which it will be very hard to reverse because of the two aspects I mentioned, pay and DIRT in 1993.</P>
    <P>The slide into further debt has recommenced. We should not be too surprised at this.  The last time the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, participated in the same administration between 1979 and 1982, the national debt tripled.  The increases which took place from 1982 to 1987 were largely due to paying the interest on this colossal burden of debt which was put in place by the administration which preceded that of Deputy Garret FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that a new Minister for Finance in tune with modern Ireland would have brought forward a blueprint for job creation which would be significant and satisfactory, something we could get behind, but I am afraid this budget will cause despair among the unemployed.  Despite the massaging of the statistics by various means, the Government are providing in the Social Welfare Vote for an average number of 275,000 persons on the live register.  Real unemployment has already passed 300,000.  It is a sad reflection on the economic management of the Taoiseach that he leaves office with the highest level of unemployment since the foundation of the State, emigration over the past five years at its highest level since the Famine, the national debt at its highest level since the foundation of the State and over one million persons living below the poverty line.  We are told by Fianna Fáil that this is a success.  If this is success, I would hate to be around for a Fianna Fáil failure.</P>
    <P>Despite record unemployment this budget has no strategy to put people back to work.  The measures taken will tend to increase unemployment rather than reduce it.  The Fine Gael proposal to establish a jobs forum is again ignored, even though every significant group, <Col N="401" /> including the social partners, has come out in favour of it.  The proposals of the Culliton Committee which I believe are worthwhile have been kicked so deep into touch that if Ciaran Fitzgerald's difficulties continue he could send for the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; he would nearly be entitled to an Irish cap on the basis of how deeply he kicked the Culliton report into touch.  It is a new device in public administration in Ireland that when you set up a committee or a commission and they report, you set up another committee or commission to look at the report, but the second time you call it a task force.  Sometimes they are the same members, as in this case.</P>
    <P>I ask a very serious question of the Members of this House and particularly of the Government.  Do the Government believe that the present level of unemployment, which is continuing to rise, is sustainable?  How long in their view can we sustain these figures of unemployment before social cohesion is threatened by the very levels of unemployment?  How long will the unemployed take it before they resort to actions other than actions at the ballot box?  This is a very serious situation.  It is a tragedy that a budget speech which lasted almost two hours slithered over our greatest problem and did not come to terms with it in any way.</P>
    <P>In the introduction to the section on income tax the Minister quoted from the agreement between Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats and said they were committed to a pro-job code of tax. We would all be committed to that, but there is a major difference between theory and practice.  The Progressive Democrat theology maintains that there is some great connection between the marginal rate of income tax and employment. There is not an iota of evidence to support this theory.  They have weighted down so much theory on top of the tax wedge theory to try to establish a connection between job creation and the marginal rate of income tax that they probably believe it themselves.  If one says something often enough, people think it is the truth, even though it is not. If low marginal rates of income tax had a <Col N="402" /> favourable impact on employment, why, during the period when the standard rate was reduced by six points from 35 per cent to 29 per cent and the higher rate reduced from 58 per cent to 52 per cent, was that reduction paralleled by the greatest unemployment in the history of the State?</P>
    <P>If the trigger to put people back to work is to lower the marginal rates of tax, there was not much result from the reduction over the past two years.  How can anybody seriously claim on budget day that although when the standard rate was reduced from 29 per cent to 25 per cent and the higher rate from 58 per cent to 52 per cent unemployment went up to 300,000, now because of his move from 29 per cent to 27 per cent and from 52 per cent to 48 per cent everybody will go back to work?  It is the most hypocritical nonsense that has been perpetrated on the Irish people.  People, especially those in the PAYE system, pay too much tax and if the Government were straight about it they would index the allowances and make the reliefs transparent.  They would also extend the standard rate band far more significantly than proposed today.  If people ended up paying less tax, that might have some marginal effect on employment but the theory that if one reduces marginal rates many people go back to work is nonsense and has no basis whatsoever.</P>
    <P>While talking about the taxation proposals in the budget I would like to draw attention to a second aspect of taxation policy.  For example, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement that we would be better served by a tax system with a broader base, allowing correspondingly lower rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister called, as witnesses, the social partners, the NESC, the Commission on Taxation, the European Commission, the IMF and the OECD. Of course, we would all agree with him but in this budget he does not broaden the base to effect lower rates.  He states the theory but his practice in the budget is totally different.  The tax reliefs in this budget are not funded by broadening <Col N="403" /> the tax base; they are funded by deepening the level of other taxes across the spectrum of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued to say that the Programme for Government agreed between Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats involved the systematic curtailment of exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary tax regimes. Fair enough; that is the theory, but the practice is different.  Even though the Minister endeavours to give the impression, to overcome the difficulties in Cabinet that there is a major extension of the tax regimes &mdash; and he goes on to say henceforth there will be no life assurance relief, no support for the holding of shares or tax reliefs for certain dividend income, with about 13 or 14 different reliefs being changed &mdash; the sum total of the yield is £38 million out of a package of £168 million which is all the Minister achieves by eliminating tax breaks, reducing reliefs and all the rest. Yet, he pretends he is funding his income tax package in that fashion.  He is not. What happened was that when it came to the hard talk within Cabinet the £2 billion in relief the Progressive Democrats identified last November evaporated.  Once mortgage interest relief and relief on VHI premia were to continue all they could produce was £38 million so they had to find the money elsewhere.</P>
    <P>One must ask: where did they find it? It is fairly obvious.  First, they found it by doing something which is absolutely outrageous &mdash; they increased the 12.5 per cent rate of VAT across a range of items to 16 per cent but did not use the relevant revenue to reduce the standard rate of 21 per cent.  They shifted it out of the loop and brought it across to the income tax side, which is where they got the £55 million or £56 million about which we are talking.  The Minister created another £45 million by suggesting that better unspecified collection methods would yield that amount.  The Minister also got some leeway by increases in excise, in particular, the 16p on a packet of 20 cigarettes and <i>pro rata</i> increases on tobacco.</P>
    <P>When the Minister could not find any <Col N="404" /> more money to deliver to the Progressive Democrats for the cut in the marginal rates he borrowed it.  The borrowing has risen from an opening position of £541 million to £592 million so that, when he was short at the end, he borrowed £51 million to make up the shortfall; that is where it came from.</P>
    <P>There is a very good case to be made for broadening the tax base, for reducing the rates.  I can agree with the NESC, the Commission on Taxation, the IMF, the OECD and all the other notables quoted in support of the Minister's case but the Minister does not put into practice the theory he preaches.  He got £38 million from the abolition of reliefs and so on and found the rest of the money elsewhere, which is what turns this into a totally bogus budget.  I do not intend going into all the pluses and minuses &mdash; we have all heard the Minister read his Budget Statement &mdash; but a fair summary is as follows: if one does not smoke; if one does not tax one's car; if one does not drink cider; if one does not avail of services such as those provided by one's hairdresser or solicitor; if one holds no ATM card; if one does not eat in the company canteen in the factory; if one is an adult, provided one does not wear either clothes or shoes, then this budget &mdash; if one is on the average industrial wage &mdash; will put approximately £2 per week in one's pocket or approximately the price of two pints.  On the other hand, if one does any of the above, one's relief begins to evaporate very quickly and if one engages in them all the relief disappears very quickly.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the tables the Minister produced at the end of the section devoted to income tax purport to show relief for taxpayers at different levels of taxation. Of course, they are correct if one confines the figures within the income tax code. However, it must be remembered that the same taxpayer will be paying top rate PRSI on another £1,000 of income; the same taxpayer will be paying 16 per cent VAT on his telephone bill; will be paying 16 per cent VAT across a whole range of services; the same taxpayer will be paying 16 per cent VAT on clothes and footwear <Col N="405" /> and will have his car tax increased by 20 per cent.  If one looks at the car package one will note there is a marginal advantage if one buys a new car in 1992 but if one does not then one loses.</P>
    <P>I am not accusing anybody of lying but we must nail the claim by the Minister that he has reduced the marginal rate of income tax from 29 per cent to 27 per cent and the top rate from 52 per cent to 48 per cent and has funded these reductions by expanding the tax base.  He has not; he has done it by increasing VAT, increasing excise and, when he could not get the last £51 million, he borrowed it.  That has all the signs of a Government who had reached crisis point so that on the final day somebody came up with the bright idea: why not borrow it; did we not do it before and got away with it?</P>
    <P>The way the Government have treated VAT is absolutely disgraceful.  For four years now this has been treated as a separate loop within the tax code when everybody knew that the top rate of VAT had to be reduced.  It was reduced from 25 per cent to 21 per cent which was funded by increases in the lower rate of VAT which has risen from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  This time there is an increase in the lower rate of VAT up towards the standard rate, now risen to 16 per cent, with no compensatory reduction in the 21 per cent rate.  This is bad for jobs, it is bad for industry because if VAT rates were reduced, it would create greater commercial activity here. That has not been done which is one of the great tragedies of this budget.  The Minister for Finance has now gone totally counter to the practice of his predecessors and indeed to the spirit of our commitments to the EC to harmonise VAT and excise duty.  It runs against the harmonisation process, using up resources which could be available for reducing the top rate of VAT and income tax.</P>
    <P>I referred in passing to excise duties.  I do not intend dwelling on them in any great detail &mdash; there, again, there are pluses and minuses &mdash; but the total effect of the package will have little or no effect <Col N="406" /> on the creation of jobs or on the number of persons on the live register.  It is quite clear the opening position of this budget was that the standard rate of tax had to be struck at 27 per cent and there had to be a single top rate of 48 per cent. Everything else was bent, shoved and broken to enable the Minister pay for them.  That is not the way to budget for a country facing the degree of unemployment and the economic crisis ours faces at present.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, our biggest industry, got very little mention in this budget; there is no policy whatsoever.  The only significant measure related to agriculture is the decision of the Minister for the first time to tax the co-operative movement. The co-operative movement is one of the vehicles through which people can be got back to work.  It is one of the major vehicles which can be used to avoid the depopulation of rural Ireland.  This is being done at a time when the co-operative movement are readying themselves for a Europe which will be fiercely competitive, when large investments are being made.  It is another blow to rural Ireland by people who just do not understand the position obtaining there.  I am not simply talking about farmers, I am talking about every PAYE man and woman working in the food processing industry in our co-operatives.</P>
    <P>There is great concern here about our health services.  In the Minister's Budget Statement our deplorable health services were allocated six lines.  An extra £3 million is being provided for care of the mentally handicapped.  However, the Minister should have gone further.  The health services are still in crisis.  When we take into account that every health board overran their 1991 allocation, the amounts provided in the 1992 budget are insufficient.  The waiting lists are growing longer and people are still waiting two and a half years for hip replacement operations. Everybody who works in or serves on a health board knows the list in their own particular area.  It is time the Minister adopted the Fine Gael proposal and dedicated the proceeds of the national <Col N="407" /> lottery towards cutting the waiting list.  It is not fair that people should suffer for two and a half to three years before they can have an operation, especially in circumstances where, if one were to go private one could get attention fairly quickly and where if one were fortunate enough to have insurance cover for the Mater Private or the Blackrock Clinic one could probably get treatment even sooner.  The present system is very divisive and many people on low incomes wait years for necessary surgery, often in pain.</P>
    <P>As I said, I was surprised the Minister did not address the problems of the health service today and dedicate the lottery funds, many of which are used as a kind of prize fund for Government Deputies, frittered away and wasted on projects which are not always as worthy as the one I am proposing.  A ready made solution to the problem was to dedicate the lottery funds to cut hospital waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The Minister's social welfare proposals are unremarkable; he has barely covered inflation &mdash; an inflation rate of 4 per cent or about 3.7 per cent at the end of the year &mdash; and is deferring payment until the end of July so that the benefit will be for five rather than for six months of the year.  This was a major missed opportunity. Effectively the Minister has neither targeted new categories in any significant way nor moved in any significant way to relieve the burden of poverty.</P>
    <P>There is great merit in the approach advocated by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  I know the Minister will be familiar with this.  He could do worse than take the main proposals on board.  I believe that if he did, they would have a major impact on the level of poverty. Unlike many lobbyists who come to Ministers and Opposition spokesmen, when they make a proposal they point out how the proposal could be funded, and I believe the Minister would be well advised to look at this approach.  With increasing unemployment &mdash; there are over 300,000 people out of work &mdash; the <Col N="408" /> Minister has a duty to make provision for the unemployed and their families, and over one million people are below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>Last year when I replied to the budget I compared the country to an old banger of a car.  This year the car has a new driver.  I have no doubt but that the driver is skilled enough to negotiate the hairpin bends, to steer clear of the potholes and to avoid writing off the car in an economic drain or a political ditch, but this time next year we will be back where we started with little or nothing achieved.  I recall the words of T.S. Eliot describing his anti-hero Prufrock: he said he measured out his life in coffee spoons.  In this House we measure out our life in budgets.  We go from budget to budget with all the false drama and phony excitement that budgets generate.  In fact, budgets deal with less than 2 per cent of total Government expenditure for the year.  They are very flawed vehicles for dealing with the kind of problems our country is facing.</P>
    <P>For 14 years Irish politics have been dominated by two larger than life personalities: the present Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  The departure of Deputy Haughey signals the end of an era.  It is time to reflect on where we want to lead the people.  I believe it is time for a departure and I suggest that we start here.  No organised group anywhere in the country would conduct their business in the incompetent irrelevant manner that we conduct business in this House.  If there were such a group I believe this House would intervene to prevent them acting in such a way.  We must build a society which is democratic in its truest sense, where people take pride in the highest standards and take personal responsibility for their own lives.  We must provide them with the legislative framework so that they can take personal responsibility for their lives.  We must build a society where the teacher in the school, the nurse in the hospital, the Garda in the street and the worker in the factory are proud of what they do and know that the whole community are proud of their high standards. <Col N="409" /> We must share in that pride in our country and we must protect our beautiful environment and its potential for one of the best lifestyles anywhere in the world. The environment is of crucial importance not only to our social life but to our economic life, in fact, it is too important to be left to the Greens.</P>
    <P>For the past 30 years all our employment policies have been one dimensional. The theory was that if you could build a strong manufacturing base this would lead to jobs for everybody and rising living standards.  The IDA and other agencies were mandated to lead this drive.  It is as if because we missed out on the industrial revolution 150 years ago, we felt obliged to replicate it 150 years later.  I am not one of those politicians who knock the IDA; they carry out their mandate well and have made a major contribution to the industrialisation of the country but they should be encouraged to proceed in a more focused fashion to attract as many new knowledge-based and high-tech industries as possible to the country.  I believe this kind of industry is compatible not only with the environment but it is suitable for our highly educated population.</P>
    <P>However, there are other ways to create jobs which would be equally useful and compatible with the environment and attractive to our young educated people.  A job in a hotel, in a leisure centre, with a pop group, as a film maker, or as an actor is as real as a job in a factory and may provide a more satisfactory way of life for an educated young person. However, while the average cost of a job in manufacturing industry is £20,000, if you want to be an actor, or a film maker or if you want to go into the tourist business you will not get a single penny from any agency.  Why is our attitude to job creation so one dimensional that manufacturing industry and service industries defined as manufacture, can attract such high levels of grant while we ignore many of the great strengths in our community as if they had no relevance to our lives? We have many strengths.  For many years we have acted as if there was one string to the national bow.  We had to attract <Col N="410" /> foreign investment to create jobs in manufacturing industry.  There was no other way of doing anything.</P>
    <P>We must now play to our other strengths and a priority is the tourism industry. I am amazed that the tourism industry is totally neglected in the budget; it was completely neglected also in the Culliton report.  That was a very serious omission from an otherwise fine report.  I believe that a properly marketed modern high standard tourism industry could create thousands of extra jobs provided there was political will, a proper plan, a redirecting of investment to allow EC Structural Funds to be used for upgrading accommodation.  In my view, we have never thought big enough in terms of tourism.  There are many examples right across Europe, not only in places where the sun shines all day but in the northern European countries, where very successful tourism industries have been developed in which thousands of people are employed.  We have the necessary fundamentals for enormous expansion in tourism given the new disposition of many European tourists to move away from the sun.  Why should we not capitalise on our strengths &mdash; clean air, a beautiful environment, educated young people and pure and untainted food &mdash; and put many of our people back to work?</P>
    <P>The food industry also need a new mandate.  The Government promised this in 1987 when they fought the election. The beef tribunal is the measure of the Government's failure in the food industry. It is a national disgrace that we are not the pure food larder of Europe exporting untainted products at a premium price to the housewives of Europe and providing good jobs as a result.  Any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy must make this a priority but all that it ever gets is lip service and passing references in the Agriculture Estimate. In the budget today one of the prime areas in regard to job and wealth creation has been totally ignored.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the Government have no policy on the arts at a time when our <Col N="411" /> young people are to the forefront of artistic activity.  Young people in the western nations look on Ireland as a vast resource for musical talent while we are aware Irish made films are the height of fashion across the world and Irish drama is dominating again on Broadway.  Yet, we have no policy on the arts and culture except the dilettantism of the Taoiseach posing as policy.</P>
    <P>Would not a job in a drama workshop &mdash; I understand they are trying to develop one in Galway &mdash; be as good as a job in a factory for many a young person? Would it not be of benefit for somebody with no job?  Would it not allow them to use their creative talents in an alternative way?  Would not a job teaching English as a foreign language in Dublin be regarded as a good job for an Arts graduate? Yet, the Government, through the Industrial Development Authority, will invest £20,000 per job making widgets in Tallaght and will not spend one shilling to turn Dublin into a major centre of English language teaching.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> There are areas of life which have huge potential for economic development and job creation as distinct from cultural development but all of these have been totally ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wanted to make these points because I believe the Government are looking at everything through the wrong end of a telescope.  In effect, all the Minister has done is rearrange less than 2 per cent of Government spending today in a well packaged manner.  He read his speech very well but at the end of the day it will not make one iota of difference to the economic or social life of the country.  On the margins there will be winners and losers and there will be marginal winners <Col N="412" /> and marginal losers but in terms of economic or social policy it would have been just as well if the Minister never came into the House.</P>
    <P>We have a great country.  Many people have a very good lifestyle and we could plan for other people to share this lifestyle but instead of this the Minister has presented us with what is, in effect, an accountant's budget, a budget which offers us no vision of how Ireland will generate growth and provide the jobs that are necessary to take the whole population forward in a modern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If this budget has any purpose or priority it is to deliver, for the third year running, large tax cuts to those on high incomes under the guise of tax reform.  Since 1988 the top 20 per cent of income earners in Ireland have scooped the pool in the almost slavish copying of the Thatcherite tax cuts implemented in the United Kingdom, under the entirely spurious guise of tax reform.  Apart from that, this budget sets no national goals or objectives.  It seeks to inspire nothing.</P>
      <P>The budget I believe, must be judged primarily for the impact it makes on employment, tax reform and the increasingly critical social agenda. Unfortunately, it fails all these tests dismally. In fact, one of its most notable features is the wide range of needs about which the budget has absolutely nothing at all to say.</P>
      <P>Specifically, on the question of job creation and unemployment, the overall impact of the budget, which will be neutral, will do nothing to stimulate investment or job creation.  The continuing cutbacks in the Public Capital Programme will also have a serious negative impact.  The budget reflects the incapability of the Government to recognise that special interventions in the form of job placement schemes for the long term unemployed are the only short term means by which they can hope to participate in paid work again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the budget, the Government are effectively turning their backs on the long term unemployed.  The miserable schemes announced today, which will not <Col N="413" /> involve one penny in extra spending by the Exchequer, will do little or nothing to help the unemployed, especially the long term unemployed.  The switching of Structural Funds to areas of high unemployment, though welcome, is in effect robbing Peter to pay Paul and in any event involves a tiny amount of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to protect personal and PAYE allowances against inflation.  People on higher incomes are the main beneficiaries of this and the last three budgets.  The hidden inflation tax on these allowances since 1986 amounts to £125 million in a full year.  This hits the low and middle income earners in the tax system hardest.  If there had been nothing but indexation, the income tax yield would have gone up this year by a sum of £190 million.  As a result of all the reliefs the Minister has announced in the budget, income tax will still increase this year by £50 million.  This figure will be further increased by the extra VAT imposition on a range of essential commodities, including telephone bills and transport costs which bear heavily on the unemployed and people of modest incomes.  Nobody can describe this as a reforming budget where income tax is concerned.</P>
    <P>The minimalist social welfare increases in the budget have been put back further in the year, to the end of July.  Before they are received they will be swallowed up for many families in extra clothing and telephone bills and in higher VAT charges on a range of essential services. For the past few years the budget has been immediately followed by significant increases in local authority rents, for example.</P>
    <P>In general terms, it is impossible to find any significant redistributive factor or measure in the budget, except one.  The taxation of a range of short term benefits which people at work have paid for through social insurance is now a way of encouraging the poor in many cases to subsidise the very poor.  In particular the disgraceful treatment of child benefit, for the sixth year in a row, shows how little the Government are aware of family poverty. Child benefit needs to be increased <Col N="414" /> by between £2 and £3 per child to maintain the value it had in 1986.  Instead, the Minister has done nothing and the net effect will be to reduce the real value of child benefit once more.  The Minister, and the Government, owe £27 million to the mothers of Ireland.  The increase in the back-to-school payments announced and the slight increase in the family income supplement will do nothing to alleviate poverty in any real or lasting sense and will not address the ongoing needs of mothers in every home in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable case for a radical extension of the carer's allowance and how can the Minister for Finance decide that 60,000 voluntary carers in Ireland, who save the State hundreds of millions of pounds each year, should not merit even a mention in this budget?</P>
    <P>Extraordinarily, the budget is entirely silent on health.  Everyone knows there is a crisis in this area.  Indeed, most people have had personal experience of the acute shortage of resources which has applied for years.  The people of Ireland will not easily forgive a Minister for Health who turns a blind eye to these critical needs with one high profile exception, the exemption of VAT on equipment which was purchased using voluntary contributions.  The Minister has decided to forego a tax take on the voluntary contributions of ordinary citizens who are trying to make up for the deficiencies in the health services.</P>
    <P>The Government are already £15 million behind in their commitments under their own report, &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo;, which also recommends the spending of an extra £11 million in 1992 on vitally needed services and facilities for the handicapped.  An extra £3 million this year will not even paper over the cracks.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the area of housing. Your experience in Dublin Corporation, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will give you an acute knowledge and awareness of the extent of the problem at present.  The Government have been afraid to publish &mdash; I challenge them to do so &mdash; the statistics on homelessness which they have had since last May.  It is well known that <Col N="415" /> the so-called social housing scheme has been a bureaucratic disaster.  Against this background the absence of any meaningful provision for house construction in the budget will make a bad situation considerably worse.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the areas of legal aid and overseas development aid, to take just two examples.  I put it to the House &mdash; and indeed to this divided Coalition Government &mdash; that there is a consensus throughout the country that urgent extra resources are needed; the only place in which a consensus does not apply is in the Cabinet room itself.  In many ways the failure to deal with legal aid and overseas development aid is a perfect example of the basic lack of generosity and imagination in the budget.</P>
    <P>These are my initial reactions to the budget delivered to the House.  However, I will give a more considered reaction, one which I attempted to anticipate in advance because I have known the Minister for Finance for some time.  This budget could have provided hope, given a sense of direction and told us what a new and young Minister for Finance wanted to see for his country.  It does not do a single one of these things.  It is a timid and cautious statement from a tired and impoverished Government.  We are not a poor people or an under-developed economy; our society, though under threat, is not fragile and our traditions of community are strong.  However, we are seriously failing to tap those traditions and to build a consensus which would meet the employment needs of our people without impairing the equal needs for productive efficiency.  In one word, the essence of our problem is leadership. I searched for leadership in this budget but I did not find it and I do not believe any objective commentator or analyst will find it; it is a conservative budget in the worst sense of that word.  It is willing perhaps to tinker with existing structures but afraid of any real change or any kind of risk, unmoved by any sense of priority or commitment and completely without a vision of how Ireland should or could be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> This is the first time a budget has been overtly used as part of a campaign for leadership by an aspiring candidate.  That is why, when the budget is assessed, it cannot be described as jobs or taxpayer friendly but it can most certainly be described as Bertie friendly.  Its one and only purpose is to enable the Minister for Finance to tell his entire party that he is safe and that if they elect him as leader he may not do very much but at least he will not make too many mistakes, that he is a safe pair of hands.</P>

      <P>We have to wait until Saturday to see the next match but this debate is really one of confidence.  It is the first part of the background against which this budget must be judged.  The second part is that the budget debate is a confidence debate and it can and should be used to examine the performance of the Government over the entire gamut of economic, social and political issues. It is, after all, their response to those issues.  Under any of those headings the Government have been an abject and dismal failure.  I will be referring to the economic and social aspects of the Government's performance when I look at some aspects of the budget in detail. However, I must say a few words about their political performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on the day this Government were formed if anyone had said that before they had been two years in office the Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and three junior Ministers, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, Deputy Smith and Deputy Treacy would not just have resigned but would <Col N="417" /> in effect have been sacked and that the Government would still be in office they would not have been believed.  If anyone had predicted that the man from Laramie, whose title is the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, would be in a Government which were the most scandal ridden in the history of the State, that the Taoiseach would be brought to his political knees, as no doubt you will have to preside over tomorrow, Sir, by the resurrection of GUBU by no less a person than Senator Doherty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  As I was saying, if anybody had predicted even one of the things which I just described which are fact, he or she would have been regarded as insane and perhaps ruled out of order by you.  However, two and a half years ago the Leader of the Labour Party said that one of the biggest questions they would face would be the way in which power would be exercised.  He instanced a number of examples of unsavoury and secret behaviour of the outgoing Government and he warned that the style and substance of that kind of Government could not be allowed to continue.  Alas, continue it did until we have now arrived at the point where it is not just a failed <Col N="418" /> Government but a disgraced Government. They have only one reason to stagger on, fear of the electorate.</P>
      <P>In May of last year, before any of these scandals broke, the Labour Party moved a Bill in this House, the purpose of which was to enable politicians on all sides of the House to operate with total transparency and to increase the extent to which we are willing to be accountable to the people and ourselves.  We did not move that Bill because of sanctimoniousness but because we believed that accountability is good for politicians as well as for politics.  The Bill, which was voted down by the combined forces of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, was the Ethics in Government and Public Office Bill.  In the course of the debate on tha Bill our spokesperson, Deputy Howlin, made the following point:</P>
      <P>In the last couple of years we have debated issues of all sorts in this House.  The Goodman affair, the principle of privatisation, broadcasting, the Gallagher bank collapse, the purchase of Carysfort, the refurbishment of the Temple Bar area, the Custom House Docks site, the Finance Bill are just some examples.</P>
      <P>They all have one thing in common &mdash; they all involve sensitive commerical decisions and they all involved powerful interests outside this House. In other words, we are making decisions every day that can affect the economic interest of a wide range of groups and individuals.  Inevitably, the potential for corruption in that situation is huge.</P>
      <P>I am not saying or implying that there is corruption in our political system but I do believe very strongly that there have been many situations in the past, including several of those I just mentioned, when the political system &mdash; and more importantly the citizens who elect us &mdash; would have benefited greatly from the fullest possible transparency and accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were prophetic words last May. Unfortunately for all of us the evidence <Col N="419" /> of recent opinion polls confirms that the public now distrust all politicians when their anger and distrust should be focused on those politicians in Government who have brought about this situation.</P>
    <P>This Government cannot ever say they were not warned about the scandalous situation they would face and the need for transparency in their approach.  All of the warnings were spurned.  As a result, the secretive and authoritarian style which has characterised this Government has led to a situation where this budget is being presented to the House under a dark and immovable cloud, the cloud of suspicion and disgrace.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, this is an unreal budget.  It does not matter in a sense whether it belongs to the Progressive Democrats or Fianna Fáil, even though both parties will undoubtedly make their own childish claims about it.  This budget is unreal because the Government is unreal, uncertain of its timespan, consumed by personal animosities and committed to nothing except survival in office for its own sake; it is certainly not for the sake of the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>There was a time in Ireland when we had an economy which existed to serve the people.  It now appears that it is the people who serve the economy.  It is pointless to talk about the economy doing well if the people who are supposed to be the backbone of that economy are suffering.  It is pointless to talk about economic indicators as if the economy was somehow different from the people who live in it, who try to raise their families in it and who desperately want to work in it.  It is pointless to talk about young people as our greatest asset if it is an asset we export in the largest quantities.</P>
    <P>With each day that passes people are making choices.  This week the people who live in the real Ireland are deciding what they must do without in order to put meat on the table.  That is the kind of choice which will still have to be made next week and the week after.  Nothing this Government do and, tragically, little <Col N="420" /> or nothing in this budget is going to make those real choices any less agonising.  Yet this Government say that the economy is doing well.  However, the Estimates they published earlier and the budget published today are monuments to an economy without any real hope for those who are marginalised and disenfranchised. After all the years of hardship, it is as if the last few years of belt tightening and sacrifice had never happened.</P>
    <P>When the Estimates were published before Christmas I pointed out that they provided an extra £276 million for the entire range of public services for the next year.  Virtually every penny of that was already spent on pay and increments to which the Government are already committed together with extra spending on unemployment caused by the failure of the Government to translate extra wealth in the economy into enough extra jobs.  What that meant was that across a whole range of essential social services &mdash; health, social welfare, education and the environment &mdash; not one extra penny was provided for vital social reconstruction or to even begin to address the fundamental shortfalls which have bedevilled social policy in Ireland for the past five years.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I would be devoting most of my speech to economic and social issues.  I make no apology for saying that I believe these issues can be summed up in three words &mdash; unemployment, unemployment and unemployment. Unemployment is at the very core of many of our fiscal problems.  For example, the budget overrun last year was largely accounted for by the excess spending on unemployment-related payments. It is at the core of the grinding poverty that afflicts thousands of families. It is at the core of many of our mounting health bills, contributing as it does to thousands of cases of depression, stress-related conditions, violence in the home, alcoholism and a host of other problems.  Most of all, unemployment is at the core of our equality crisis.  It is not an accident that unemployment is at its highest in many of the devastated and alienated suburbs of our larger cities and <Col N="421" /> towns.  It is not an accident that it is at its highest in areas where access to education is poorest.  It is not an accident that unemployment, poverty and disadvantage form part of an ever-ending vicious circle of inequality.</P>
    <P>For me and the Labour Party, unemployment is a disease within the body politic which, if it is allowed to rise endlessly, will destroy this country by alienating its people and shattering the bonds of community.  For the Labour Party, whose very name and origin are based upon the right to work and the rights of all workers in our society, it is now crucial that we find new ways, new policies and new ideas to provide meaningful work and a decent income for all who seek it. This is not a problem which can be easily solved &mdash; I readily accept that &mdash; but it is not and never will be acceptable that we are prepared to tolerate our present level of unemployment.  Let us make no mistake about it, the people who are unemployed are the forgotten readers of this budget.  What this budget is saying to them is that high unemployment is not only inevitable but is acceptable to the level of 275,000 for 1992.  In other words, this budget effectively disenfranchises those without work.</P>
    <P>We need to be honest about this.  There is now an essential need to redefine the historic relationship between the industrial labour force and the needs of efficient and productive output.  In the past the relationship between labour and output changed dramatically in the agricultural sector and we adapted successfully to that.  Today with the advent of new technology we can and do produce more with fewer in manufacturing as well as in agriculture, and we have to adapt to that.  If we were to deny this change we would be consigning ourselves to oblivion in the increasingly competitive world in which we live.  As long as Ireland exports two-thirds of its output into a global economy competitiveness is vital to us.  All modern political parties are basically agreed on this point.</P>
    <P>However, beyond this common position it is now obvious that there is a clear distinction in Irish politics between Left <Col N="422" /> and Right.  There is a deep divide between us in the Labour Party, with our view of a social democracy where we need to make room for everybody, and the economic democracy of the Right of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats where there is only room for those who are needed.  The difference is that the Right regard the unemployed as basically surplus to requirements.  They see the rights of citizenship being bound up with their concept of economic usefulness.  On the other hand, the Labour Party believe that access to meaningful and sustaining work is a basic right for every citizen.  It is also an essential requirement of our society if we are to maintain social cohesion and personal liberty and offer people any sense of equal choice.  The combination of meaningful work and a basic income capable of sustaining choice is the fundamental objective of our political philosophy. We believe that Ireland can and must make room for every citizen, that Ireland needs every citizen.  It would appear that our political opponents claim the right to pick and choose who is needed, and only for them will there be room.</P>
    <P>Last year in the budget debate I referred to the 100,000 Irish citizens who were left high and dry by the prolonged increase in unemployment.  By April 1991 the number of people out of work for 12 months or more exceeded 100,000 and the number out of work for six months or more was 145,000.  When the previous Minister for Finance presented his budget in the House this time last year there were 232,807 people on the live register.  Much to my regret, and I would say to the regret of the entire House, this new Minister or Finance is formulating his budget against a background of 269,214 people on the live register, an increase of almost 37,000 during the past year.</P>
    <P>Last year we called on the Government to totally revamp the employment incentive scheme by increasing the level of subsidies, securing the active support of the social partners so that 20,000 of the long term unemployed could be guaranteed <Col N="423" /> a quota of the available vacancies each year.  Is it not a scandal that the one scheme which the Government can utilise to help the long term unemployed has not been fully utilised this year?  Part of the Minister's unspent departmental balances were accounted for by underspending of the extremely small budget for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Instead of the tentative toe in the water approach to unemployment by the Government we believe that a back to work programme must be launched both at home and in Europe.  Before we can start reducing unemployment we have to stop redundancies in going concerns and focus incentives to offer job guarantees to the long term unemployed.  We have to promote incentives to increasingly share work rather than add to the numbers depending on social welfare to make a living.  We have to put forward proposals which with the backing of Government, employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, could make a real differnce to the unemployed.  What the Government's policy on unemployment amounts to is in effect paralysis by analysis &mdash; reports, committees and task forces but no leadership and no real commitment to tackling unemployment.</P>
    <P>When the data on the breakdown of unemployment by duration on the live register is available for October 1991 we will be looking at a figure of close to 130,000 people who have been out of work for 12 months or longer, and by April that figure could rise to 150,000.  A feature of the rise in unemployment in the last year in particular has been the growth of unemployment among those under 25 years of age, a rise of 14,000 or 40 per cent of the increase.  It could be argued that the real level of unemployment is already over 300,000 for two reasons.  First, the total number of persons under 65 years of age who are on the pre-retirement allowance scheme is over 11,000 &mdash; the qualifying age was lowered from 60 to 58 years with effect from April 1991 &mdash; and, second, if we take into consideration the approximately 30,000 people on social employment <Col N="424" /> schemes and on various training schemes offered by FÁS it is clear that the 300,000 figure has been broken.</P>
    <P>What has been the Government's response?  Did they launch an initiative to secure European Community action on unemployment for all of Europe prior to Maastricht?  No.  Did the Government finally admit that we have an unemployment crisis of potentially catastrophic dimensions?  No.  Have the Government responded to demands endorsed by all the Opposition parties, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and voluntary bodies representing the poor for a forum on unemployment?  No.  Have the Government admitted the truth, even at this late stage, that their response to unemployment is stupefyingly conservative? No.  Last year the Labour Party strongly objected to the minuscule provision of funding for schemes &mdash; £500,000 to be precise &mdash; to target the long term unemployed in particular and, indeed, all unemployed people so that they could return to work in the foreseeable future rather than remain prisoners of dole queues for the nineties.</P>
    <P>Essentially my message this year is that what was needed above all on the issue of unemployment was leadership and hope &mdash; leadership from the Government and hope for the unemployed.  I have some good news for the unemployed who may be dismayed by the contents of this year's budget.  Labour have given a lead in that we have shown, as we did last year, that policies can be put in place which will offer work to the unemployed provided we have the political will to tackle the issue at home and carry the battle into Europe, particularly at the level of Heads of Government and the Council of Ministers but also in the European Parliament and, not significantly within the privacy of the Commission.</P>
    <P>With a European Community labour force of about 150 million and 15 million European citizens unemployed in the Community, the problem of the 300,000 unemployed in Ireland can hardly be described as an insuperable problem in this context.  Of course our unemployment level is intimately linked to the <Col N="425" /> unemployment level being experienced in our largest trading partner, the United Kingdom, with whom we have had historically a common and shared labour market.  When unemployment rises in Britain, just as night follows day, unemployment rises in Ireland through a combination of a fall in outlets for our school leavers and indeed the return of emigrants who have lost their jobs in the UK.</P>
    <P>One might have thought that ten years of policies, largely based on the proposition that reductions in income tax automatically led to high levels of employment, would have been discredited completely not only as a way forward for the people of the United Kingdom but as a way forward for the Irish Government and the Irish people. Yet this budget is driven by the discredited proposition that reductions in tax rates are the key to solving the unemployment crisis.  The budget has effectively put the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> on ice.  The casualites of the budget, apart from those who are already on the rack of long term unemployment, will be seen later this year in the lengthening homeless queues, the waiting lists for hospital beds and in a whole range of areas which are largely covered by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>What has happened is that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has been put on ice in respect of the commitments and aspirations for progress in employment in particular and in some of the social services which the Government and the trade unions agreed to in October 1990.  In their place have been substituted the priorities of the revised Programme for Government.  On the second page of that revised programme are listed ten objectives for Government policy over the lifetime of this Dáil, which is clearly a moveable feast.  None of those objectives refers to explicit measures to deal with unemployment. The section on employment creation refers to the task force which has been established and the special area programmes which are meant to address the issue of long term unemployment, <Col N="426" /> albeit on a budget last year of £500,000 and this year of the princely sum of £1 million.</P>
    <P>The key objectives outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> apart from the first point of sustained economic growth, were, in the second and third points, a substantial increase in employment.  However, the Labour Party do not believe we are powerless to achieve real progress on the employment front.  We do not accept that unemployment has to keep rising and that we simply have to wait for somebody else to solve our problems when it is painfully obvious that we must take the lead.  We must first make a commitment to ourselves that we will tackle unemployment in a comprehensive manner and with a well thought out plan.  Once we have made the decision to tackle unemployment we must then focus on the long term, medium-term and short term response in terms of policies required.  We must also look to policies that need to be adopted by the European Community so that we are not always working against the tide of factors which can overwhelm our best endeavours at national level to increase investment and employment.</P>
    <P>The first critical issue here is industrial policy which needs to be changed fundamentally at European level so that Europe develops the industries of the future which can match both the Japanese and the United States, with the objective of maximising employment within the territories of the European Community.  Second, we need a European Community-funded system of incentives for investment which will benefit all the regions.  This of course must be preceded by a fundamental re-examination of the levels of national incentives which currently prevail in the stronger regions and which when combined with our inherent geographic and market disadvantages further exacerbate the problem of regions such as Ireland in attracting investment from within the Community and indeed from outside it.</P>
    <P>Ireland's unemployment problem is not unique.  There are other regions in <Col N="427" /> Europe, not only in Spain, Portugal and Greece but also in the centre of Europe, which are suffering acute employment problems.  It is with these regions that we must build positive alliances at Government level, trade union level and business level.  It is now up to the Government not to assess the Culliton Report but to start to implement it.  We have left it quite late in the day if not too late to develop our indigenous manufacturing industry.  We have left it late in the day to build selected companies to a sufficient size and scale where they can produce self-sustaining long term growth in exports and jobs.  It is absolutely vital that we now get on with implementing a policy of selectivity in placing our limited resources in the best possible sectors where we can hope to compete in Europe and, within those sectors, to concentrate on key Irish companies. However, we realise that even with the best will in the world and the necessary real political courage in implementing the Culliton Report we cannot expect the benefits from a new industrial policy to come through in substantial employment numbers until well past the mid-nineties.</P>
    <P>The crucial political question then which may involve the survival of our democracy and our system of Government is what we are going to do about the 300,000 and, indeed, more of our citizens who will have no work unless we adopt the kind of radical proposals we have put forward.  In this again, there are both national and European dimensions which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Nationally, we must make the commitment that we are going to tackle unemployment in a serious way now.  An appropriate declaration to this effect would be a commitment from the Government as Government to participate actively and willingly in partnership with all the parties in this House, the social partners and representatives of the unemployed and the poor, so that we can quickly develop a consensus on policies and move ahead with their implementation.</P>
    <P>We did it before.  Seventy years ago, <Col N="428" /> in 1922, this House divided on the Treaty imposed from outside but the New Ireland Forum reached a consensus on the national question which is now shared by every political party and which has effectively removed the divisive the Civil War which were so destructive of the national effort for over 50 years.  We are not an impoverished people.  We formed a consensus in the New Ireland Forum on the issue that most divided us on this part of the island.  We should be able to do the same in the context of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Second, at European level, we need the introduction of a special fund, an unemployment fund, which will be resourced from new resources added to the existing Community budget, and which can be made available to all the regions in Europe which are experiencing unemployment above the average rate for the Community.</P>
    <P>We need a new institution to respond directly to the needs of the unemployed. We know, and nobody knows better than I, that FÁS must be reformed and unified in a specific agency that helps in the provision of proper on-the-job industrial training as recommended in the Culliton report.  The remaining functions of FÁS and part of the working of the Department of Social Welfare should be transferred to a new body, which I would call Saothair, which would develop and manage a whole range of varied and carefully designed series of intervention programmes in the labour market.  At present, Sweden, with just 4 per cent out of work in its labour force and a historic national commitment based on consensus to full employment operates the most successful labour market intervention agency in Europe.  Ireland, with a 20 per cent rate of unemployment in general and 130,000 long term unemployed, many of whom are 25 years or younger, faces a unique challenge.  We must respond and can respond with a range of targeted full-time and part-time commercial and community based initiatives to provide meaningful work for those who seek it in our community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> The Industrial Development Authority will face major changes in their role, as proposed in the Culliton report.  I hope the Goverment have the courage to initiate this change.  However, in addition to the change contemplated, I suggest that the Government seriously consider merging the IDA, CBI, as the CTT is now known, and Bord Fáilte personnel in locations abroad thus creating one stop agencies for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to the promotion of small industry, it is obvious to me at any rate, that there should be a much greater role for local authorities.  The IDA may well need to shed some of their powers.  The way to do this is to integrate the IDA activity on the ground with the local authorities in the immediate future.  Indeed, at a time when Fianna Fáil were in the majority on Dublin City Council, the Council launched a proposal for some class of an enterprise board for Dublin. It is obvious that we must all travel down this road.</P>
    <P>Above all, what we need in the next five years is a substantial rise in our productive capacity &mdash; that is a rise in productive investment, instead of infrastructural investment, however welcome such investment may be.  The European Commission's Annual Report for 1991 noted that in Spain and Portugal the convergence towards the European Community average for living standards was investment-led, whereas in Ireland it was still export-led.  The report concluded that the investment ratio was still relatively low here and has not increased in recent years.  It suggested that more emphasis should be given to the development of production potential.</P>
    <P>This, of course, leads to critical questions of choice in our industrial policy. It requires a commitment to providing equity finance on a long term basis for the develoment of selected indigenous Irish companies.  It requires a much more selective approach by the IDA to inward foreign investment, because we know from the Culliton report &mdash; indeed we knew from the Telesis report ten years ago &mdash; that almost 40 per cent of the jobs created in grant-assisted foreign projects <Col N="430" /> are gone after seven years.  We simply cannot afford to repeat this disastrous level of performance for the remainder of the nineties.</P>
    <P>While we can look to and, indeed, expect an increased share of the wealth which the new Single Market in Europe will generate, the primary responsibility for developing employment has been and will remain with ourselves in the medium-term. It is unrealistic for us to expect the development overnight of a large European-financed industrial budget or unemployment budget which could bring down the rate of unemployment to acceptable levels.  None of us expects that.  None is so naive.  That does not mean, however, that it cannot be achieved in a longer time frame.  We could seriously aim towards that if work was started on the political level.  As is confirmed by today's budget we are in a bad situation right now, and it is becoming worse, at least temporarily.  It is projected that 270,000 people will remain unemployed for the duration of 1992. But, as the Labour Party have shown, we can overcome our difficulties.  There are some promising signs.</P>
    <P>The external environment over the next year is likely to be more favourable than in 1991.  World trade will grow by approximately twice the 2 per cent level achieved in 1991.  This will be good for our exports which are already performing strongly and suggests that the Irish economy will have a minimum growth rate of 3 per cent and, indeed, could easily surpass the forecast growth rate in the Minister's budget.  I welcome those positive signs and I hope they are maintained.</P>
    <P>The OECD estimate that economic growth will be a full percentage point above that achieved last year.  And, while GNP growth will be modest at 2.2 per cent it will be followed in 1993 by a further increase of 1 per cent over 3 per cent.  So we are in an environment where economic recovery is taking place in the main industrial economies of the world to which we sell over 90 per cent of our industrial and agricultural products.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the immediate <Col N="431" /> period ahead, that is 1992-93, independent forecasters suggest unemployment in the UK will continue to rise and this, of course, will have further major implications for our domestic unemployment level.  Unemployment rose faster in the European Community as a whole in 1991 than in any year since 1983.</P>
    <P>Let me raise the question of interest rates.  The rate of interest also affects the unemployed.  A matter which is of great concern to mortgage holders and small holders is the level of interest rates in our economy.  Not everything started in 1987. A great deal of work was done a long time ago to bring about the low inflation level achieved since 1985.  A low level of inflation, and our rising balance of payments surplus, in all other circumstances would point to the possibility of a sharp reduction in interest rates but that has not happened.  When the German interest rate was raised before Christmas it was open to our Central Bank to wait and monitor the flows of capital and assess whether a matching increase in our rates was required. However, in reality, I do not think that option was open to the Central Bank. Just as an increase in rates in December 1990 was followed by a cut, I believe there is the climate now for reducing interest rates.</P>
    <P>The domestic market is signalling that interest rates should come down.  Monetary policy has in fact worsened the cash flow position to individuals and businesses and has contributed to an unnecessary credit squeeze which is reinforcing the lack of confidence which now exists.  I am amazed that the Minister made no reference to the ongoing credit squeeze which is a fact of life in this economy and which is hurting severely small and medium sized enterprises. Anybody who has an ear to the ground must hear that message.  The two main banks are consistently denying that there is such a credit squeeze, yet if there were a relaxation on interest rates, for which we believe there is some room, the credit <Col N="432" /> squeeze could in fact be eased.  It is somewhat of a mystery to me &mdash; and, I suggest, to most people in this country &mdash; that our interest rates cannot drop below those of the United Kingdom when, in terms of financial ratios, our economy is performing so much better than that of the United Kingdom.  We also have the other ridiculous situation now that the Irish economy has interest rates that are one-quarter of a percentage point above the lowest rates available in the United Kingdom, If anything, the opposite should be the case.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister for Finance, at the earliest possible opportunity, to call in the major financial institutions for talks to establish what their views are; what are the market rates of interest that currently apply to one-month and three-month money?  The Minister for Finance should then convey a strong message to the Central Bank that interest rates are currently too high and are in excess of the levels required to maintain the position of the Irish pound within the narrow band of the EMS and sustain the appropriate level of reserves to protect our export and import requirements.</P>
    <P>Of course, unilateral action by the German Bundesbank in raising interest rates for purely German domestic policy reasons should not have gone unremarked by our Government.  Indeed, those economists in our society who were suggesting that we permanently link our currency to the Deutsche Mark were, in effect, saying that the German Bundesbank should become de facto the European Central Bank and the Deutsche Mark become the European currency without the need for establishing a real central bank with the full powers of a European Central Bank and accountable to some kind of democratic authority.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately &mdash; and there is a certain irony in this &mdash; the German action cannot be taken as a one-off action and may be likely to recur later this year if inflationary pressures in the German economy prove too strong on the wage front.  The appropriate action which Germany would be advising any other country in <Col N="433" /> the European Community in such a situation would be to take proper fiscal measures, including increase taxes, to force down the level of domestic inflation.  We need to press this point with the German Government in the Council of Ministers.  There is no evidence to date that economies such as those of Ireland, Portugal, Spain, or indeed, the northern European countries are making that concerted point at the ECOFIN meetings.</P>
    <P>I shall now turn to the issue of taxation. On examining the Exchequer returns this year, I believed that there was little scope for a tax-cutting budget unless social services were to suffer yet again.  In a number of budgets the Minister for Finance has come into the House and announced reductions in the standard rate of tax.  Any such reductions have on each occasion been welcomed by the Labour Party.  However, what the Minister was giving with one hand he was taking away with the other.  By not increasing personal allowances, by not increasing the PAYE allowance and by providing marginal increases in the standard rate of tax and tax bands which were below the increases secured in incomes each year, what in fact was happening was that the Minister was clawing back a substantial proportion of what he appeared to be giving in the reduction of the standard rate of tax by pushing larger amounts of income into the higher tax bands.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party believe in a system of progressive income taxation. We believe that there should be higher rates of tax for those on higher incomes. But £10,000 per annum for a single person is not by any standard a high level of income; £12,000 is not a high level of income, nor, indeed is £15,000 if it comes to that.  In this day and age, neither is an income of £25,000 a year in any sense a high level of income for a family with a mortgage and children to look after.</P>
    <P>That is why our main objective for the next three years is to have all single taxpayers on incomes of up to £12,500 and married couples on incomes of up to £25,000 having their taxable incomes <Col N="434" /> taxed at the standard rate and not at the higher rate.</P>
    <P>What in effect has been happening is that over the past four budgets those on incomes in excess of £20,000 per annum have been getting substantial tax relief in each budget.  When we are looking at the effects of any action the Minister takes on budget day we have to look at the combination of the interaction between the taxation measures on the income tax side with pay increases which, generally, apply in percentage terms and at the indirect taxation measures which are broadly regressive in that they take no account of income levels or ability to pay them.  They affect the lower income group to a much greater extent than those on middle or higher incomes.</P>
    <P>This year we calculated that it would take about £175 million of income tax relief in a full year to prevent the burden of income taxation rising.  In formulating the Labour Party response to this year's budget, I submitted that the main relief should be in the areas of increasing personal allowances &mdash; in particular, the PAYE allowance &mdash; and by a substantial increase in the standard rate tax band of £7,500 for a single person and £15,000 for a married couple.  We also proposed to give additional relief to those on lower incomes by utilising savings from restructuring the PRSI allowance and using the £58 million saving entailed to introduce an initial low rate of PRSI of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>In a budget which has given large tax cuts to those on incomes in excess of £30,000 per annum and which has ignored the totally regressive nature of PRSI levels, which unfairly hit the lower income groups, the only move which I mention unreservedly is the substantial increase in the standard rate tax band.  At last this Government have acknowledged what we said before last year's budget as well as before this budget.</P>
    <P>We identified sources of funding for our major programme measures on tackling unemployment.  Basically we pointed to the elimination of tax loopholes in the corporate taxation area, one of which was signalled by Culliton, namely, the ending of section 84 soft loans.  The <Col N="435" /> ending of those measures would result in a figure of £125 million additional revenue.</P>
    <P>Last year, in relation to the problems that might be envisaged by the harmonisation of VAT rates and the possibility of capital outflows after 1 January 1993 in relation to DIRT, I suggested to the Minister that he raise these issues at the European Community and discuss possible financial assistance or, indeed, other measures to ensure that there was to be no Exchequer loss in 1993.  All that we have got so far is an indication that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners will consider that matter in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill and that there will be no Exchequer or revenue effect in 1992.  That we know, but in the light of the concern that has been expressed by all the financial institutions about the security of their deposit base, a more substantial statement was necessary today at budget time than the very slight and passing reference contained in the Minister's budget speech.</P>
    <P>There had to be some Exchequer loss in reducing the main VAT rate, which has been recouped to some extent by an increase in the lower VAT rate, but I question the wisdom of any further reduction in the main VAT rate when the British rate is now at 17.5 per cent. However, it would have been opportune to take the VAT rate down to 20 per cent anyway and, as Deputy Noonan has already said, the additional revenue that will come from increasing the VAT rate from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent in regard to some areas is not being used within the family of VAT to reduce the overall VAT load but, in fact, has been transferred to finance some of the savings on the income tax allowances that have been granted.</P>
    <P>Many people will have an opportunity to speak in the debate and will have available to them more time to prepare than I had when listening to the Minister's speech of one hour and 45 minutes. However, when this budget is analysed and the measures that have been introduced are considered in detail, when the <Col N="436" /> calculators are brought out and the measurements are applied, it will be shown to be a budget in which the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance officials can take substantial pride because there is a great deal of administrative tidying up in it. Nine complicated and time-consuming loopholes and tax allowances, most of which only a small coterie of people have ever heard of, have all been abolished. The total saving, when that is all put together, amounts to the princely sum of £38 million.  I am glad that the budget will make life easier for the officials and the citizens in the Revenue Commissioners and, perhaps, in the Department of Finance, but, in terms of radical change, there really is none.  In terms of redistributing the load on the taxpayer with the concept of introducing some degree of equity this is a cautious and conservative &mdash; with a small &ldquo;c&rdquo;&mdash; budget.</P>
    <P>The budget fails two tests.  It fails the test of leadership, leadership which I expected from a Minister for Finance not only providing his first budget but who might be a contestant for another post if it becomes vacant &mdash; the judges are still out on that matter.  The budget does not provide leadership.  Nowhere in the budget is there a sense of what Fianna Fáil want for this country, what they can deliver or of what they hope for this country.  One can hear the echoes of the drums of the Progressive Democrats looking for the simplification of two tax rates which they have now got.  When one looks at all the other clawbacks there, this simplification of two tax rates will take more money from the pockets of the people who voted for Progressive Democrats, who thought that the Progressive Democrats were for tax reform, because in everybody's mind tax reform is confused with tax reduction.  This will not reduce the tax load on the taxpayer; it will increase it in many cases.  For many people who still do not have the assets of property which are substantially financed by mortgage income tax relief, they will be paying at the point of cash more for some of the services and luxuries they <Col N="437" /> consider to be essential than they paid before this budget was introduced.</P>
    <P>Leadership is absent in the major area of employment.  Once upon a time Fianna Fáil were good in this area and had a reputation.  They were considered to be capable of making radical changes and of taking radical risks in employment creation.  Nowhere in the Minister's long speech is there a glimmer of hope for the 300,000 people who are unemployed tonight and tomorrow when they look at the analysis of this budget they will not see any prospect of employment next week, next month or the end of the year. That is the real failure.  There is no leadership, there is no hope and there are no job creation policies built into this.</P>

      <P>This is an election budget.  The election it is designed to influence is not the next general election but the election to replace Deputy Haughey as leader of Fianna Fáil.  It is cleverly constructed and cutely drafted. It is designed to give the impression of a lot of activity, a lot of change and a lot of reform, but when the initial excitement is over and people have a chance to examine the small print, and when the Finance Bill is published, they will realise that little has changed and that the vast majority of people are no better off than before.</P>
      <P>This budget has been prepared against the background of the continuing soap opera about the Fianna Fáil leadership. At a time when the focus of public, political and media attention should be on the vital economic decisions which have to be made if we are to turn the country around, the preoccupation instead has been with the Fianna Fáil beauty contest. Will he really go this time?  Will Bertie run?  Will Albert make it?  Will Brian back Mary?  The danger is that Fianna Fáil are so desperate that they might even turn to Michael O'Kennedy and then we will all have to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are far more important questions facing the country.  What is to be done about unemployment?  When will those dependent on social welfare get a decent income?  Why, more than ten <Col N="438" /> years after the massive tax marches, are the PAYE sector still paying 90 per cent of all income tax?</P>
    <P>Predictably, all the indications are that irrespective of the outcome of the Fianna Fáil leadership struggle, there will be no change in policy, and the new party leader and Taoiseach &mdash; whoever he or she may be &mdash; will still cling to the old discredited policies which have left the country in such a social, political and economic mess.</P>
    <P>The budget is the one occasion that the Government choose to present new economic policies.  If it does nothing, the Government are a failure.  This budget is not about job creation or wealth creation. There are a few concessions here and a few clawbacks there, some welcome reforms here, some imaginative development there, but no real no fundamental change.</P>
    <P>In our pre-budget proposals The Workers' Party demanded that this year's budget must give absolute priority to increasing employment and reducing poverty.  This, we said, would mean taking new and imaginative steps on job creation, improving the living standards for those depending on social welfare, honouring national commitments made to employees and to society as a whole, and raising additional taxes from those who are not paying their fair share. Judged aginst these criteria, Deputy Ahern's first budget has to be judged a failure on almost every count.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is the budget more disappointing than in its utter failure to come up with any significant proposals to deal with unemployment.  The Minister correctly identified unemployment as the single biggest social problem facing the country, and at least, unlike his predecessor last year, talked about the problem, but he had nothing to offer the unemployed.  He spoke at some length about the proposed new employment and training schemes, but this is at least the third time on which this scheme has been announced.  It was announced at the Cáirde Fáil dinner on 28 November, it was reannounced by him to the Dáil on 17 December and is reannounced again <Col N="439" /> today.  The most telling point about this scheme is that it does not involve the expenditure of a single extra penny by the Government on job creation.  Of course, we must acknowledge that this scheme is not about job creation.  It is designed to take people off the live register rather than put people into productive employment.</P>
    <P>This budget, like all budgets in the last ten years failed to tackle the tax dodgers. There were certainly a number of welcome changes announced by the Minister, but these dealt with smaller scale tax evasion rather than the massive schemes which we all know are here.  I have no doubt that the Minister will now come under intensive lobbying by the vested interests to water down the changes before the Finance Bill is published.  I also have no doubt that the tax experts and accountants and lawyers are already looking for yet more loopholes in these changes which will enable them to continue to exploit other taxpayers.  Those outside the PAYE straight jacket can play games with their accountants and use all the tax dodges that have kept their tax bills so low for so long &mdash; gifts to friends and relatives, property investments, bogus share transactions, offshore consultancies and fake business expenses. These wealthy tax tricksters still have all the devices to evade their responsibilities. They have been let off the hook again.  So much for leadership.</P>
    <P>There is one thing as certain as night follows day.  As long as this Government remain in power, the PAYE workers will end up paying for everyone.  Fianna Fáil seemed to have totally surrendered to the Progressive Democrats on taxation.  The changes announced today clearly reflect the obsession of the Progressive Democrats with tax rates alone to the virtual exclusion of other aspects of taxation. Major progress could be made towards a fair and equitable tax system by radically extending the tax bands without changing the tax rates at all.</P>
    <P>The increase in the tax threshold of about 3 per cent is a sick joke.  Those on low pay may find themselves taken out <Col N="440" /> of the tax net for a few months, but they will be back in again as soon as they get their promised increases under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The extension of the standard band was quite inadequate.  The reduction of the upper rate means that people like Mr. Michael Smurfit and Mr. Dermot Desmond will be paying tax at the same rate as workers on the average industrial wage.  The super rich in Irish society, who once paid tax at a rate of up to 80 per cent will now &mdash; when they pay tax at all &mdash; be able to pay at just 48 per cent while the Minister announces that he will also tax unemployment benefit. Those super rich will no doubt show their gratitude to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in the traditional manner, and I hope the unemployed and the sick will show their gratitude in the traditional manner as well by turfing them out of office as soon as they get the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The poor will continue to suffer too. The hidden cutbacks, emerging by the day, will bring new hardships in the increased cost of health care, education and basic services &mdash; everything from bus fares to local service charges are on the way up.  VAT increases will come into effect in March but social welfare changes will not come into operation until late July.</P>
    <P>The Minister made much of the fact that increases in social welfare will be slightly above the expected rate of inflation, but a policy of setting social welfare increases on or about the level of inflation would only be satisfactory if the basic social welfare levels were themselves adequate.  This is clearly not the case.  Even with the additional provision for those most in need, the increase for many people on the lowest level of social welfare will be no more than £3 per week. People will still be expected to exist on an income of £53 per week.  Many of the most well off in society would spend as much on a single meal.</P>
    <P>This budget does nothing for the PAYE taxpayer.  It does nothing for the unemployed.  It does nothing for the poor.  It perpetuates the two-tier society. <Col N="441" /> It is the first budget of a new Minister and we might have hoped for a new departure.  He could have shown real leadership potential by beginning the process of real tax reform.  All we got was the usual Fianna Fáil shuffle.  He could have shown he was genuinely concerned about the plight of the unemployed.  All we have got is continued reliance on the climatology school of economics and the introduction of tax on social welfare benefits, unemployment benefit and disability benefit.</P>
    <P>The events of the past few months have shown that many of those at the top of Irish business have no interest in job creation, that they are far more interested in tax dodges, stratagems, offshore companies and secret share deals than in job creation.  To paraphrase the famous statement by Winston Churchill, and apply it to some of our captains of industry &mdash;&ldquo;never in the field of human endeavour have so few taken so much from so many&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our democracy will not be a true democracy until the political leadership responds to the gross inequities in our society.  Our unemployed, our young and our emigrants deserve better than bland faith in the old, failed policies.</P>
    <P>This year we will mark 70 years as an independent State.  What have we achieved after seven decades under successive Conservative Governments?  I do not choose to use the small &ldquo;c&rdquo; as Deputy Quinn did when describing the Governments we have had.  We have the highest rate of unemployment in the European Community, with those on the live register and the pre-retirement schemes amounting to more than 280,000 people. The number out of work has not been below 200,000 since the end of 1983. Between 1986 and 1991, 136,000 people emigrated.  More than 750,000 people live in some degree of poverty.  Children now make up a higher proportion of the poor than 20 years ago.  The top 20 per cent of families enjoy 44 per cent of gross income, with the bottom 20 per cent having to do with less than 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our Government are reduced to hoping that the recession in Britain and <Col N="442" /> the US will end and that emigration will resume at a substantial level, reducing unemployment and thereby the financial burden of social welfare payments.  That is the fundamental basis of Government policy but all the indications are that this is a vain hope.  The British economy is now experiencing what many economists refer to as the &ldquo;double dip&rdquo; phenomenon. In other words, there was a partial recovery but the economy is now into decline again.  In the United States last week the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the equivalent of our Central Bank, warned that there was no sign of recovery in the United States.</P>
    <P>But what is the point in being an independent State if we are going to meekly accept that we cannot do anything about our own economic problems and that we are totally dependent on policy decisions made in London and Washington? Everyone acknowledges, as I do, that in the modern world economies are to a large extent interdependent, but to argue that we cannot do anything until the British and US economies recover is to not only abandon our people but also to abandon political leadership.</P>
    <P>There are many issues on which this Government deserve to be indicted, but there is none so serious as their utter failure to deal with unemployment and their shocking indifference to the plight of those without jobs.  At a time when unemployment demands to be treated as a national emergency, it seems to merit little attention from the Government.  It hardly figured at all in the Review of the Programme for Government.  The Estimates for 1992 contained no initiatives, and, similarly, this budget is virtually a blank page.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to have thrown in the towel and opted out of the struggle against unemployment.  This Government appear to consider an average unemployment level for 1992 of 275,000 to be socially, politically, and economically acceptable.</P>
    <P>Apart from the moral and social arguments as to why we should combat unemployment, it is also very clear that there is an unanswerable economic argument <Col N="443" /> for urgent action to deal with the problem. Unemployment is penalising not just the unemployed but every citizen of the State.</P>
    <P>The burden on the economy, arising from unemployment, is now so great that there does not seem to be any way in which the economy can be restored to full health until the majority of those on the dole queues are put back into productive work.</P>
    <P>The full cost to the Exchequer of unemployment is notoriously hard to compute but from official figures it is possible to establish that the direct cost in terms of additional social welfare payments and income tax foregone is at least £2,500 million per year.</P>
    <P>To this must be added indirect losses to the State such as lower VAT and excise returns arising from the reduced purchasing power of the unemloyed, lower rent returns to local authorities because of the structure of the differential rent system, extra health costs, supplementary welfare payments and so on. We can only speculate as to the cost of these elements, but when they are taken into account, the total cost of unemployment is likely to be closer to £3,000 million per year.</P>
    <P>Shocking as these figures are, they are only part of the picture.  Of even more significance is the human and social cost &mdash; the families broken, the lives destroyed and talents wasted by the scourge of unemployment.  The abandonment of the unemployed by successive Governments is reaping a bitter harvest of poverty, crime, vandalism and social alienation.  This is especially so in urban areas, where unemployment is demoralising and destroying entire communities, while in rural Ireland it is denuding the countryside of people.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party reject the notion that such levels of unemployment can ever be accepted as the norm in our society.  Unemployment must be treated as the national disaster it is.  We must force whatever Government are in power, whatever Taoiseach is in office, to give it the priority it demands.  I am <Col N="444" /> not suggesting that solutions are easy or without cost.  I know there has to be a concerted national effort, with compromises on all sides.</P>
    <P>I would argue that there is a fundamental underlying principle which must be accepted and that is that industrial development is the key to reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>Urgent consideration must be given to how the recent report of the Industrial Policy Review Group which makes important recommendations on tax reform, education, training policies and changes in the industrial infrastructure and support system, can be implemented. Many of these are recommendations which have already been made by The Workers' Party over the years.  We welcome them and call for their early implementation.  In particular, we endorse the report's emphasis on the necessity for tax reform through the reduction of regressive reliefs and the extension of the standard rate bands and for greater and more direct support for indigenous industry through State share-holdings rather than indiscriminate grant-aiding.</P>
    <P>In The Workers' Party publication of November 1991 on the jobs crisis entitled <i>Back to Business</i> we argued that there were three vital ingredients in the solution to unemployment.  They are radical tax reform &mdash; not the cosmetic exercise engaged in here today &mdash; social welfare reform, a more relevant and active industrial policy, and a thorough democratisation of all economic, political and industrial institutions and organisations. On industrial policy we argued strongly for greater selectivity and targeting in respect of State assistance given to business. We sought a policy which would direct the development of large, successful indigenous industry, allow small enterprise to flourish and provide good standards and guidelines for businesses of all kinds.  We also advocated a much more active interventionist EC industrial policy with convergence of the regions and decentralisation of employment as major targets.  In our view, to be effective such an industrial policy must be <Col N="445" /> accompanied by the democratisation of all institutions involved, be they private companies, trade unions, local authorities, voluntary organisations or State bodies.  People must be involved at all levels of decision-making.  The empowerment of those who have been most excluded traditionally, whether for reasons of age, gender, disability, class or whatever, must be a priority.  The Workers' Party do not perceive this as an afterthought or optional extra but rather perceive the real empowerment of people at all levels of organisations as an integral part, perhaps even a pre-condition, of the kind of industrial development required here, that is, the growth of industry which can create secure, well paid jobs from socially, economically and environmentally desirable activity.</P>
    <P>Democratisation of the workplace must involve significant changes for women, including the majority who work in the home.  The next step towards equal status for women who work in the home is to ensure economic and social independence through the provision of a guaranteed minimum income for every adult individual in society.  We believe this can and should be achieved through radical reform and integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  Ours was the first party in the Dáil to promote such a concept as a means of ending poverty traps, adult dependency and redistributing both work and income within our society.  We welcome the fact that others see merit in such a mechanism and acknowledge that ways must be found to implement it during the nineties.</P>
    <P>Individualisation of social welfare payments constitutes the necessary first step towards providing independent incomes for all adults in our society.  For many years we have advocated the payment of adult dependant allowances directly to the adults concerned and contend that this simple, non-cost-increasing change, has been delayed far too long.  In our budget submission we contended that ideally these allowances should be raised to approximately 70 per cent of the amount payable to the partner of the adult concerned.  Clearly this cannot be <Col N="446" /> achieved immediately.  Nonetheless a reasonable timetable for its achievement should have been set beginning with this budget.  Like many other things, that has not been done.  However, no further delays can be tolerated in achieving the minimum social welfare payment levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986.  Updating these levels at the midway point of the £50 to £60 per week recommended implies a minimum of approximatley £64 per week for every man and woman dependent on social welfare in 1992.  The very lowest payment &mdash; now at £50 per week &mdash; would need to have been increased by £14 per week.  Again that has not been done. Instead a miserly £3 per week has been added.</P>
    <P>This budget has failed our children also, those at greatest risk of poverty here today, especially when born into large, low income households headed by mothers on their own, fathers who are unemployed or parents on small farms in rural areas.  All relevant research points to the importance of child benefit as the most direct way of reducing this risk. Indeed I might add that child benefit here remains at about the lowest level within the European Community and should have been almost doubled.  We contend it should be at least £30 per month per child and £40 per month for the fourth and subsequent children.  Ideally it should be graduated according to the age of the child or young person, corresponding to three-quarters of the minimum social welfare payment.  This budget does nothing except apply an inflation-related increase to child benefit. There is nothing in this budget to ensure that our children, those at greatest risk of poverty, can be prevented from living lives of misery.</P>
    <P>The budget fails to acknowledge the enormous contribution of people, mostly women, who care for elderly, infirm relatives. In 1990 The Workers' Party welcomed the introduction of a carer's allowance, something for which we had long campaigned.  We pointed out that the allowance then being introduced was seriously flawed and would not serve to <Col N="447" /> provide adequate protection for all carers.  In 1991 we said that the level of payment should be increased from its then level of £45 per week to £55 per week and upwards to £62, bringing it into line with the recommended minimum for other rates advocated by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Other rates now stand at approximately £64 per week while the carer's allowance remains at £50 only. Again carers will receive the miserly inflation-related £3 increase which, in our view should have been increased to at least £57 per week this year and further next year.</P>
    <P>We sought other changes in the carer's allowance which have not yet been implemented, such as the removal of the means test, contending that the allowance should be paid irrespective of the income of the person receiving care or of the carer's spouse; alteration of the requirement to provide full-time care and attention should be effected to allow greater flexibility in the forms of care provided.  We also advocated allowing carers to receive credited PRSI contributions to maintain their health and social insurance cover.  There appears to be no intention on the part of this Government to address this issue.  We must remember that this State is saved millions of pounds by carers who look after elderly and/or infirm relatives.  Yet we give them this miserly amount of money, means tested out of existence, which is so restrictive the vast majority cannot benefit from it.  We must either provide proper support for people who look after relatives in this manner or cough up the money to provide for institutional care, which would be much more expensive than effecting the kind of reforms I am proposing.</P>
    <P>The Government owe money to thousands of women who were in receipt of certain social welfare payments in 1984 to 1986.  Those payments should have been increased in accordance with an EC equality directive but were delayed for 17 months with no retrospection ever being paid.  Since then the Government have made various attempts, through the <Col N="448" /> courts, to avoid payment of these moneys, the last of such attempts having failed in March and July 1991, respectively, when the European Court of Justice gave two unequivocal rulings against this State.  The moneys due have not been paid to date.  The Minister said today they would be paid in some kind of phased way, details of which are not yet available to us.  This is a disgraceful way to treat women entitled to those increases at the time.  Indeed I might suggest that they seek the interest which would have accrued to them in having allowed the Government withhold those moneys for so long.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the matter of tax reform.  There is little doubt that the case for fundamental tax reform is as pressing today as it was when The Workers' Party and others initiated the tax protests of the late seventies.  The worthy reports of the Commission on Taxation have been the subject to great academic investigation. Meanwhile the overwhelming burden of taxation continues to be borne by the PAYE sector.  The system is still characterised by widespread avoidance and evasion, tax breaks for the self-employed and corporate sectors, a bias in favour of capital and high marginal tax rates for employees on low levels of income.  The inequitable distribution of the direct tax burden is compounded by the high level of indirect taxation borne disproportionately by those on low incomes.  We have witnessed today the 12.5 per cent VAT rate being increased to 16 per cent, imposing yet another burden on those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Rate reductions on their own, as announced today by the Minister, do not constitute a reform of the taxation system.  As I said the increase in the exemption limits will be wiped out as soon as workers receive their <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increases.  Real reform must involve a redistribution of the tax burden away from the PAYE sector to the self-employed and the corporate sectors.  This requires a real commitment to tackling tax evasion and eliminating the plethora of reliefs and exemptions which reduce <Col N="449" /> the tax base.  It also means ensuring the progressivity of the tax allowances and rate structures which the Government and the budget have failed to do today.</P>
    <P>Instead, it goes for the Progressive Democrats solution which benefits high income earners at the expense of low income earners.  In our view we should have moved to a three-tier rate structure with a 25 per cent standard rate and higher rates of 40 per cent and 60 per cent, to substantially increase the exemption limits to take lower paid workers outside the tax net and to widen the standard rate band to avoid high marginal tax rates at modest levels of income.  We should have moved to replace all personal tax allowances with tax credits, to freeze, with a view to eventually eliminating, the reliefs for covenants, business expansion schemes, non-mortgage interest and a whole range of other reliefs that should have been eliminated.  We should have moved also to restrict the mortgage interest relief to the standard rate and eliminate the anomaly whereby a person working can get mortgage relief but when a person becomes unemployed they get no relief, they have to beg the community welfare officer to try to get a £5 note to help pay off a mortgage of something like £200 or £300 per month. That kind of mortgage relief should be converted into a housing subsidy which would enable people in all categories &mdash; whether working or unemployed &mdash; to be able to keep a roof over their head.  We should have moved also to index link all PAYE allowances and credits, assuming that credits had been introduced.</P>
    <P>On the question of corporation tax the Minister should have introduced a minimum corporation tax charge based on commercial profits and replaced reliefs, exemptions and so on with direct grants related to the levels of employment generated.</P>
    <P>On the question of capital gains tax and capital taxes generally, the Minister has fiddled around the capital gains tax but he should have generally reduced the various reliefs and exemptions in both capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.  He should have gone for the taxation <Col N="450" /> of capital gains, gifts and inheritances of income at income tax rates and could have spread it over a number of years. He should have gone for the imposition of stamp duty at the full rate on transfer of shares in property companies and the imposition of capital tax on shares issued in unlimited companies.  He did not do those things but instead fiddled around at the edges and pretended to give the impression he was engaged in trying to broaden the tax base when, in fact, he was doing nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>The area of tax evasion and avoidance remains a major scandal which successive Governments have shown an inexplicable reluctance to tackle.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, published last November, illustrated the extent of the problem when it disclosed that there was £2,718 million outstanding in uncollected taxes but that only about £426 million was likely to be collected. Why is that and what is the Minister doing about changing that situation?  The same report revealed that four out of five income tax earners audited under the new self-assessment system, were found to be liable to additional taxation of an average of £11,000 each.  What is even more alarming is that less than 1 per cent of those making self-assessed returns had been subjected to an audit.  Dodgers probably have a far better chance of getting away with not paying their fair share than those people who buy their lottery tickets every week have of winning a few pounds on the lottery.</P>
    <P>Every pound in tax evaded by business or the self-employed is a pound out of the pockets of PAYE workers or out of the pockets of the poor, the unemployed or those starving in the Third World. Despite the 1988 tax amnesty, which brought in £600 million, the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General shows tht evasion continues on a massive scale. It was admitted today by the Minister that that is the case although he refuses to bring in any significant changes to rectify that.</P>
    <P>One area that could have been looked at immediately is the question of staffing <Col N="451" /> in the Revenue Commissioners.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that he intends to move the customs and excise staff, who will become surplus to requirements when the 1992 barriers fall, to the Revenue Commissioners.  I hope a significant number of them will be used at the investigative end of the Revenue Commissioners because there is much to be done in that area.</P>
    <P>This budget should have extended the withholding tax system currently applying to sub-contractors and professionals to other sectors such as farming but the Minister failed to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem with that at the moment, the money is not there in most instances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We will wait and see.  The series of financial scandals which came to light during the past six months have highlighted the use of offshore companies to avoid the scrutiny of our company legislation and for tax evasion purposes.  To tackle this the Minister should have introduced controlled foreign company legislation to tax offshore investment companies owned or controlled by Irish nationals but he did not do that.  In addition we should seek greater EC-wide co-operation on the exchange of information regarding nonresident bank accounts, investments and capital flows.  There is no indication that he intends to do that.</P>
      <P>There are other things he did not bother to do.  The housing crisis worsened significantly in 1991.  In Dublin alone some 5,000 people are on the housing list.  It is now nearly one year since new proposals for social housing were launched following one of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> undertakings but to date the infrastructure which is needed to make these proposals effective has not been put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing Bill promised last autumn has not yet appeared.  Dublin Corporation have launched a pilot project for shared ownership of some 150 houses <Col N="452" /> in accordance with the proposals and in advance of the legislation but it is far from clear how people on the housing list will finance such purchases and what the ultimate costs will be to those involved or how the bulk of those 5,000 people will fare in 1992.</P>
    <P>The budget should have allocated realistic funds for social housing if this concept and the various <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitments are not to become a sad and discredited joke.  It should also have scrapped the existing tax incentives for urban renewal, whose main effects have been to create surplus city centre office space and provide tax shelters for developers and well off investors and provide instead grant aid schemes for renewal of cities and their suburbs and provide proper town planning.</P>
    <P>The budget should have replaced these misdirected tax shelters with flat rate subsidies for people who want to buy inner city residential property or to service providers to move into abandoned neighbourhood centres.  There is one in Ballymun and a number of others in Finglas which could do with an injection of funds to encourage people to take over the shops which are lying vacant, thus creating major problems for the communities. Ballymun and Finglas are not alone in this; this is a problem throughout the country.  The existing urban renewal schemes are not tackling that problem.  It is time a new look was taken at how that can be done.</P>
    <P>In relation to the health services, there has been consistent under-funding and the services continue to diminish in terms of the quality of care available to those in need.  Many health boards faced appalling difficulties maintaining services during 1991 and these problems will intensify this year if funds are not increased again.  There have been cutbacks in services and increases in charges without a great deal of media or public attention.  The increase in daily hospital charges to £15, announced in December, represented an increase of 50 per cent in 12 months; the change in the drugs refund scheme, announced in October, was a <Col N="453" /> particularly mean and underhand cutback. As recently as 1983 all expenditure on drugs above £16 per month was refundable.  Now, a patient who spends up to £90 per quarter may get no refund at all.  The system should be changed so that refunds are again made on a monthly basis and the amount should be increased to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>People with a mental handicap and their families are among those who have suffered most as a result of the Government's failure to provide adequate resources for the health services and in the planning area.  We fully support the call made by the Parents Association of People with a Mental Handicap, for a commitment over a five year period to an extra £22.5 million on capital spending and a phased increase in current spending to reach an extra £27.5 million on services. No serious attempt, however, has been made in this budget to deal with that matter &mdash; just a few pounds here and a few pounds there.</P>
    <P>There is no planning in this area of crucial need and demand.  The Government are ignoring the misery of thousands of families who are struggling to keep men and women with a mental handicap at home.  They simply cannot manage because of old age and they are literally afraid to die because they do not know what will happen to their unfortunate children given that there is no residential accommodation available for them.  It is time the Government did something about this problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to deal with the question of development aid.  There is no doubt in my mind &mdash; and I have been arguing about this for a long time &mdash; that there is a radical need to overhaul our development aid policy to enable Ireland contribute usefully to the needs of developing countries.  The urgency of the situation facing developing countries cannot be under-estimated.  At least 30 million people face the threat of starvation from famine alone in Africa.  The Workers' Party welcomed the commitment given in the revised Programme for Government to achieve a higher contribution in overseas development aid by <Col N="454" /> the end of the 1992-94 period.  The Estimates announced last December proved to be an empty promise and, unfortunately, this budget proves it is still an empty promise.</P>
    <P>The primary requirement of a development aid policy is that it be backed by adequate funding.  Overseas development aid levels, therefore, should be brought up to the United Nations recommended level of 0.7 per cent of GNP on a planned basis.  Given the extent of the crisis currently facing the developing world this target should be phased in over a five year period from 1992 to 1996. Additional funding of £30 million annually would be required to achieve this target, rising to an additional £47 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial sum and I do not make any bones about it but it should be compared with the Government's request for funding of £6,000 million for the next phase of European Community Structural Funds to be allocated to Ireland.  Whatever our problems, and they are monumental, they fade into nothing when compared with those of the Third World.  Furhermore, the ESRI projections suggest a 38 per cent growth in Irish GNP between 1991 and 1996 which reduces the impact of the increases on budgetary planning.</P>
    <P>Funding should have been provided also to re-establish the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation giving it an executive function related to planning and evaluation, but this has not been done.  There is much window dressing on the range of issues I have mentioned today, including ODA, poverty, social welfare, jobs and tax reform.  In relation to tax reform, there has never been a demand for tax rates to be reduced.  What people have demanded is justice and fair play and that the tax burden be shared. They have never objected to paying for education, health, or providing for those on social welfare and living in poverty, or giving assistance to the Third World. If the Minister had come into the House today and announced that he was putting <Col N="455" /> an extra penny on the tax rates &mdash; both the standard and top rates &mdash; to provide extra money for overseas development aid, or to provide proper education for our children, I am sure there would not have been a peep out of anybody and if he had announced that he was putting an extra penny on the tax rates to provide jobs, I am sure there would have been a cheer in the House, but no, this Government went for the easy option; they decided to follow the Progressive Democrats, cut the rates and pretend they were dealing with tax reform at a time when all these social, economic and political problems continue to fester and boil.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, this budget is a disgrace.  It has dodged the real issues and failed to give any leadership.  We are a sad country and have waved goodbye to more than 100,000 of our young people during the past ten years.  Now they are coming home looking for jobs but we still do not have any for them.  It is time the Government admitted that they do not know what to do and left office.</P>

There will be an increase in the threshold below which the option to pay road tax on a part-year basis does not apply, from £70 to £90.  All these proposed changes will take effect from 1 April 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to thank the Taoiseach for his very full explanations.  However, I should like to raise a couple of points for the purpose of information.  In relation to the seven resolutions grouped together, will the Taoiseach say what the individual estimated yield or loss will be to the Exchequer in relation to each one?  If it is of significance, will the Taoiseach indicate whether there is an increase or a decrease in the consumer price index? I am not interested in small amounts. Will there be any significant increase across the range of goods?</P>
      <P>With regard to tobacco products, will the Taoiseach indicate in the first instance what, on a straight line basis, an increase of 1p on a packet of 20 cigarettes will yield and what it will yield on a multiple of 16p?  What is being allowed for diminishing returns?  I presume it is intended on the face of it to reduce the practice of smoking by putting on this increase. Have the Government taken the effect of the increase on the tobacco industry into account?  For example, have they taken the advice of a company?  Has there been any indication in the regular discussions which the company in Dundalk have with the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the loss of jobs which will ensue from a reduction in the practice of smoking, which seems to be the intention of the Government who based their case for this increase on health grounds? There is no point in one basing one's case on health grounds unless the practice of smoking is reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach to <Col N="468" /> agree to dedicate the proceeds of this tax to the health services.  It seems there is a logic in putting extra excise on items like tobacco and cigarettes which are injurious to health.  However, it logically follows that the revenue which derives from that should be dedicated, for example, to shortening the enormous waiting lists for elective surgery in our hospitals.  I should like to hear the Taoiseach's views on why he believes the yield should be rolled into general Exchequer funding and why, even though it is justified on health grounds no attempt is being made to dedicate the proceeds of this increase to the improvement of health here.</P>
    <P>Financial Resolution No. 2 deals with a minor item and all I need to know is the yield.  Financial Resolutions Nos. 3 and 4 also deal with minor items and I do not see much loss to the Exchequer.  They tidy up proposals which were made in the past.  The removal of this excise over time is being done at the request of the trade rather than for any reasons of loss of revenue.</P>
    <P>A number of questions arise from the reduction of excise on petrol.  Is any attempt being made to differentiate between the excise on unleaded petrol and the excise on leaded petrol in this reduction?  What will the cross effect on VAT be and will there be a parallel VAT decrease?  Will this reduction apply also to diesel?  In terms of fuel being environmentally friendly, I understand that diesel is a cleaner fuel than unleaded petrol and a vastly cleaner fuel than leaded petrol.  If we were to follow the trend of previous budgets, there is a case in logic for reducing the imposition on diesel.  The Minister mentioned a figure of 9p on a gallon of petrol but will there be a <i>pro rata</i> decrease for diesel?</P>
    <P>With regard to road tax, I should like the Taoiseach, apart from stating the reasons for the incrase of 20 per cent and the ceiling of £800 on vehicles over 3000 cc, to give the range across the different powers of cars so that we can familiarise ourselves with the present schedule of road tax and the new schedule of road tax.  In the case of vehicles which are used by people in business, for example, vans <Col N="469" /> and landrovers which were free from excise up to now because they were used for commercial purposes, will he explain what the imposition actually is, given the yield and state if there are any exemptions? I presume the measure is being introduced because in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners there was widespread abuse and people were using an exemption for the business community to buy small vehicles for private purposes. Is any exemption now available as a result of this measure to the business community who genuinely drive from their small country shops to the cash and carry on their half day and take the goods home with them?</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if any progress has been made in Europe on the harmonisation of excise on motor vehicles?  Will the first registration fee announced by the Minister in lieu of excise duty be at a fixed agreed yield and not subject to subsequent moves towards harmonisation?  To put it more simply, is it now the position that all attempts to harmonise excise on motor vehicles in Europe have ended and is it being left to individual Governments simply to introduce a first time registration fee which would yield the same amount as the present excise duty and that there would be no necessity, because it is a national first registration fee, to proceed down the road towards harmonisation of excise duty?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my appreciation at the way the Whips have tried to organise the debate this evening. I will try to be a concise as is conducive to good discussion and debate.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody can seriously argue with the tobacco provisions in the budget.  As one who from time to time smokes a cigar, I think the case has been well met and I do not think there is any public disappointment with that.  It will obviously hurt some people but it is designed in a way that nobody could seriously argue with it, and we certainly do not propose to so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the price of cider and perry because, many teenage <Col N="470" /> cider drinkers are alcohol abusers.  If market mechanisms make it less easy for people to acquire such products, then this is to be welcomed.  Harmonisation of duties makes a certain amount of sense when one takes into account the fact that cider, like beer, is an alcoholic drink. Unfortunately I do not think this increase will make a lot of difference in terms of the difficulties that are caused by the illegal sale of cider.  I would like to think that some of the additional revenue &mdash; perhaps the Taoiseach, in is capacity as stand in for the Minister for Finance, can tell us what the additional yield will be &mdash; would be used to intensify efforts to prevent the illegal sale to minors of all alcoholic drinks, of which cider is the most celebrated in its abuse.</P>
    <P>I have nothing substantial to say about the budget as it relates to televisions, videos and camcorders.  There is a certain degree of rationalisation here, but I want to devote a certain degree of attention to petrol, or hydrocarbons as it is properly identified in this proposal.  It seems a long time to the Taoiseach &mdash; it must seem like an eternity &mdash; since we celebrated the Green Presidency.  The jewel in the crown of Ireland's six month's temporary tenure of the Presidency of Europe was its green dimension, yet all rhetoric and everything that went with it, seems to have been abandoned, if not forgotten, by the gnomes of Merrion Street in that no differentiation is made &mdash; although I am subject to correction in the type of petrol that is to be reduced by 9p per gallon.  I would have thought this an ideal opportunity, particularly when reducing taxes and since we are now converted to market mechanisms, some more obviously than others, to give a premium in terms of a reduced price for unleaded petrol as against leaded petrol.  There is no reference to a differentiation between these two types of petrol in the resolution or in the Ministers statement.  This will be a great disappointment to the many people in the community who share aspirations for a better environment and for a decrease in pollution.</P>
    <P>I now turn to motor vehicles.  Some private vehicles can be converted for <Col N="471" /> commercial use.  This was identified by the motor manufacturers.  For example, the manufactured vehicles which could be used for private and commercial purpose. In order to make them commercial vehicles, the back windows were covered and, the back seats removed.  By using such vehicles for everyday use people were clearly abusing the tax laws.  Therefore, I have no problem with harmonisation in this case.  However, it seems that what is being given with the one hand is being taken with the other &mdash; fuel costs are being reduced but motor tax is being increased by Financial Resolution No. 16.</P>
    <P>Will any of the additional money from the increase in the sale price of cider and perry be made to the authorities to combat the illegal sales of alcohol to underage persons?  Can the Taoiseach explain why the Government, if we pass this resolution tonight, still have the power without reference back to the Oireachtas to introduce a differential between leaded and unleaded petrol?  In other words, do the Government have the executive administrative discretion to set a price differential between leaded and uleaded petrol after we vote tonight or must we attempt to amend this measure?  Would the Taoiseach clarify the position in relation to the tax yield from road tax?  How much additional money will accrue from the increase in road tax and what will be the cost of the reduction in petrol?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody can argue with the increase in the excise on tobacco or cider and perry, although I doubt whether these increases will have the desired effect or whether, continuing to increase the excise, it will have the effect of dissuading people from smoking or from buying cider.  Very often underage people buy cider, and I say that with regret.  It is probably more honest to say that these are fairly easy targets for raising revenue.  I am sure many people will welcome the abolition of excise on televisions, videos and camcorders but they will wonder at the fact that while VAT is <Col N="472" /> abolished on those items it is increased in items which would be considered more essential.</P>
      <P>I want to concentrate on the hydrocarbons issue.  I was surprised at the manner in which this proposal has been put forward.  I recall that during the Green Presidency to which Deputy Quinn referred great play was made about the additional reduction in the excise duty on unleaded petrol which, it was claimed, would have the effect of encouraging more people to switch over to unleaded petrol.  It is fair to say that, through the reduced price of unleaded petrol and because of the increased awareness by the public of the desirability of not using leaded petrol, there has been a very significant increase in the use of unleaded petrol and a decrease in the use of leaded petrol.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the opportunity which presented itself of a fairly significant reduction in the excise on petrol was not availed of in a way which would have given an even greater incentive to the public to switch over to unleaded petrol.  For example, I would have thought that if it was decided not to reduce the price of leaded petrol, but to reduce the price of unleaded petrol it might have the effect of encouraging more people in a very decisive way to switch over to unleaded petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at this move for another reason.  Lest the thrust of the Green Presidency be forgotten entirely after Ireland's term of Presidency, there is in the European Community increased discussion about the idea of introducing carbon taxes.  The European Community is examining the &ldquo;Greenhouse&rdquo; effect on the world environment and is preparing for a world environmental conference in South America next year, where no doubt we will be represented and the Government will contribute to the many fine declarations on reducing CO2 emissions. At a time when there is discussion on the use of carbon taxes as a means of discouraging people from polluting the atmosphere, it is strange that we should introduce a proposal that will have the effect of reducing a carbon tax in a way <Col N="473" /> that does not distinguish between the use of leaded and unleaded petrol.  I join with Deputy Quinn in asking the Taoiseach to indicate whether there may be some way in which that distinction can be made even at this late stage.  The policy adopted previously of trying to provide an incentive for people to switch over to using unleaded petrol should be continued and encouraged.</P>

      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming the increase in the excise duty on tobacco and cider.  I hope it will act as a deterrent and prevent many young people abusing tobacco and cider.  However, if that is the purpose of the increase, it should be accompanied by a better educational programme.</P>
      <P>I should like to address the increase in road tax.  It is ironic that the Government who removed road tax in 1977, are now a party in Government who have introduced this cruel hike.  To increase road tax by 20 per cent is farcical, especially when one considers the condition of the roads in rural Ireland.  The rural population must cope with the worst roads in Europe.  Indeed a recent report states that only 400 miles of the 2,400 miles of county roads in Kerry are up to standard. That is unfair and I find it totally objectionable. It would be one thing if this money was invested in county roads or in roads in the counties from which it was taken.</P>

      <P>This cruel imposition will be resisted by rural people.  If the Government are serious about doing something for rural Ireland they should consider the motorists.  The Taoiseach is aware of the importance of a car in rural Ireland.  Young people, in particular, will not be able to afford the additional 20 per cent increase in motor tax because they are being hit already with the highest insurance premiums in Europe in addition to the high cost of secondhand cars.  If the Government had any consideration for people in rural Ireland they would have reduced motor tax by a reasonable amount instead of imposing this penal hike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I differ with some of my colleagues in their approach to the increase of 16p. on a package of 20 cigarettes. I heard a titter in the House today when it was mentioned that the increase in excise on cigarettes and tobacco was for health reasons.  We should be honest and say that this increase will raise money to pay for the concessions in the budget. The increase may have the effect also of turning some people off smoking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a means of raising money to pay for the concessions in the budget.  If the increase was an effort to stop people smoking, why did we not impose a similar increase on alcohol. Many alcoholics do not drink cider and perry, they drink whiskey and beer. Indeed if the Minister for Finance felt that an increase in excise would improve health, he could have put £1 on the pint. The increase in the price of cigarettes will cause hardship to people who find it difficult to give up smoking.  In some houses up to three people smoke.  For some people on low incomes, smoking is unfortunately the only pleasure left to them.  The point should be made that this imposition is to raise money.  I take the point made by Deputy Noonan that if we want to improve health, we should fund the health services properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> With the range of television channels available people may watch channels that carry tobacco advertisements at sporting events throughout the world.  Tobacco companies sponsor sporting events and smoking is connected with what would otherwise be regarded as healthy sports. The tobacco companies have diverted the money they cannot spend on television advertising to advertising in areas where young people congregate.  It would be helpful if an educational programme was introduced in schools before young people get hooked on smoking.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with raising money for social welfare by imposing 16p. on a packet of 20 cigarettes.  However, the Government should come clean and not say they are imposing the increase for health reasons.  If that is the reason the Government should, in conjunction with the health boards, spend more money on banning advertising that encourages young people to smoke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on increasing the duty on cigarettes; he has not increased it sufficiently.  Perhaps in 20 or 30 years time people will not smoke.  It is a most obnoxious habit which is bad for people's health.  The banning of smoking would be counter productive because people would find a way around it.  I agree with Deputy Kavanagh that it is an absolute scandal that tobacco companies are allowed advertise. All tobacco advertising should cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not comment on Resolutions Nos. 2, 3 and 4.  However, I have considerable difficulty with Resolution No. 5 on hydrocarbons.  Deputies Gilmore and Quinn referred to the need to introduce a carbon tax.  This is very necessary and it will be imposed by the EC in the next year or so.  Something will have to be done to conserve our dwindling resources of fossil fuels and at the same time reduce pollution.  The Minister made some excuses for the reduction in the price of a gallon of petrol.  He mentioned cross-Border trade and I accept that is a factor but he did not produce the figures to show <Col N="476" /> its effect on tourism.  I know it is a difficult question but petrol has been dropping in price in the past few weeks and people have noticed that each time they fill the tank the price is 50p or 20p less than previously.  The Minister has given a very inadequate reason for the reduction in petrol prices; I should have thought that he would increase them.  Depending on the Minister's reply, I would have very serious difficulty in supporting Resolution No. 5.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section on motor vehicles, Financial Resolution No. 6, I should certainly go along with the proposed 12.5 per cent increase for so-called vans.  We all realise that the practice that has been going on is quite a racket.  I accept that the reduction of excise duty on smaller cars is another effort to differentiate between the gas guzzlers &mdash; the 2.5 litre and the 3 litre plus cars &mdash; and other cars.  That is a gesture in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's response, particularly in relation to Financial Resolution No. 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputy who spoke earlier, I do not smoke, but many people, despite reminders on cigarette packets that cigarettes damage one's health, continue to smoke.  It is wrong to increase the price by 16 pence and say that is to deter people from smoking for the good of their health.  I agree with the Deputy who said that the measure was really an exercise to raise revenue.  Most Governments would shudder if everyone gave up cigarettes completely because that would constitute a tremendous loss in revenue.  The argument put forward could also be applied to alcoholic consumption.  The price of a pint is to be increased by a few pence, but we all know that excessive drinking can also lead to health risks.  However, in relation to alcohol I do not ever hear people say that drink should be cut out or its consumption should be moderated by the Government because it is a health risk and often leads to rather serious complaints. I therefore support the Deputy <Col N="477" /> who spoke previously.  I consider the increase of 16 pence on cigarettes to be excessive.</P>
      <P>Reducing the price of petrol by 9 pence a gallon is a worthwhile decision and if it helps to reconcile the differential between ourselves and those across the Border, so much the better.  Tourists who come to this country often complain about the price of petrol.  I am glad that positive movements have been made in that direction in recent times and the 9p reduction in the budget will enhance that movement.</P>
      <P>I feel that a 20 per cent increase in road tax for cars is dramatic.  In the heady days of 1977 the Taoiseach's predecessor actually abolished road tax.  We have changed dramatically from those days. When road taxes were abolished in 1977 everyone with a Honda voted for Fianna Fáil because they did not need to pay road tax, but now the tax is going up in massive leaps.  While I should not like to deal with the matter at length because it concerns another issue, Deputy Deenihan was quite right when he said that it is very hard to tell the hard-pressed motorist that the road tax is to be increased by 20 per cent when already motorists express criticism to their county councillors about the condition of the roads and say that if they had their way they would not pay any road tax.  There will certainly be criticism of the Government's decision to go for such an excessive increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on Financial Resolution No. 2, which concerns cider and perry.  I did not intend to speak on this subject because there is much misunderstanding throughout the country about cider.  I know that there is a view, perpetrated by the news media and other people, that somehow or other cider is a dangerous drink and is used to excess by young people.  That view is not correct.  Cider is a very specialised drink and is used by a certain category of people at a particular time of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An excellent company in the South Tipperary constituency, the Showerings Bulmer enterprise, was last week <Col N="478" /> awarded a certificate by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for being one of only 30 companies in Ireland to achieve the status of the ISO, 9002.  The company employs more than 400 people in the production of a drink that comes from apples and other natural produce.  I am afraid that that drink is being put into a category in which it will have to compete with the glamour of beer drinking.  I am worried that the company will not be able to survive and could have difficulties in maintaining their workforce if cider is treated in the same way as beer.</P>
    <P>Showerings Bulmer take a very responsible attitude towards the criticism extended in the news media about the drinking of cider.  It is easy for the news media to say that youths get into trouble at cider parties.  However not one cider container was ever found at the scene of a cider party when any of those incidents were investigated, but innumerable containers of different beers were found at those sites.  Showerings Bulmer has spent a lot of money on the production of a video which is used responsibly in schools to ensure that young people are made aware of the danger of over-drinking not only their own product but all alcoholic drinks.</P>
    <P>It is most unfair to single out a specific product that has a limited market but has still managed to survive in very difficult times because of its excellence and because of its historical connection with apple growing in South Tipperary and other parts of Munster.  I caution the Taoiseach and the Government that they may be treading on dangerous ground in merely lumping cider in with other products and treating it as another alcoholic drink that is abused.  In my opinion, it is not, and although I agree with my party spokesperson about rationalisation of taxation in that area, we should always treat like with like, and in this instance a particular product is being treated unfairly.  I have said that in the past in relation to this subject and it is appropriate for me to say it again now. If I did not, I would not be responsible nor would I represent the views of many people in my constituency, people who <Col N="479" /> understand the product and know when and how it is used and why it should be used properly.</P>
    <P>I should like to make passing reference to the motor vehicle changes.  While any reduction in excise duties on the importation of cars is to be welcomed, it is a pity that whatever good has arisen from that will be eliminated by the 20 per cent increase in road tax.  Many working people can never aspire to ownership of a £12,000 car in order to benefit from the reduction in VAT, but many people going to work in reasonably good old cars still have to pay the 20 per cent increase in road tax.  The cost is significant when taken against the wages those people earn and the opportunities they have, limited as they are, to travel to work.  We should have concern for those factors when we are trying to assist people to be as mobile as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would concur with the Deputy on the aspect of brevity. The debate must conclude at 9.40 p.m., and I am sure that the House would wish the Taoiseach to respond to the many queries that have been put to him regarding the Financial Resolutions.  There are other Members seeking the opportunity to speak, so brevity must be the keynote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  No one has referred to the sleight of hand involved in the commitment to abolish excise duty on motor vehicles.  Such was the expectation of the people when the merits of the Single Market were being bruited about.  In the absence of Gay Byrne, a good friend of the Taoiseach, being available to tell the people about this, it should be highlighted that when the Single Market was being sold to the people they were led to expect that one thing from which they would benefit was the importation of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have what is a feature of budgets generally, the endless capacity of the servants of the Minister for Finance to <Col N="480" /> devise a budget that seems to give away concessions with one hand but claw them back with the other.  When the people hear that the Minister is obliged to abolish the initial excise taxes, but that he proposes to introduce a first time registration fee, they will know that this is classic sleight of hand and that no benefit will accrue to people who have long been punished by excessive excise taxes in this area.</P>
    <P>Because of the state of the motor industry the Minister proposes minimal remedial interim arrangements whereby on his own calculation there will be a benefit of some £300 to somebody buying a new car at a market value of £12,000. That, coupled with the 20 per cent increase in road tax which is excessive and unjustifiable, will be a great disappointment to many people.  As Deputy Finucane remarked, it shows that we have come the full circle since 1977 when an election was won on the abolition of the road tax, one of the elements of the election package at that time.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how anyone can make a rational argument to oppose the increased duty on tobacco, but there is an inescapable truth in what Deputy Kavanagh said.  There is no doubt that working class people will be impacted on most severely as a result of this increase. Employment will also be impacted on in Dundalk for example.  When the anti-smoking campaign was first embarked upon, we were promised replacement industries for the gradually diminishing tobacco industry.  Steps have not been taken to provide those replacement industries.  On health grounds I am convinced of the merits of this tax but as Deputy Kavanagh said the truth is that it is a revenue gathering exercise which will impact very severely on working class people who are addicted to this life killing drug but who will not be weaned from it as a result of it being made more expensive. It will merely impact on their disposable income.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Ferris's remarks with regard to cider.  The Minister is behind the times.  The volume <Col N="481" /> of cider being consumed by young people is on the decline.  In any bar there is a complete range of powerful lagers on sale costing £2 per bottle and more.  It is these lagers to which young people are now turning.  Cider has been singled out here perhaps as a sop to our failure to deal with the drift of young people into excessive alcohol consumption.</P>
      <P>There has to be a limit on the price of tobacco and cigarettes.  Every health conscious person will agree with the Minister but the consequences of such a tax in working class areas is that people will buy more lottery tickets in the hope of making a big kill.  A further consequence will be the glamorisation of tobacco and smoking.  Tobacco companies have always been successful in attracting new customers by advertising, associating tobacco with major sporting events and they will continue to do that. While smoking may be prohibited its prohibition will have the effect of glamorising it.</P>

There are always ways of getting a product.  The Minister should make a decision whether <Col N="483" /> he wants to ban cigarettes because they are a danger to health or if he just wants to collect money.  What the Minister is doing now is collecting money from many people who are unemployed, who increasingly smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol and take other drugs.

      <P>I refer to the 20 per cent increase in road tax.  It is a very difficult pill for hard-presssed motorists to swallow, particularly in areas like County Mayo where the county roads have deteriorated to such an extent that it is hardly possible to travel along some of them in a motor car.  In some parts of Connemara where the roads are particularly bad people cannot take their cars up side roads, so they must park them and walk to their houses.  In some cases priests, doctors and essential services to old people have to be cut out entirely because of the impassable state of the roads.  An increase of 20 per cent in road tax is not acceptable to people who have to endure these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can any system be devised whereby road tax collected in a county could be retained there for the repair and upkeep of county roads?  All EC grants are used for national primary and national secondary roads and bypasses.  The county roads are being neglected because county councils are not adequately funded. People might have a lesser objection to an increase of 20 per cent in road tax if there was a possibility that the money would be retained within the county to be spent on the repair and upkeep of roads in their area.  It is difficult to continue paying road tax to central funds when the central Government are not providing enough money to county councils for the repair and upkeep of roads. The Taoiseach might consider some <Col N="484" /> system which would encourage people to pay their road tax.</P>

      <P>We will let the Taoiseach go out quitely.  The average motorist will respond strongly to the increase in road tax, for the reasons outlined by Deputy McCormack.  The condition of county roads in rural Ireland is such that they are a source of constant complaint.  In many areas school buses are refusing to travel along some routes because of the condition of country roads.  The Minister for Finance might address this question. There was no mention in his speech of additional funding for roads.  People could possibly accept this increase in road tax if they could see a return in terms of spending on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously there is a choice in relation to cigarette smoking and other habits that might endanger one's health.  For many people on low incomes and many unemployed people the increased price of the packet of cigarettes will be a very severe burden.  Effectively it is probable that it <Col N="485" /> will more than wipe out any compensation in social welfare benefits.  I am not sure how serious the Minister for Health is in the advice she offered to the Minister for Finance.  The increase will be very badly received by smokers, who may well look for other options and find less expensive pastimes.  The unemployed enjoy their few cigarettes and they will be very angry at what must be the largest increase for many years.  In the past there was some outcry at increases of 3p or 4p but this increase will be very badly received.</P>

The grouping together of these resolutions might indicate that in future the Department of Finance will group these areas together to give one yield.  On the one hand they are concentrating on the green effect while on the other hand there are penalties on rural people.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister for Finance has deemed it necessary to increase excise duty on cider.  I speak with first-hand experience of the industry since Bulmers Showerings are located in Clonmel.  Like my constituency colleague, Deputy Ferris, I was there last week when they received a very prestigious prize.  They provide enormous employment in our area.  The industry is environmentally friendly.  The firm are very efficient and they treat their employees extremely well.  They have been very beneficial to our local economy in that they continue to increase the numbers employed and employ local people. Much of their raw material is bought locally, providing futher employment</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently representatives from the cider industry made a submission to the Committee on Crime and they buried the myth that cider is the root of all evil. They presented us with very convincing statistics indicating that the consumption <Col N="486" /> of cider by young people is not as extensive as we are led to believe.  The cider industry are very often blamed in the wrong.  They are responsible as an industry in that on a monthly basis they circulate a news letter to schools and public bodies to ensure that their product is not abused.</P>
    <P>I fear that this increase in excise duty will have a negative effect on the industry nationally and particularly in south Tipperary. I was given the impression at the beginning of the budget speech that the Minister for Finance was taking very seriously the problem of unemployment and that the budget would have job creation as its core theme.  Surely this will do nothing for the creation of jobs within the cider industry from which my local community benefit enormously.  I hope it will not have a negative effect on employment in south Tipperary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am awash with questions and information.  It is very difficult for me to decide which queries I can answer because I shall not have time to answer them all.</P>
      <P>First of all, let me deal with one question raised about dedicating revenue either from tobacco tax or from cider/perry tax to a specific health education purpose.  Nothing of that kind is in accord with good financial administration or taxation practice.  All the revenue must go into a central pool and be allocated from there in accordance with specific priorities.  It would be a complete distortion to take tax from one section and allocate it to another.  That is just by way of general comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies are completely misreading the position in regard to cider. First of all, cider and perry consumption has been growing very strongly throughout the eighties, having grown by nearly 20 per cent in 1990 and a further 29 per cent last year.  I do not think that is any reflection of abuse, not at all, but simply a reflection of better products, more attractive marketing and advertising. Traditionally cider and perry have been taxed at a very low rate having been regarded as a poor man's product or <Col N="487" /> drink and because their consumption was very small.  That position has changed completely and their consumption is growing substantially.  Cider is very lowly taxed in comparison with other alcoholic beverages and something will have to happen about that.  The Minister's proposal really springs from Community proposals.  For example, there is a proposal within the Community that, under the 1992 regime, cider products would be charged at 50 per cent of the national wine rate.  That would mean that, instead of the present 93p per gallon, cider would go up to £4 per gallon.  That is what the European Commission is proposing.  The cider industry is very perturbed at that and the Minister is very sympathetic to their case, but let us be realistic.  As I have said, cider is rated much lower than any corresponding beverage and is growing substantially in its consumption and share of the market.  Taking all those facts into account what the Minister proposes here is very reasonable indeed.  Certainly it is very reasonable compared with what the EC Commission has in mind and, I am quite certain, will not have the slightest effect on employment.</P>
    <P>On the question of leaded petrol, the reduction will apply to both leaded and unleaded petrol.  The differential will be maintained.  That is not unreasonable.  It is one thing, when one is increasing the tax to give a differential to leaded petrol but, when one is reducing the rate of duty, unleaded petrol will still be cheaper to purchase though the differential will be the same.  Things are moving considerably in favour of the use of unleaded petrol.  The differential will continue but I might add that consumption of unleaded petrol is now almost 30 per cent and still increasing.  Catalytic convertors are becoming increasingly standard in cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is a tendentious remark.  They will be mandatory from 1 January 1993.  Therefore, the use of unleaded petrol will increase even <Col N="488" /> further.  The position in regard to the relative consumption of leaded and unleaded petrol is moving very favourably indeed and this particular proposal will maintain the differential.</P>
      <P>A question which has excited much comment here is that of motor vehicles generally.  I should like to give a simple picture of that position.  I will deal with 1992 only because to deal with a full year would only complicate the position.  The reduction in hydrocarbons, petrol, will cost the Exchequer £13 million.  The changes in excise duties on motor vehicles will reduce receipts to the Exchequer by £27.5 million and the changes in the car tax will yield extra revenue of £27.5 million.  Therefore the changes in excise duties on motor vehicles and so on will exactly counter-balance the increase in car taxes.  It will be seen that the motorist is not losing anything there. In fact the overall package will mean a loss of £13 million to the Exchequer.  Slice it how one may, the motorist in 1992 will gain an extra £13 million at the expense of the Exchequer.  There will be ups and downs within the motor industry but, by and large, the Minister, in an excessively generous gesture is handing back to the motorist public this year a net saving of £13 million.  The changes being effected are sensible, particularly in view of preparedness in regard to the European Community and the single market.</P>
      <P>The fascinating argument about cigarettes, health and the cost of cigarettes to employed persons has been going on for a very long time.  I do not want to be politically tendentious about it but the Government of which Deputy Spring and others here were members imposed a 10p increase on a packet of cigarettes four years in succession, 10p on the packet of cigarettes each year.  So let us have no crocodile tears or smoke about this.</P>

      <P>Cigarettes and beer were always known in budgetary terms <Col N="489" /> as the old reliables.  It is very easy to wax indignant here about them.  My view is that the increases imposed by Ministers for Finance from time to time are accepted with a certain amount of resignation by the smoking public.  Such increases have nearly come to be expected as a matter of course.  I am a great authority on this question of the cost of cigarettes in relation to heatlh. When I was Minister for Health I had occasion to go into it in great detail. There is no doubt that increasing the price of cigarettes and tobacco has only a minimal effect as a disincentive.  In fact the fall-off in consumption built into the figures this year is represented by 2 per cent only diminishing returns.  I doubt if even that is realised.  Therefore, there is no doubt that Ministers for Finance consistently increase the cost of cigarettes not for health reasons but to raise revenue. I am quite astonished that somebody should point the accusing finger at the present Minister and say: &ldquo;Oh, you are behaving dreadfully; all you are doing here is raising money&rdquo;.  That is what a budget is all about, to raise money.</P>

It is not very easy to get <Col N="490" /> people who are addicted to smoking to stop, although we may get them to reduce consumption.

      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 7:</P>
      <P>(1)  THAT&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Chapter IX of Part I of, and the Third Schedule to, the Finance Act, 1982 (No. 14 of 1982), shall not apply or have effect in relation to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  any shares acquired with any moneys paid on or after the 29th day of January, 1992, by a company (being the company concerned, or as the case may be, a participating company) to the trustees of an approved scheme or to the trustees of a group scheme for the purpose of acquiring shares for appropriation to a participant in that approved scheme or that group scheme, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  any shares acquired with any moneys so paid before the 29th day of January, 1992, where the said shares are acquired by the said trustees on or after the 6th day of April, 1992.</P>
      <P>(b)  In this paragraph &ldquo;approved scheme&rdquo;, &ldquo;the company concerned&rdquo;, &ldquo;group scheme&rdquo;, &ldquo;participant&rdquo;, &ldquo;participating company&rdquo;, &ldquo;shares&rdquo; and &ldquo;the trustees&rdquo; have the same meaning as they have in the said Chapter IX and the said Third Schedule.</P>
      <P>(2)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>The purpose of this resolution is to abolish the tax relief available in respect of shares granted by companies to their employees under approved profit-sharing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resolution abolishes the relief in respect of shares acquired by the trustees of such schemes with funds paid over to them on or after today.  The tax position <Col N="495" /> of shares already allocated to employees before today will not be affected; neither will the position of shares acquired before today by trustees of approved profit-sharing schemes but not yet allocated to employees.  Also unaffected will be shares purchased by trustees with funds paid over to them before today but not yet invested in shares, provided that the funds are invested before 5 April next.</P>

      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 8:</P>
      <P>(1)  THAT section 10 of, and the Second Schedule to, the Finance Act, 1986 (No. 13 of 1986), shall not apply or have effect in respect of a right (within the meaning of the said section 10) to acquire shares in a body corporate obtained on or after the 29th day of January, 1992.</P>
      <P>(2)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>The purpose of this financial resolution is to abolish the concessionary tax treatment available in respect of share options granted under approved share option schemes.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, share options are rights to acquire shares in a company, and are often given to directors and employees of a company as part of their remuneration package.  A concessionary tax regime applies to share options granted under approved share option schemes, which were provided for in the Finance Act, 1986.  Briefly, this provides that there is no income tax charge and that capital gains tax applies instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution abolishes the concessionary tax regime in respect of share options granted on or after today.  Share <Col N="496" /> options granted before today are not affected.</P>

      <P>(1)  THAT, the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, (No. 7 of 1976), shall, as respects distributions received by a person on or after the 29th day of January, 1992, be amended as follows&mdash;</P>

      <P>`the relieved amount' means so much of a distribution to which section 64 applies as is determined by the formula&mdash;</P>
      <img websrc="/graphics/D.0415.0496.1.gif" />
      <P>where&mdash;</P>

    <P>`the relieved distribution' has the meaning assigned to it in subsection (2);</P>

    <P>(b)  as respects distributions received by a person in the year 1987-88 and subsequent years of assessment, for the purposes of applying the provisions of subsection (3) to distributions received by the person on or after the 29th day of January, 1992,</P>
    <P>so much of a distribution to which section 64 applies as is the relieved amount shall be treated as a separate distribution (hereafter in this section referred to, in particular, as `the relieved distribution') received by the person in respect of which he shall not be entitled to a tax credit, and the remainder, if any, of the distribution to which section 64 applies shall be treated as a separate distribution received by him in respect of which the tax credit shall be the tax credit in respect of the distribution to which section 64 applies.</P>
    <P>(3)  The relieving provisions shall not have effect as respects any distribution received by a person on or after the 29th day of January, 1992:</P>
    <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii)  the amount by which the adjusted average relieved distribution in relation to those distributions exceeds the total amount of relieved distributions, if any, received by the person from the company on or after the 6th day of April, 1991, and before the 29th day of January, 1992,</P>
    <P>shall not be regarded as income for any of the purposes of the Income Tax Acts other than the purposes of section 54 of the Finance Act, 1974;</P>
    <P>(b)  two-thirds of so much of the total amount of relieved distributions received by a person from a company in the year 1992-93 as does not exceed the adjusted average relieved distribution in relation to those distributions, shall not be regarded as income for any of the purposes of the Income Tax Acts other than the purposes of the said section 54; and</P>
    <P>(c)  one-third of so much of the total amount of relieved distributions received by a person from a company in the year 1993-94 as does not exceed the adjusted average relieved distribution in relation to those distributions, shall not be regarded as income for any of the purposes of the Income Tax Acts other than the purposes of the said section 54.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where by virtue of this section the relieving provisions are not to apply to a distribution to which section 64 applies, then that distribution shall be ignored for the purposes of section 54 of the Finance Act, 1974:</P>
    <P>Provided that where an amount <Col N="499" /> representing relieved distributions is not to be regarded as income for any of the purposes of the Income Tax Acts by virtue of this section, other than the purposes of the said section 54, it shall not be so ignored.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(b)  in Part V by the insertion after section 76 of the following section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;76A.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>`the adjusted average distribution', in relation to a distribution received by a person from a company, means five-fourths of the average distribution in relation to the distribution received by the person from the company;</P>
    <P>`the average distribution', in relation to a distribution received by a person from a company, means one-quarter of the total amount of distributions received by the person from the company in the years 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91;</P>

    <P>(2)  Where a person receives any distributions on or after the 29th day of January, 1992, the relieving provisions shall not apply to those distributions:</P>
    <P>Provided that this subsection shall not have effect in respect of&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> (a)  as respects the year 1991-92, two-thirds of the lesser of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the total amount of distributions received by a person from a company on or after the 29th day of January, 1992, and before the 6th day of April, 1992, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the amount by which the adjusted average distribution in relation to those distributions exceeds the total amount of distributions, if any, received by the person from the company on or after the 6th day of April, 1991, and before the 29th day of January, 1992,</P>
    <P>(b)  two-thirds of so much of the total amount of distributions received by a person from a company in the year 1992-93 as does not exceed the adjusted average distribution in relation to those distributions, and</P>

    <P>(3)  Where, by virtue of this section, the relieving provisions are not to apply to an amount representing distributions received by a person from a company, those distributions shall be disregarded for the purposes of section 54 of the Finance Act, 1974, to the extent of that amount.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(2)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>The purpose of Financial Resolution <Col N="501" /> No. 9 is to wind up the tax-free status of certain dividends paid by exporting companies or companies located in Shannon Airport out of reserves of tax-free profits accumulated in the seventies and eighties.  The tax exemption of export sales and Shannon Airport profits from corporation tax ended in April 1990. Since then the companies in question have had the full benefit of manufacturing relief which reduces their corporation tax to a rate of 10 per cent. Dividends paid out of 10 per cent profits are not tax-free &mdash; they are chargeable to tax.  In these circumstances, it is inconsistent that companies benefiting fully from the 10 per cent scheme of corporation tax should be able to preserve indefinitely a capacity to pay tax-free dividends, long after the underlying corporation tax exemption has ended. Furthermore, instances have arisen where those tax-free dividends have been substituted in a contrived manner for normal taxable remuneration.  Accordingly, the Government has decided to abolish, on a phased basis, the exempt status of dividends received out of export sales or Shannon Airport profits with effect on and from today.</P>

      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 10:</P>
      <P>(1)  THAT section 14 of the Finance Act, 1986 (No. 13 of 1986), shall not apply or have effect in relation to any qualifying dividend (within the meaning of that section) that is paid on or after the 29th day of January, 1992.</P>
      <P>(2)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Resolution relates to section 14 of the Finance Act, 1986, and proposes that <Col N="502" /> the relief afforded by that section be abolished as respects dividends paid on or after today.</P>
    <P>The relief operates by excluding from a charge to income tax one-half of the dividend income received by individual shareholders from companies qualifying for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  The maximum amount which can be excluded is £7,000 per annum, or £9,000 in the case of companies with approved profit-sharing schemes.</P>
    <P>The main purpose behind the introduction of the relief in 1986 was to encourage equity investment in domestic manufacturing companies.  There is little evidence that the relief has served its original purpose to any significant extent It has, however, been widely abused through several contrived arrangements, which maximised the Exchequer cost, and substituted tax-relieved dividends for taxable remuneration.</P>
    <P>Taking all these considerations into account, the Government have decided to end the relief as respects manufacturing dividends paid on or after today.</P>

      <P>(1)  THAT section 34 of the Finance Act, 1974 (No. 27 of 1974), and section 8 of the Finance Act, 1978 (No. 21 of 1978), shall not apply or have effect in relation to any payment of interest on a loan applied on or after the 29th day of January, 1992, for a purpose specified in those sections if the company, part of whose ordinary share capital was or is acquired or, as the case may be, to which the money was or is lent, is a quoted company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  THAT, as respects the year of assessment 1992-93 and subsequent years of assessment, notwithstanding the provisions of section 34 of the Finance Act, 1974, and section 8 of the Finance Act, 1978, but subject to paragraph (3) of this Resolution, relief <Col N="503" /> under those sections in respect of interest paid on a loan applied before the 29th day of January, 1992, for a purpose specified in those sections shall, if the company, part of whose ordinary share capital was acquired or, as the case may be, to which the money was lent, is, at the time the interest is paid, a quoted company, be given according to the following provisions, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in relation to any interest paid in respect of a period consisting of all or part of the year of assessment 1992-93, relief shall not be given in respect of the excess of the amount, or of the aggregate amount, of the interest over 70 per cent.  of the amount, or of the aggregate amount, of the interest in respect of which, apart from this paragraph, relief would otherwise have been given under those provisions,</P>
    <P>(b)  in relation to any interest paid in respect of a period consisting of all or part of the year of assessment 1993-94, relief shall not be given in respect of the excess of the amount, or of the aggregate amount, of the interest over 40 per cent.  of the amount, or the aggregate amount, of the interest in respect of which, apart from this paragraph, relief would otherwise have been given under those provisions, and</P>
    <P>(c)  in relation to interest paid in respect of any period in the year of assessment 1994-95 or a subsequent year of assessment, no relief shall be given.</P>
    <P>(3)  THAT where, on or after the 6th day of April, 1991, a company becomes a quoted company, the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Resolution shall apply and have effect in relation to the years subsequent to the happening of that event as if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the reference to the year of assessment 1992-93 were a reference to the second year of assessment <Col N="504" /> after the year of assessment in which the company becomes a quoted company.</P>
    <P>(b)  the reference to the year of assessment 1993-94 were a reference to the third year of assessment after the year of assessment in which the company becomes a quoted company, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the reference to the year of assessment 1994-95 were a reference to the fourth year of assessment after the company becomes a quoted company.</P>
    <P>(4)  THAT in this Resolution &ldquo;quoted company&rdquo; means a company whose shares, or any class of whose shares&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  are listed in the official list of the Irish Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange, or</P>
    <P>(b)  are dealt in on the smaller companies market, the unlisted securities market or the exploration securities market of the Irish Stock Exchange or on any similar or corresponding market of any other stock exchange.</P>
    <P>(5)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution relates to the income tax relief available to employees and directors on loans taken out to purchase shares in, or make a loan to, the company which employs them.  The Government have decided to abolish this relief in respect of loans related to quoted companies, which have access to capital through the stock market.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, no relief will be available on loans relating to such companies taken out on or after today, and relief on existing loans relating to such companies is being phased out: relief will be available on only 70 per cent of the amount of qualifying interest in 1992-93, and on <Col N="505" /> only 40 per cent in 1993-94; no relief will be available in 1994-95.  Where companies obtained a quotation after 5 April 1991, the phasing out will not begin until the 1993-94 tax year.  Where companies obtain a quotation from now on, relief will not be available in respect of loans taken out on or after the date of flotation; phasing out of relief on loans taken out before that date will begin in the second-next tax year after flotation.</P>
    <P>This Financial Resolution provides accordingly, and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 12:</P>
      <P>(1)  THAT, as respects any repayment of contributions referred to in section 21 of the Finance Act, 1972 (No. 19 of 1972), which is made on or after the 29th day of January, 1992, the said section 21 shall apply and have effect as if, in subsection (2), &ldquo;25 per cent.&rdquo;  were substituted for &ldquo;10 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(2)  THAT subsection (2) of section 22 of the Finance Act, 1972, shall not be affected by the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Resolution.</P>
      <P>(3)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>This resolution provides for an increase, from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, in the rate of tax charged on refunds of pension contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual makes contributions to a pension scheme, he gets tax relief for them at normal tax rates. Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1972, provides that, where contributions are later refunded, the refund is taxed at 10 per cent.  The charge is imposed to recover, <Col N="506" /> in some measure, the tax relief previously given in respect of those contributions.</P>
    <P>Refunds of contributions are running at some £20 million a year and this Resolution will update the tax charge to the more realistic level of 25 per cent in respect of refunds made on or after today.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that there is no change in the tax relief available on the making of contributions to pension funds; it is only the tax charge on refunds that is being increased.</P>
    <P>I commend this resolution to the House.</P>

    <P>This resolution provides that: (a) the value for tax purposes of a company car, which an employee may use for private purposes and with all the running costs paid by the employer, shall be increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the original market value of the car.

The resolution provides that the minimum charge of 12.5 per cent will be increased to 18.5 per cent, while the intervening charges between 12.5 per cent and 20 per cent will be increased <i>pro rata;</i> (c) in the coming tax year tapering relief for employees with high business mileage will come into play only for <Col N="508" /> employees who drive at least 15,000 business miles a year, instead of 10,000 business miles at present; and (d) the maximum tapering relief available will be reduced from 100 per cent to 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>These changes will apply from 6 April 1992.</P>

    <P>This resolution provides for the withdrawal of income tax relief for life assurance premiums paid on or after 6 April 1992.</P>
    <P>Before 1989, relief was in general allowed on half the premiums paid.  In 1989 this relief was reduced to 80 per cent of the pre-1989 level.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I understand I was not being heard.  These financial resolutions clearly indicate to this side of the House how the budget was <Col N="510" /> constructed.  Arising from the agreement between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in the late autumn, it is quite clear that an income tax package, which would involve the reduction of the standard rate from 29 per cent to 27 per cent and the establishment of one higher rate &mdash; which now transpires to be 48 per cent &mdash; was sacrosanct.  This was a nonnegotiable item.</P>
      <P>The theory of the tax reform package was that the base would be widened to fund these measures.  Various deities were called in support of this theological argument, the Commission on Taxation, IMF, NESC, the social partners and Uncle Tom Cobley and all.  It broke down because, even though the Progressive Democrats had stated that there were tax relief measures, shelters and various other wheezes amounting to something like £2.35 billion available to fund the tax package, when it came to examining it on the serious level of a budget discussion all this scope evaporated.  Then the Fianna Fáil Party took the two items where there was real scope &mdash; as the Taoiseach is finishing, he knows I am accurate, and because we were there one time as well, we could have written the script&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Fianna Fáil then took off the table mortgage interest and VHI reliefs, where there was real scope, and the Progressive Democrats were left with a multiplicity of extraneous items calculated to produce the maximum aggravation for the minimum yield.  We now have the Financial Resolutions which will give £38 million and which left the Government on the day £130 million short on the package. At that stage they raided the VAT but could not bring down the standard rate; they also raided excise but could not do much about that and transferred the costs.  In the final analysis the only recourse open to them was to stick £51 <Col N="511" /> million to the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This group of measures is theologically led.  I sympathise with the Fianna Fáil Party because when a party get dug into an ideological or theological position they do not measure the merits of a tax relief or try to evaluate it; rather they believe <i>ab initio</i> it is bad so it must go.  This leads on into making absurb decisions.</P>
      <P>Some of these measures are quite acceptable but others are daft because they yield very little, upset many people, depress economic activity and nobody gains.  The Exchequer does not gain and individuals and the wider community lose.  That is the kind of situation an ideologically driven party arrive at if they fail to deliver on the main aspects of the ideology.  That is the problem we face here.</P>
      <P>Profit sharing relief and share option relief were introduced to provide incentives. It is difficult in a country where there are high taxes to adequately reward people at senior level whose skills are internationally marketable.  In other words, how can one get a chief executive who has to pay high PRSI and tax rates to work in Galway when it is company policy that he should be paid the same as a chief executive in Cinncinnati?  How can he be given the same net pay if company policy ties him to the same gross pay?  We introduced these measures so that breaks of a very restrictive kind would benefit these people.  The Government in their wisdom have decided to take them out of the system from 6 April next.  I suggest that for the yield involved this was not worth doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Financial Resolution No. 9 proposes to abolish the tax relief given to manufacturing companies at Shannon Airport. This will yield very little.  One of the greatest flags for begrudgers is the idea that Tony Ryan and the people in GPA can distribute a tax free dividend.  Not alone did the begrudgers go crazy <Col N="512" /> because the export credit relief for these companies was zero rated, and they did not think it was satisfactory to raise it to only 10 per cent, but they went on to say that if they distributed dividends they should pay full tax on them.  That is fair enough, but this is a very mobile industry. Tony Ryan could set up his headquarters in Seattle near his main supplier.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is a factor and he always put it up front, even to the degree that he required his managers to live in the region.  He had a view of regional policy which he applied to his own company.  What I am saying is that in the larger scheme of things it does not matter whether this relief goes or stays. The relief applies to so few people that there is an element of begrudgery in targeting it.  The people being targeted are mobile and can easily set up their headquarters elsewhere, and there would be no gain to the Exchequer.  The question of interest relief on the purchase of shares can be discussed in the debate on the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Financial Resolution No. 12 is most peculiar. I believe this proposition has been foisted on the Minister for Finance who did not understand the real implications of it.  To my mind, there are only two categories of people who voluntarily withdraw their contributions from pension funds.  Most working people want their money in a good pension fund.  They want the pension fund to thrive until they draw their pensions.  As I said, there are only two categories of people who take their contributions from pension funds.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I reject that comment.  I am making a serious point.  The first category are spouses who decide in certain circumstances that only one spouse should work.  This applies <Col N="513" /> in particular to wives who calculate the package they will get if they leave work and who withdraw their contributions from the pension fund, which will only be taxed at 10 per cent.  However, from now on this will be taxed at 25 per cent. This means that many of them will decide to stay at work with the result that those expected vacancies will not arise.</P>
      <P>The other category who will withdraw their contributions from a pension fund do so when they become redundant or when the company goes under leaving them no choice but to withdraw their contributions.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> They get a lump sum but if they are employed by another company they have to use that money to buy into that company's pension scheme.  They are recycling their contributions.  Yet, it is proposed to take 25 per cent off their contributions.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is now 25 per cent and it was even wrong at 10 per cent.  If it was zero rated it would make more sense.  The 25 per cent rate is outrageous when one analyses the categories of people it affects.  In a country where there is such a high level of unemployment, where redundancies in every sector are a weekly phenomenon and where people have to use their pension funds to buy into new schemes, this is an outrageous proposal and there is no justification for it.</P>
      <P>The treatment of company cars is very severe.  It is very hard to assess the detail of any financial resolution and how it will impact on any individual taxpayer.  The Minister said that this proposal would yield £17 million.  That is a lot of money to take from commercial travellers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is a lot of money to take from a very small group.  The Minister in his wisdom has to measure these things but I wonder about the wisdom of this proposal.</P>
      <P>Financial Resolution No. 14 is another begrudger's proposal.  Young men and women who work in banks, building societies and insurance companies get preferential loans.  However, somebody has now decided that they are getting away with something and there should be a return to the Exchequer.  It is now proposed, in a mean minded way, to increase the interest on those loans and I am sure the yield will be very small.  This is another example of how an ideological-driven party decide all these reliefs are bad so they must be abolished.  I agree with the Fianna Fáil position on mortgage interest relief and VHI relief, but the main reliefs, which are the big drain on revenue, will remain intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have accepted the demand side of the Progressive Democrats agenda but they failed to produce the supply side to give the revenue.  This results in the ludicrous, damaging situation of increasing VAT from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent.  Instead of using that revenue to bring down the standard rate of VAT from 21 per cent to a reasonable level with the beneficial impact that would have on the economy, it is brought over to the income tax side.  This budget is clearly a compromise on what the Progressive Democrats demanded on income tax &mdash; a total veto on how it should be funded and all these shelters and reliefs which were supposed to make available billions of pounds yield only £38 million.  The Government end up increasing VAT and bringing that money to the income tax side, and also increasing excise duty.  Borrowing is £51 million extra and for the first time in five years the EBR is higher than the previous year's outturn.  That again puts us on the slippery slope when you take into account the commitments for 1993 which are implicit in this budget.  Finally, we come to the top-of-the-head figure &mdash; better collection methods are supposed to produce £45 million.  This budget is the <Col N="515" /> fall-out from ideology crashing into realism.  The pragmatism of Fianna Fáil crashed with the ideology of the Progressive Democrats and the result is a budget with bits and pieces of debris all over the floor.  The Taoiseach is amused because he knows I have hit the nail on the head.  I think he was right and they were wrong.  He should have beaten them down on the supply side as well as on the demand side.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with life assurance relief.  Only 12.5 per cent or one-eighth of premiums on insurance policies written since 1979 was subject to tax and it was quite clear that it was being phased out. What I object to is that this is combined with very heavy impositions on companies in a very technical section which we can explore fully in the Finance Bill. I would be uneasy about hitting the insurance industry at both ends.  The investor is being hit on the premium side and the company is being hit on the other side.  On the life assurance side, for the ordinary individual who has a life policy there is not very much relief anyway because it is subject to a ceiling and it only applies to one-eighth of the annual premium on Irish policies written since 1979.  I would like the Taoiseach to explain more fully the intentions on the impositions on companies.  Perhaps he would diverge a little and say something about the impositions on unit trusts which will fall back on the insurance companies. It seems there is a lot of money involved <Col N="516" /> there.  I wonder if in 1993 companies involved in unit trust activity can afford a flow of £45 million or £50 million out of their profits.</P>
    <P>There was a time &mdash; Deputy FitzGerald is here near me &mdash; when we imposed certain tax penalties on insurance companies and after discussion with the companies post-budget, significant amendments had to be brought in between budget day and the introduction of the Finance Bill simply to prevent insurance companies from going under. The ones on the margins could not endure the imposition and we admitted that at the time and reversed our position. I would be concerned not about this measure but about the one whereby insurance companies are being penalised. We will be voting at 10.50 p.m. against this package of resolutions.  Some of them do not cause us much concern but there are others about which we feel quite strongly and as they will all be taken together by one vote we will be voting against them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that other Deputies wish to speak and I will therefore try to be very brief, to the point and not repeat what has been said already.  The Finance Bill will change entirely or alter significantly some of the provisions we will vote upon tonight.  From the limited advice I have received in respect of Financial Resolution No. 9, for example, there will be a legal question as to whether that element of retrospection is constitutional, and that is certainly going to be challenged.  On Financial Resolutions Nos. 7 and 8, the intent for which these measures were introduced in 1986 was to encourage workers participating in the equity base of their companies. There may have been a disappointing response to that original proposal and in some cases it may have been abused, but it is a mistake to simply get rid of all these measures and others throughout the taxation system without introducing some mechanism, as the Culliton report suggested, to provide for equity-based investment in industry from the income tax sector.  It is simply not true to suggest <Col N="517" /> by way of defence, as the Minister has done, that most companies now have access to the capital markets if they are quoted as USMs or on the full quotation.  One door has been closed with an element of begrudgery, and I share Deputy Noonan's analysis in that respect.</P>
      <P>When the business sector and their trade union representatives take all these matters into account and find that the subsidised meals in the canteen are a fringe benefit that has to be taxed by the company, it will be a recipe for uncertainty, anger and frustration.  There will be a lot of needle pricking, the full extent of which none of us is entirely sure about at present but which from what I have been able to gather since 7 p.m., leads me to believe that for reasons that do not make sense &mdash; they certainly do not make sense to the traditional pragmatism of Fianna Fáil &mdash; these resolutions will result in a lot of unnecessary and unquantifiable annoyance for very little return. I hope that the people who have insisted upon it, the Progressive Democrats, get their return because I certainly do not see a return for the other partners in this Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask one specific question in relation to life assurance relief.  I have not been able to get information on this matter and as has been said already the Finance Bill will probably clarify it but I would like to know in what way, if any, will the proposed change in Financial Resolution No. 15 affect endowment mortgages and what will be the likely impact of that proposal?  This does not strike me as being an expansionist proposal, and the savings that will be derived will be minimal.  In many companies, including smaller companies, there will be a lot of annoyance and unnecessary disruption as a result of this measure which, if it is being wilfully introduced, is manifest incompetence and irresponsible or, if it is not being wilfully introduced, is simply incompetent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This panel of resolutions exposes the sham of the Progressive Democrats' tax reform policies.  It is absurd that we have to scrape the pot in <Col N="518" /> the manner that is being suggested in some of these resolutions to find a few bob to fund this obsession with reaching ultimately the 25 per cent standard rate of tax.  Whether it is 27 per cent or 48 per cent is almost irrelevant.  What matters is at what stage you become liable for tax in the first place and how long you remain on the standard band before you go to the marginal rates.  They are the issues but they have not been addressed.  I remember specifically that the Minister of State with responsibility for environmental protection, Deputy Harney, was trotted out because her soft focus was more appropriate than that of former Deputy McDowell.  She told us there was £2 billion in these disgraceful tax shelters and various reliefs and tax foregone to industry that would be mopped up to fund the tax reform programme.  It is almost unbelievable that we are now being presented with an attack on the minimalist measures that have been made to bring about a share owning democracy, which I thought the Progressive Democrats were in favour of. I thought the purpose of profit sharing schemes was to involve workers in taking out shares in their own enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to listen until the cows came home to the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, telling me about the fantastic number of shares he was making available to ordinary workers in the sugar company.  He made a great many shares in the sugar company available to people who were not ordinary workers, but we only discovered that subsequently.  In addition the Government are to abolish the shares option relief, yet they are trying to present this as some kind of concession to equity when, in fact, it will have the opposite effect.  Surely more economic democracy, greater worker participation and more industrial democracy are elements of our industrial revival.  It is disgraceful that the Government have come up with this measure for the sake of collecting minimal income.  We have not been given the opportunity to assess how much it will be under each heading. This ought to be vigorously opposed.  I <Col N="519" /> suspect &mdash; I do not wish to go into the export sales relief at Shannon &mdash; that if Tony Ryan was in the Financial Services Centre at the end of Gardiner Street he would not be expected to deal with a measure like that being proposed but I will leave this for Deputies Noonan and Carey to deal with.</P>
    <P>In 1988, 78,383 new cars were registered and it is estimated about half were company cars.  The proposal to make such a drastic change in the manner in which benefit-in-kind is calculated will impact on many ordinary workers who need a car for their job.  I spent a good deal of time in my former job negotiating on this with employers.  To increase the threshold from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the market price of the car, as proposed, and to raise the mileage allowance will impact severely on many people who need a car to do their job.  Ordinary workers will be affected.  It may be that this was abused in certain areas, but I suggest the abuse could be tackled by a mileage threshold.  Where workers need a car to go to work, or in the case of commerical travellers who absolutely need a car, this measure proposed is regressive and the former Deputy McDowell should be told that.  We are talking about a tax yield of £16.2 million this year and £27 million in a full year, an extremely large tax take when one considers the pittance being raised from other measures.  It is in stark contrast with the capital allowances for motor cars used for private business.  The threshold for capital allowances for the self-employed engaged in private business has been enhanced from £7,000 to £10,000 but the PAYE worker who needs a car for his job is punished.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan said, the suggestion on pension refunds is extraordinary. Only a fool would cash in his pension half way through the period of the scheme. Nobody would do so unless forced to do so through unemployment.  Indeed, this is a subject very close to the heart of Deputy Gilmore and me.  A person of 40 years of age would not take out contributions accumulated over a 15-year <Col N="520" /> period from a pension fund.  It may be that the pension will not buy more than a box of matches in 25 years time, but it is bad economics to take it in the form of a refund.  The only person who would do this would be a person who is made redundant.</P>

      <P>To subject a person who has funded a pension scheme all his or her working life to an increase from 10 per cent to 25 per cent is disgraceful.  It is a regressive measure.  If the Progressive Democrats wing of the Government manage to convey these changes as progressive and pro-jobs tax reforming, it will be a disgrace, because on the contrary they are regressive and are scraping the pot to find minimal revenue to fund the obsession with tax reform.  The Progressive Democrats told the people they would deliver a 25 per cent standard rate of tax and it seems that if it is the last thing they do, they will deliver on that.  They want to be able to say at the next general election that they delivered on their promise.  The people have become more sophisticated since that promise won seats in the 1987 general election.  Then it was a great idea. We all want to pay income tax at the rate of 25 per cent but when one gets down to study the nuts and bolts of taxation it is not as simple as that.  These are appalling motions and we will be vigorously opposing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the group of resolutions on income tax. It is evident the Government do not understand that their policies are creating a poverty trap.  I sat in this House for five budgets and I saw the poverty trap being widened by a series of unco-ordinated Government decisions.  Let us compare for instance what has been done in relation to social welfare and income tax. Social welfare has quite rightly been indexed, indeed it will rise by 4 per cent. <Col N="521" /> However, so long as social welfare is indexed and the income tax bands and allowances are not, one is widening the poverty trap and those in employment are being put at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the unemployed.  To put it more correctly, it is being made more difficult for those on social welfare to take up jobs. No matter how badly off one is on social welfare a person with one or two children will be worse off earning the average industrial wage.  Indeed, the Minister for Finance admitted this when he was Minister for Labour.  This gap will be widened in this budget.</P>
      <P>I compiled tables for every budget in the past four years and they have been validated and accepted in this House. Last year, for example a man on the average industrial wage with a wife and four children was worse off to the tune of £23 per week than a couple with four children and on unemployment assistance. After the 1988 budget they were only £3 a week worse off.  The gap widened by £20 in four years and this year it will widen still further.  That is the central reason economic growth in this country turns in fewer jobs than economic growth in any other country.  It is very clear that the Government do not understand that. I am not surprised they do not understand it, because in this country we lack a Department of employment, the need for which is self-evident.  There should be one Department to co-ordinate all aspects of Government policy that affect the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are things that appear unrelated to the labour market that are decided in the Department of the Environment, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, for instance, the means testing of allowances and differential rents.  Decisions are made during the Estimates campaign, before the budget and in the budget which mean that at about this time rents on local authority houses are being increased.  The rent of people who work is assessed on gross pay, not take-home pay.  It can happen that a married couple with three children whose take-home pay is £140 pay three times as much rent as the man next door <Col N="522" /> who has the same income or more through social welfare benefits.  Similarly, if one applies to the Department of Education for a third level education grant, if the education grant is higher than one's take-home pay, one can be disqualified, while the man next door in receipt of social welfare benefits will get the grant.  The position is the same when it comes to civil legal aid and criminal legal aid, and the family income supplement, which is not based on real wealth but on a person's gross pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two very brief questions.  I should like to hear the Taoiseach reflect on the suggestion that what is proposed would, for example, make it difficult for employees anxious to save a company to move from a wage relationship to a share structure relationship.  I envisage a situation where this measure would impede such a possibility.  In other words, a genuine aspiration is being made impossible by what I would accept as a genuine attempt to eliminate abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second query relates to pension contributions.  If one fact has been obvious in recent times, it is that Irish labour force activity is characterised by greater mobility.  How can the Government penalise people by taxing pension <Col N="523" /> contributions more heavily without having first put in place a mechanism that would allow for the transition of contributions from one employment to another?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to what has already been said.  This budget proves one thing &mdash; if a person living in this country tries to do something for himself or herself, then he or she is stark raving mad.  It is about time someone spoke for those who are endeavouring to raise families, to do things for themselves and to provide by way of life assurance for the education of their children, the purchase of their own home or to protect their family in the event of premature death.</P>
      <P>We are taking all the soft options here, and for what?  I have listened to the argument about a 25 per cent and a 45 per cent tax rate.  Is someone saying that if I raise a family, have a mortgage and pay my life assurance, all these concessions will be wiped away and a single person with no responsibilities will reap the benefit? What kind of society are we talking about?  We are not talking just about tax, we are talking about the kind of society we are building.  What we are doing here is destroying the kind of society that was very precious to many decent, honest-to-God, Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of nonsense has been spoken about life assurance companies as if they are a soft touch.  Do people realise that at the moment there is a gentlemen's agreement whereby 80 per cent of premiums collected in this country over the years is invested in this country?  That agreement accounts for billions of pounds worth of investment.  However, with the advent of 1993, gentlemen's agreements are going out the window and insurance companies will be quite <Col N="524" /> entitled to take their billions out of this country and invest them elsewhere throughout the EC.  Do Members realise what they are doing when they start to talk about taxing trusts and doing all kinds of weird and wonderful things in order to scrape the barrel to get a few pounds, as Deputy Noonan says, to satisfy a political promise made some where down the line?</P>
    <P>I want to ask a question of those who advocate the abolition of life assurance relief.  What will be the position of someone who is buying a home through an endowment mortgage?  Those people are now faced with an increase.  There is a huge outcry if there is a 1 per cent increase in mortgage rates but now, with one stroke of the pen, the House is about to increase mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Taoiseach wants to reply so I shall close my contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put one comment on the record, that is, that a tax system is supposed to be fair and equitable.  In my view, it is basically unfair and inequitable that people who have made plans for life assurance because of the tax provisions and have made long term commitments &mdash; particularly if they have committed themselves to endowment policies and are purchasing houses with the assistance of those politics &mdash; should find their incentives being taken away in one fell swoop. It is wrong and unfair to take away that incentive and it is contrary to what a tax system should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for me in the time available to attempt to deal with the arguments that have been made here.  I think that, logically, they are more Finance Bill issues than budgetary issues to be discussed at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of the shelters and concessions were introduced for a very good purpose but in many cases they are being used for no other purpose than to fund or make possible carefully contrived tax evasion mechanisms.  Unfortunately, that is the position with regard to most of those concessions and that is the thinking <Col N="525" /> behind it.  I do not think the House can argue very trenchantly or with any great deal of force for a number of those shelters and devices which benefit only a small number of people but benefit them to a very great extent, at the expense of the general body of taxpayers.  I do not think there is any real argument either for restricting or eliminating most of them.</P>
    <P>Several points have been made in the debate.  Some speakers said that people on the 48 per cent tax rate do not gain at all.  Of course, they do.  Many speakers are ignoring the fact that the tax bands have been very substantially increased &mdash; in the case of single people on the standard rate by £775 and for married people by twice that, £1,550.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan suggested that when the Government were trying to do their sums and they did not add up they just added £50 million to the Exchequer borrowing. They did not.  In spite of all the prognostications, we were able to keep the Exchequer borrowing at 2.4 per cent this year, which is a very creditable achievement.</P>

All the concessions which have been done away with affect a very limited number of people and in many cases the concessions were being abused.  Deputy Seán Barrett seemed to have missed the whole point here.  What we have done this year is that we have not touched mortgage interest relief or VHI insurance relief.  I agree with the Deputy about that section of people who pay for everything, but they are the two things which are of particular importance to those people and we have not touched them, although we were under considerable pressure from a variety of experts and commentators to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On this group of Financial Resolutions I should like to deal first with Financial Resolution No. 17 on value-added tax.  There is much rhetoric on budget day but in anything I say about this, I may, if anything, be understating the position.  I understood there was a commitment over the past four years or so that changes in VAT rates operated within their own loop, to use the kind of computer terminology, and that any increases in a rate would be dedicated to a reduction of the standard rate.  The expectation was widespread that the Minister would increase the 12.5 per cent rate across a tranche of items to 15 per cent or 16 per cent.  Eventually he increased it to 16 per cent.  Everybody, both in here and outside, from the professions and in business, expected that yield to be dedicated to a reduction of the 22 per cent to 21 per cent downwards, perhaps to 19 per cent.  It is a total breach <Col N="536" /> of trust and of the spirit of what the Minister's predecessor said in the House to increase the 12.5 per cent rate to 16 per cent and to transfer the yield out of the VAT loop and use it for other purposes in the budget.  That is outrageous. The only circumstances that changed were that last year Mr. John Major's Government in the United Kingdom increased their standard rate of VAT to 17.5 per cent, rendering the task of the Irish Government in harmonising with our nearest neighbours easier.  It appears to me that again we are being led by the nose by the British.  There is the disposition in this country to proclaim our independence to high heaven in the loudest and most strident way but then to ape the British at every chance we get. It appears to me now that the Minister and his Department have reneged on the commitment to bring the standard rate of VAT down significantly, simply because the British raised their rate.</P>
      <P>The studies on leakage of trade across international boundaries would suggest that plus or minus 2.5 per cent on a VAT rate would not lead to any leakage.  On that basis if, next year, the Minister brings the top rate of VAT down to 20 per cent, and the British hold their rate as it is, there will be no leakage and he will achieve that prevention of leakage of trade but it is not harmonisation.  In the interests of job creation I would suggest a significantly lower standard rate of VAT would have a major impact on commercial and business life.  Yet there is here a major missed opportunity.  This reverts to the discussion we had on the last group of Financial Resolutions. Again this is ideologically-driven; the Progressive Democrats would not give on their pigheaded attitude towards marginal rates of income tax and that had to be funded when it could not be funded from the abolition of reliefs within the income tax code.  Therefore there is a transfer of resources arising from a more stringent imposition of indirect taxation dedicated to a reduction in the marginal rates of income tax.  Certainly it is bad economics; perhaps it is also bad politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter to which I object is <Col N="537" /> that there was a commitment on all sides of this House that we would simplify the VAT code and, in line with our European partners, we would go for two rates; we would have a standard rate at a harmonised level, of something around 15 to 17 per cent and we would have a lower rate on socially or politically sensitive items coming in between 4 per cent and 9 per cent; that was Government policy. Look what has now happened.  Instead of moving towards two rates we have moved in the opposite direction.  We now have six rates.  For example, there is a zero rate, a 2.7 per cent rate for the agricultural community; a 10 per cent rate; a 12.5 per cent rate; a 16 per cent rate and a 21 per cent rate.  How does that comply with the commitments given by the Minister's two predecessors to simplify the code, to harmonise the levels in line with our European partners and end up with two rates, a lower and a standard rate?  This defeats all reason.  It is an extraordinary complication of the VAT code.  Indeed it is a robbing of the resources of the VAT code which should be properly dedicated to reducing the 21 per cent rate to be used for other purposes.</P>
    <P>It is an absolutely outrageous proposal on any grounds, on fiscal, economic and, I would suggest, on political grounds.  If there was to be anything in this budget to generate activity which would lead to extra employment it would seem to me to be to reduce the standard rate of VAT by, say, two points.  The budget is mildly expansionary.  The Minister is spending a little more than twice the rate of inflation but the manner in which that spending is taking place will not generate any extra demand.  This was an area within which there was a possibility within our economy to generate extra demand by reducing the standard rate of VAT.  The Minister has missed that major opportunity which has been a great mistake.</P>
    <P>With regard to credit cards, we were over this hill before when Commissioner MacSharry was Minister for Finance &mdash; I forget what was the then imposition, I think it was £10.  It is now £2.  Two pounds is not very much but it does run counter <Col N="538" /> to the stated intention of both the Government and banking community to move towards a greater use of technology in the dispensing of cash in particular. The cash card is carried by many students.  While £2 may not be much of an imposition on a cash card carried by a student I have an objection in principle to it because, in many circumstances, students are compulsorily required to carry an ATM card.  The European Social Fund grants to regional colleges &mdash; which will henceforth be means-tested under another contrary decision on the part of the new Minister for Education, a silly decision which is another day's work &mdash; are paid through banks and recipients of those grants are required to have an ATM card.  It is peculiar.  I cannot see where is the gain.  Two pounds does not appear to be an enormous yield.  When the charge was introduced previously there was a feeling that the banks were not paying sufficient by way of the bank levy and it was another way of taking a skim from them but, of course, the banks would pass it on to the consumer anyway when issuing the cards.</P>
    <P>On this occasion a major section of the budget is dedicated to commitments by the Minister to replace the bank levy with a more equitable regime of corporate tax which would apply to the banks.  A large section of the budget speech deals with this matter and, in the meantime, the banks will pay an amount by way of bank levy which will not be less than what they are paying at present.  I approve of that. Levies and so on are short term measures and it is better to get them into the general corporate code.</P>
    <P>I note the banks are also being charged for security which is being provided by the Army and the Garda Síochána &mdash; the yield is expected to be £2 million &mdash; for the secure transport of cash around the country.  That is fine by me also.  I cannot understand why this other niggly item has been included, the suggested yield from which is £2 million.  People may have five or six more cards and when that is multiplied by £2 it is not big money.  I have doubts about the wisdom of the decision especially in so far as it relates <Col N="539" /> to students and if it will inhibit the movement towards a cashless society in any way for all sorts of reasons of security as well as for ease of commercial transactions. The other items, so far as I am concerned, are Finance Bill items which I intend to return to when we debate the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (2) to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>I agree with many of the sentiments which Deputy Noonan brought to bear on Resolution No. 17 which deals with VAT.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to delete paragraph (a) of subsection (2).  It focuses on the area of the proposal to increase VAT on certain goods from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent.  The purpose of tabling the amendments is to highlight the fact that far from making progress towards the VAT approximation, which the Minister talked about in his speech, we are going in the opposite direction.  I forgot about the special 2.7 per cent rate for farmers and so on but, as Deputy Noonan said, we now have a 10 per cent rate on construction, newspapers, hotel accommodation and so on; a 12.5 per cent rate on domestic energy products, meals, certain kinds of entertainment and so on; a new rate of 16 per cent and on luxury items a rate of 21 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to be a fantastic reversal from the trend I understood we were engaged on, one which was chartered out by the previous Minister for Finance, and is required by our obligations under the tax approximation regulations, rules and guidelines laid down by the EC.  It is part of the three card trick the Minister has been forced to engage in in order to meet the obsessional benchmarks laid down by the Progressive Democrats on the question of the tax rates applying in the personal income tax code.  It will take the average man and woman in the street some time to do the full sum but the apparent tax relief on personal income tax must be set off against the additional <Col N="540" /> costs in the areas we disposed of in the previous tranche of resolutions and now under this group of resolutions.  The VAT imposition without any diminution in the top marginal rate is a serious factor to be taken into account in that equation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the limitation of time and I will be as brief as possible. I join with Deputy Noonan and The Workers' Party, who have tabled amendments, in opposing Resolution No. 17. This is not the only change in VAT that will be made during the year.  In his contribution the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The bulk of activities currently rated at 12.5 per cent here are, under the terms of the agreements concluded, destined to be liable at the standard rate.  While the adjustment process must be completed by next year, I would not propose to make the transition in one step.</P>
      <P>In that regard there is more to come.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>One important consequence for the Exchequer of the new procedures will be the ending of the payment of VAT at point of entry on imports from within the Community.  This change will entail a cash flow loss for the Exchequer in 1993 of the order of £200 million which cannot be absorbed.</P>
      <P>The adjustments to the standardisation will be made on 1 January 1993 when £200 million will have to be provided. When we recall that the Minister has already deferred some of the payments due under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to 1993, we are talking about significant terms of taxation built into this budget speech, the effects of which will not be felt until next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business community will be affected by the increased VAT rate for cash flow reasons and because of the downturn in trade following the increase in the rate.  Many businesses and shops throughout the country will be hit in a number of ways.  Those in the textile trade will be hit under the new GATT agreement, the increase in VAT here and <Col N="541" /> by the increased cost of vans and delivery and the motor and commercial activities associated with running a business. Already they received substantially increased rate demands from local authorities. In many instances, certainly in Cork Corporation area, the commercial rate was twice that of inflation and in Limerick city it was four times the level of inflation.  There is a limit to the amount business and commercial enterprises can absorb.  They will not be able to absorb all these charges with the result that the cost of these goods will increase significantly more than the 3.5 per cent VAT increase included in this measure.  It will put an upward pressure on wages, our competitive position and on inflation which we should keep within bounds.</P>
    <P>The budget, as the Minister admitted today, will have a 0.3 per cent effect on inflation.  This is a silly proposal particularly when the understanding was that the top rate of VAT would be reduced to an amount that could be paid for by an increase in the lower level.  That has not happened in this case.  This is a clear scam by the Minister to get increased taxation, with more to follow by the further harmonisation measures in the VAT rate next year.  As Deputy Noonan said we will be opposing this measure and for very good reasons.  It is a regressive measure as regards employment here for the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers we are surprised and disappointed at the very substantial increase in the 12.5 per cent VAT rate.  It amounted to an increase of approximately 25 per cent and it will have appreciable downstream implications.  The level of consumer spending has been sluggish and one hoped, in the interests of job creation, that everything possible would be done in the budget to encourage consumer spending and increase employment but the reverse is being done here in relation to a category of goods and services which are of the utmost importance.  One would have thought that a high priority would <Col N="542" /> be given to repair and maintenance services to encourage spending on such services. There is a substantial element of import substitution.  I remember a big deal was made of the concept of reducing the VAT rate on car repairs and maintenance, a very worth-while concept, but here the reverse is being done.  The VAT rate on repair and maintenance services is to be substantially increased.  What effect will this have on employment?  Clearly, the answer is in the negative.</P>
      <P>Where is the concept of converging VAT rates which we were told must happen?  It was my understanding that the standard VAT rate was to be 15 per cent.  It is not a question of taking two bites at the cherry to achieve that rate; we have already exceeded it with this increase to 16 per cent for clothing, footwear, repair and maintenance services, personal services and telecommunications, each very important when it comes to maintaining and creating employment.</P>
      <P>In relation to Financial Resolution No. 20 &mdash; Capital Gains Tax &mdash; the Minister proposes to have one standard rate. I find this rather strange and is a retrogressive measure.  Leaving aside what the yield may be, there seems to have been a reason for the previous regime, in other words, a quick fix, quick killing within a very short period attracted a higher rate of capital gains tax than if the asset was held for an increasing number of years. That seemed a very sensible and logical provision in that it drew a distinction between the person who sold an asset after a number of years and the quick kill merchant.  Yet, for some reason the concept of standardisation is being brought in and the logic behind it escapes me.  There may have been a logic for making adjustments to the rates charged under the previous regime to either increase or reduce them, but to put the quick kill deal on a par with a person who held an asset for years, is a retrogressive step in terms of taxation and is to be deplored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues on this side of the House.  The Minister <Col N="543" /> said he wants to reach the stage where our rates of VAT are similar to those charged by our partners in Europe, and that he prefers to move the rates upwards as opposed to downwards from 21 per cent.  He has decided to increase the rate of 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent at a time when one would have thought the best way to go was to reduce the rate of 21 per cent to, say 19 per cent.  Perhaps a case could be made for increasing the rate of 12.5 per cent towards the figure we have been told will be the standard rate &mdash; which is expected to be between 14 per cent and 16 per cent.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister give the House any information about the increase in the rate of VAT on telecommunications services? In the period leading up to 15 January, Bord Telecom carried out a major public relations exercise.  They announced that the national telephone bill would be cut by £50 million through various changes. These included the introduction of a time limit of 15 minutes per unit in respect of local calls made during peak hours.  Can the Minister say that this increase will not be passed on to the consumers?  Will he ensure that it is not a case of now you see it, now you don't, or despite Telecom Éireann's assertions that our national telephone bill will be reduced, will this increase be passed on?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the VAT on certain entertainment will remain at 12.5 per cent.  Are fun fairs, shows and circuses included here?  Will he ensure that they are not liable to the higher rates of 16 per cent or 21 per cent?  I have no doubt the Minister is aware of the pleasure these fun fairs and circuses give. They are as much an art form as those which have been granted tax exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Noonan, I would like to mention briefly the proposed charge on ATM cards and increases on other services. While these figures are not very high now, there is a tendency to allow these taxes to increase year by year. There is also a danger that employees will ask their employers to pay them in cash.  There has been a move away from <Col N="544" /> cash payments to reduce the risk of robberies and the danger to staff who have to transport large amounts of money to factories and places of employment.  If one makes banking services so expensive for the ordinary consumer, there is a danger employees will ask for cash payments rather than being paid by cheque or having their salaries paid direct into their bank accounts.  I caution the Minister not to look on this as a slush fund or to think he can continue to increase these taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to put it on record that I find this method of dealing with this debate most unsatisfactory. Each time we are presented with a package of resolutions I find myself supporting some and disagreeing with others.  I am sure there must be a better way to deal with this but as I am not party to the way the Whips organise business in the House I had no input.</P>
      <P>I want to deal mainly with Financial Resolution No. 17 but, first, let me refer very briefly to the other resolutions.  I have no problem with Financial Resolution No. 18.  In relation to Financial Resolution No. 19, I agree with Deputy Owen; we want to try to move towards a cashless society.  It is a bit like the curate's egg.  While I have no problem with the proposed increase in the charge on credit cards, I have a problem with the proposed charge of £2 on ATM cards.  We should encourage everyone to have bank accounts and to use cheques and credit cards as much as possible to reduce the risk of robberies.  I ask the Minister to leave that tax alone for a very long time.</P>
      <P>In relation to Financial Resolution No. 20, capital gains tax, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Taylor.  I am not impressed by the Minister's reasons for changing the different rates of tax.  It would be much better to leave them as they are.  I have no problem with Financial Resolution No. 21 which also deals with capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have a serious problem with Financial Resolution No. 17 and I would like formally to support The Workers' Party amendment in respect of <Col N="545" /> the increase in the VAT rate on certain services from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent.  Like other Deputies, I would like to single out repair and maintenance services. For the second year in a row the rate of VAT has been increased in the budget.  Last year it was increased from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent and it is now proposed to increase it to 16 per cent. Deputy Taylor mentioned import substitution and the fact that this sector is labour intensive.  I agree with him, but a further and much more important argument needs to be made relating to the environment.</P>
    <P>The Government have clearly shown in introducing this measure that they do not support the concept of energy saving. Surely the Minister must realise that there is extensive use of energy in the production of capital goods such as a car or a washing machine.  What do we do? We should try to discourage the purchase of new cars and washing machines by encouraging people to repair, renovate and maintain the assets which they already have.  It is also very good housekeeping to try to stretch something but, by this measure, we are going in the reverse direction.  Of course the Government &mdash; and indeed other parties in the House &mdash; are so set on economic growth at all costs that they ignore simple little things like this.  This is a retrograde step to which I am opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a simple matter.  The impact and implications, particularly of Financial Resolution No. 17, are many and the extra value-added tax is contrary to everything we are trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Garland and other Members who have drawn attention to the environmental implications and the efforts which have been made to wean us from being a throw-away society, the idea that when something is broken it is not worth fixing.  From the point of view of Ireland it is a totally negative principle because we do hardly any manufacturing of the kind of services about which we are talking.  There is tremendous pressure on people to throw away goods which can <Col N="546" /> be repaired and to buy new goods, which usually are imported.  The Minister for Finance, as the former Minister for Labour, realises that the whole thrust of job creation cannot and will not be based on manufacturing industry because of the cost and other factors.  The greatest job creation will be in the services industry. We talk about setting up small businesses and in most cases the service industry will supply the jobs.  Entrepreneurial skills and experience can be used in that area.</P>
    <P>This increase will have an effect not only on repairs of household equipment and indeed the house but also on hairdressing and shoe repairs.  What are we doing to the existing businesses?  Instead of helping them to expand and supporting them we are doing away with them. Between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill the Minister for Finance, who knows the job creation factors, should again look at this matter.  Couples who work outside the home depend on the personal services to which I have just referred.  It means being able to employ somebody to come in to do a job which you do not have the time or skill to do. This proposal will militate against that and will put added pressure on women to try to carry out personal services themselves, which, up to now, they have been able to pay other people to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because most of the points I will raise have been touched on by other speakers.  The increase from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent will particularly affect repairs and maintenance.  Road tax has increased and repairs will also increase.  It was said that the saving of £300 in excise duty would give a boost to the sales of new cars but many people cannot afford new cars. These people will be affected by the increased VAT on repairs; their cars are not a luxury but, in most cases, are for travelling to work.  The increased VAT on clothing and footwear will also affect many ordinary people.  The Minister <Col N="547" /> should clarify what he means by personal services.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that voluntary fund raising organisations must try to raise money for medical equipment because of the constraints in our health budget.  We must respect the fact that the Minister has got rid of the VAT on medical equipment, which is laudable.  I will finish on that constructive note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to answer as many questions as I can.  There is no commitment to the two rates within the Community, the Council has agreed to the possibility of two reduced rates plus the retention of the zero and standard rates.  The standard rate has been reduced by 4 per cent in the last two years, from 25 per cent to 21 per cent.  The logic my predecessor applied was to the gap in relation to the UK standard rate which has now been reduced to 3.5 per cent compared with 10 per cent two years ago.  The differential caused pressure although one does not have to be an expert to realise that some people in the UK would like to have their rates increased further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A cut in the standard rate costs £67 million in a full year, so it is not a simple matter of reducing the band to 15 per cent, 16 per cent or 17 per cent.  Even if we were to do this over a period it would involve a sum of £300 million.  The EC agreements can now be more properly called approximate rather than harmonisation. It is clear that the rate of 16 per cent is transitional and it is better to make a move to the post-1992 standard rate in two steps.  I met various groups to hear pre-budget submissions and they are all aware of the problems.  Our discretion in relation to rates of VAT is constrained by the agreements reached following long negotiations at ECOFIN and EC level. The option of reduced rating post-1992 is available only in respect of a specified list of goods and services.  Personal services, including repairs and maintenance, are not on this list and, therefore, they are destined to be standard-rated after 1992.  The restructuring of VAT rates was <Col N="548" /> agreed last year and will continue this year.  It is a more reasonable approach than one big jump and that is why I proposed the rate of 16 per cent.  Some of the arguments made in relation to its defects would have applied if we had made one jump; the transitional arrangement is more suitable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said that the increase from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent would give rise to a retail price increase of over 3 per cent.  I want to clarify that this increase will add only 0.3 per cent to retail prices.  Many important items are being retained at the 12.5 per cent rate, for example, domestic fuels, restaurant meals and cinema and cabaret admissions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor asked about repairs carried out in garages.  Under EC agreements there will be a standard rate for garage repairs and other services after 1992.  I should add that the motor trade are doing exceptionally well under other elements of the budget, for example, new car excise is being reduced, the excise duty on commercial vehicles is being abolished and the excise on petrol is being reduced.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 15 per cent standard rate, I think I have answered the questions on this.  As has been made clear it is a minimum rate and countries are free to exceed it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen asked about the 12.5 per cent VAT rate on entertainment.  This covers cinemas, <Col N="549" /> touring fun fairs, cabarets and commercial museums.  If we are to fund other elements of harmonisation it is necessary to keep the standard rate relatively high. I ask Deputies who talk about the top rate to remember that 17 per cent of our VAT base is already zero rated and a further 15 per cent of consumption is VAT exempt.  Therefore, one cannot take away the entire VAT base.  If I was to move the zero rate and the other rates up I would affect items which I do not think anyone would like to see affected.</P>
      <P>I should like to say to Deputy Barnes that unfortunately there was no support among other member states for the option of charging a reduced rate on personal and repair services in the post-1992 regime.  Points were put forward in this regard but there was no support for them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about the 2.7 rate.  This relates only to livestock and is set at the same level as the farmers' flat rate refund.  A uniform rate of 2.7 per cent will enable marts to operate smoothly when dealing both with farmers who are registered and those who are unregistered for VAT purposes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor asked about capital gains tax.  Indexation will ensure that those who have held assets for a long period will continue to pay less tax.  With regard to ATMs, there is no financial resolution on the introduction of a charge for this service.  This is a matter for the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to say in reply to Deputy Garland that I think there is widespread agreement that the VAT system is not the most suitable or appropriate instrument for dealing with environmental issues.  On the last occasion I took questions I spoke at length about the energy tax, the arguments for and against it and the difficulties which would arise.  This issue is still being debated.  Proposals were put forward at the Energy Council in December and at the ECOFIN Council. The experts were asked to examine the viability of an energy tax and how it would operate.  I think this matter will be raised again at the March meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practical effect of the amendments proposed by Deputy Rabbitte would <Col N="550" /> leave the goods and services concerned liable to the 12.5 per cent rate of VAT rather than increase them to the traditional 16 per cent rate.  The cost of such an approach would be £56 million in 1992 and £81 million in a full year.  As I said, under EC agreements the goods and services concerned must, in the internal market, be liable at the standard rate of VAT.  As I outlined in my Budget Statement, I intend to make this transition in two steps rather than one.  I am sure the House will accept in the circumstances that the approach I have put forward in the Financial Resolution is the correct one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to press the amendment in my name.  The Minister has not always addressed questions put to him.  Nobody on this side of the House is arguing for a single jump.  That is not the issue.  If there must be an increase in the standard rate &mdash; I think most of us accept that there must be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The practice has developed in recent years whereby a separate company is used for the purpose of trying to avoid the existing tax regime.

      <P>Given the major issues involved, the Commission has still a number of additional meetings planned before finalising its proposals on the EC's financial perspectives for the period 1993-97. According to my information, these proposals are now expected to be agreed by the Commission on 11 February and will then be forwarded, in accordance with normal procedures, to the Council and the European Parliament.  I expect that the proposals will be based on the successful outcome of the Maastricht Summit and will cover: financial perspectives 1993-97 and new ceiling on EC own resources; reform of Structural Funds for the next round (1994-98); the establishment and endowment of the Cohesion Fund agreed at Maastricht; the follow-up on the new Treaty Article on trans-European new works in transport, energy, telecommunications, and steps to make the Community revenue system more progressive, to reflect more closely the relative prosperity of member states.</P>

    <P>The mandatory off-take regime was imposed in order to keep an operational refinery capacity in Ireland as a security of supply measure.  It would be my intention to continue it so long as it is seen as a necessary element of that security, and <Col N="95" /> I am satisfied that it is.  In the recent Iraq-Kuwait conflict a significant volume of extra crude was imported, for refining at Whitegate if that had proved necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to seeking an upgrade of the Whitegate refinery to enable the refinery to produce oil products at competitive prices.  As I informed the House on 16 October 1991 a particular project has been identified which is currently under examination.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>While considerable sums of money have been expended by my Department in recent years in the promotion of research and development in the area of renewable energy, for the years 1991 and 1992 it has not been possible for my Department to allocate any resources to this form of research due to budgetary constraints.</P>
      <P>However, funds are available for research, development and demonstration in a number of areas including renewable energies under the European Community's &ldquo;JOULE&rdquo; and &ldquo;THERMIE&rdquo; programmes.  As these are Community programmes, the level of financial support secured by Irish projects depends on the total funds available and on the quality of the projects put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the 13 Irish projects approved <Col N="96" /> so far under the &ldquo;THERMIE&rdquo; programme, one concerns a small hydro development with a total investment of approximately £2.2 million.  Under the &ldquo;JOULE&rdquo; programme, 15 Irish projects in the renewables area were approved by the EC Commission in 1990 and 1991, covering biomass, solar energy, wave energy and wind energy.  The total value of these projects is estimated at about £780,000.</P>
    <P>Projects undertaken by companies and institutions under the &ldquo;JOULE&rdquo; and &ldquo;THERMIE&rdquo; programmes normally run for about three years with the EC grant money being disbursed in phases as work progresses.  It is, therefore, not possible for me to say how much is expended on these projects in any particular year.</P>
    <P>The ESB spent £150,000 on its renewable research programme in 1991 and has a budget for 1992 of £120,000.</P>

      <P>All the operations carried out by British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield are a cause of concern to the Government and I have expressed this view in recent correspondence with my United Kingdom counterpart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the emission of krypton 85 gas from the Sellafield reprocessing plant, such emissions have been taking place since operations began at Sellafield in the early 1950s.  Releases of this gas will increase when the new reprocessing complex known as THORP comes into operation this year.  However, I am advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that doses likely to be received by the <Col N="97" /> Irish public from Sellafield's operations will continue to be of negligible proportions. The annual average dose will still work out at less than 1 per cent of the annual dose received by members of the Irish public from naturally occurring sources of radiation.  However, any increase over natural radiation levels is undesirable and I will continue to oppose operations at Sellafield at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>The increase in krypton gas emissions resulting from the THORP operation will not introduce a new dimension to the question of legal action over Sellafield. The Deputy will be aware that I have gone into that matter in some detail in my replies to earlier questions on this particular issue.</P>

I am not aware therefore of any basis on which the activities mentioned could be challenged.</P>
      <P>I have raised this matter with the UK Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. John Wakeham, and also at the EC Energy Council.  Ireland's concerns over Sellafield were reiterated with particular reference to the processing of waste from other countries.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned at UK plans to import spent fuel from other countries for reprocessing at THORP.  When I first learnt of the proposal to reprocess German waste at THORP, I made protests to the UK and German authorities. In particular it was pointed out to the German authorities that they had abandoned the completion of a reprocessing plant in Germany because of environmental concerns, and that it is not acceptable to us for them to transfer the problems associated with reprocessing close to Ireland.  The increased transport of spent and reprocessed fuel and waste particularly if routed through the Irish Sea, with the attendant increased risk of accidents is of considerable concern.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy is to expand national planting to 30,000 hectares in 1993 and to maintain it at this level each year to the year 2000.  Coillte Teoranta's contribution to the achievement of this target will be 14,000 hectares and, having regard to the 12,000 hectares planted by <Col N="104" /> Coillte Teoranta last year, I am satisfied that Coillte Teoranta's role in the overall afforestation effort is showing satisfactory progress.</P>
      <P>It was acknowledged when Coillte Teoranta were established in 1989 that, given the age profile of the transferred forests and projected timber production, Coillte Teoranta would not be in a position to achieve self-financing for a number of years.  For this reason the Forestry Act, 1988, included financial provisions relating to both current and capital expenditure which would allow some Exchequer funding of the company to continue for some time.</P>
      <P>The necessity to provide funding for current expenses was eliminated in 1990, two years ahead of schedule.  In relation to capital development, a provision of £10 million has been included in the 1992 Public Capital Programme which would bring aggregate Exchequer capital funding for Coillte Teoranta to £53 million as against the maximum of £100 million provided for in the 1988 Act.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to indicate precisely when Coillte Teoranta will be able to self-finance its capital development programme but the progressive reduction in Exchequer funding for capital purposes since Coillte Teoranta's establishment suggests that a self-financing position can be achieved in the near future and at considerably less cost than the maximum provided for in the 1988 Act.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Sellafield operations.</P>
      <P>Since I became Minister for Energy I have on every possible occasion expressed my concern and the concern of the Irish people to the UK authorities about (a) reprocessing at Sellafield, (b) proposals for further expansion of activities at the Sellafield plant and (c) nuclear issues in general which might affect this country.</P>
      <P>On 23 July, 1991, following the announcement made by UK Nirex expressing their preference for Sellafield as a disposal site for low and medium radioactive waste, I immediately dispatched officials of my Department to meet with their UK counterparts in London to seek full details of the proposed disposal site.  Our concerns about the proposal were clearly expressed at that time.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, a meeting of the Ireland/UK Contact Group to discuss general nuclear matters, which was scheduled for November last was, at my behest, brought forward to early September as I was anxious to have the Nirex proposal for a repository discussed at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 August 1991 I wrote to Mr. John Wakeham, the UK Secretary of State for <Col N="106" /> Energy, and on 15 November 1991 I wrote to Mr. Michael Heseltine, Secretary of State for the Environment, raising again the question of an independent nuclear inspectorate at EC level to oversee the nuclear industry throughout the Community including Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I raised the Sellafield matter with the British Ambassador when I met with him on 13 November last.</P>
    <P>At the Energy Council meetings held on 31 May and 29 October 1991, which were attended by the UK authorities, I spoke about nuclear energy and its potential environmental difficulties and called for independent verification and inspection safety agreements under Article 35 of the EURATOM Treaty.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise to the Deputy that the British authorities are well aware of our continued fears about nuclear power plants, and in particular those nuclear reactor plants on the west coast which have exceeded their original life span, and which were not in the first instance designed to meet presentday safety standards.  We have been pressing the British Government for the closure of these plants for a number of years.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether there has been a major reduction in the level of forestry planting by private owners in the current planting season; and, if so, the steps he proposes to take to reverse this trend.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current planting season did see a reduction in planned planting due to a perception in the private sector that Commission proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy would lead to higher grants for forestry in due course.  I could not allow the uncertainty engendered by this perception to continue because of the adverse effect it was having on the planting programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly I announced last Friday details of substantial increases in grants <Col N="107" /> for forestry and the forest premium as follows; £2,000 per hectare for broad-leaves up from £1,200, £1,100 per hectare for conifers on enclosed land up from £900, £900 per hectare for conifers on unenclosed land up from £800.</P>
    <P>These increases apply to all afforestation-approved grants since 1 October 1991 for farmers and others in the private sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the forest premium the following changes were made for farmers who afforest all or part of their land: the present off-farm income level for determining the amount of the premium will in future be based on the average industrial wage as published by the CSO, currently £13,900 per annum approximately instead of the present limit of £11,000 per annum; for farmers whose off-farm income limit is below this threshold and in respect of all land planted in excess of 8 hectares, the premium will increase from £86 to £100 per hectare per annum; and the introduction of an annual premium for farmers, including part-time farmers whose income exceeds the new income threshold at a flat rate of £50 per hectare for 15 years.</P>
    <P>There will be no further increases in afforestation grants for the foreseeable future as I am confident that the measures I have announced will lead to a turnaround in private planting and that we will plant in excess of 24,000 ha. in 1992 and achieve an overall target of 30,000 ha. in 1993.</P>

      <P>In addressing the question, I take it that the Deputy means recoverable reserves of natural gas rather than &ldquo;stocks&rdquo;.  Recoverable reserves in this context means volumes of natural gas that are both <Col N="108" /> technically and commercially recoverable under present conditions.</P>
      <P>Two fields, Kinsale Head and Ballycotton Gas Fields constitute Ireland's proven reserves of natural gas.  The latest studies suggest that remaining reserves from the two fields amount to 716 billion cubic feet and that on current projections of utilisation, these reserves will be exhausted early in the next decade.</P>
      <P>I expect at least two exploration wells to be drilled in the Irish offshore this year, targeting oil or gas.  As no other gas discoveries have been declared commercial there are no development proposals for 1992.</P>

I am however being kept informed of developments by the Nuclear Energy Board which has been in close contact on this matter with the UK nuclear installations inspectorate.  The power station has two magnox reactors which are part of a series of ageing magnox reactors in the UK which were not designed to meet modern safety standards. The reactors were shut down in early 1991 by the operator because of <Col N="110" /> concerns that they did not continue to meet the necessary safety standards.  The Government's view is that all magnox reactors should be closed down on the basis that they have major shortcomings compared with modern reactors.</P>

      <P>I have been informed that up to December 1991 loans and grants totalling £549,450 have been approved by the Arigna Fund Enterprise Company from the £1 million fund set up following the publication of the Arigna Task Force report.  This involves 40 projects and the creation of approximately 114 jobs in the area.  To date £302,700 has been paid over in respect of those projects.</P>
      <P>In addition to the enterprise fund, a full-time co-ordinator/facilitator was appointed for 1991 to progress the various ideas in the task force report.  This person's contract has now been renewed for a further year.  The provision of four managed community enterprise workshops for the Arigna area is at an advanced stage and a wide range of retraining programmes for ex-miners was conducted and these will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During last year, a core group in the area has worked with the local communities and State agencies in drawing up a rural development plan for the Arigna catchment area and this was submitted to Brussels for aid under the Leader Programme. I understand from the Minister for Agriculture that the EC Commission will be announcing formal approval for this shortly.  The enterprise fund has also made application to the EC to have the Arigna area designated as eligible for funding from the European Coal and <Col N="111" /> Steel Community which provides assistance for the economic rehabilitation of former coal mining areas following mine closures.</P>
    <P>The promotion of the area for overseas investment in industry and for its natural scenic and tourism amenities is being actively pursued by the relevant Departments and State agencies involved.</P>

      <P>Government policy in relation to mining is clear.  It is in favour of the development of the State's natural resources where this can be achieved in an environmentally <Col N="112" /> acceptable manner.  The criteria underlining this policy are also straightforward. The exploitation of our natural resources in a carefully controlled manner creates both wealth and badly needed employment. It would be irresponsible of Government to neglect the development of our potentially valuable mineral resources given its commitment to strengthening the economic base of the country and addressing in every possible way the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I should stress again, however, that while the Government fully support the development of a mining industry, this is not an unconditional support.  I, as Minister for Energy, will not allow any mining project to proceed unless it can be clearly demonstrated through the environmental impact assessment process that it is environmentally acceptable. On the other hand where a mining proposal meets the very strict environmental requirements which we have laid down every effort will be made to encourage the development and the associated job creation.  Of course, all potential mining projects must also meet the requirements of the local authority planning process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13 December last, I announced my approval in principle to the granting of a foreshore lease to Dingle Skellig Hotel Limited in respect of the proposed reclamation of foreshore at Dingle, County Kerry, for the purpose of construction of a marina and other facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reaching my decision, I accepted the general findings and recommendations of <Col N="116" /> the chairman of the public inquiry relating to the application for a foreshore lease, which was held in Dingle last May in accordance with the provisions of the Foreshore Act, 1933.  In his report to me, the chairman of the inquiry, Mr. Thomas J. McMahon, had recommended that the application be approved subject to agreement on appropriate legal aspects and the following conditions; 1. The preservation and enhancement of the relevant sections of the traditional rights-of-way along the shoreline, between the Town and Hussey's Folly, where they may be affected by the proposed development; 2. The preservation of vehicular access to the foreshore and right-of-way which extends east from the existing public road at the Skellig Hotel; 3. The preparation of a specific marketing study to enable the promoter to satisfy himself as to a meaningful size for the marina, both in the initial and ultimate stages, having regard for the need for the long term requirements of this type of infrastructural development; 4. The preparation of a hydrographic and computer modelling study to determine, among other things, breakwater effects, changes in current patterns on the equilibrium of Dingle Harbour with specific reference to the big bank, the east channel, the main channel and the proposed marina access channel; 5. The preparation of specific site investigations in relation to sub-bottom conditions and having particular regard for the composition of the big bank where it would be traversed by the marina access channel, the area of the proposed marina basin and if/when rock is encountered to establish its characteristics in terms of excavation and the requirements for blasting if this should prove to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the inquiry ruled that each party to the inquiry should bear their own costs.  In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the costs incurred by the Minister for the Marine in holding the inquiry shall be borne by the applicant, the Dingle Skellig Hotel Limited. These costs have been fixed by the Minister for Finance at £49,399.40.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> A copy of the chairman's summary report and recommendations is being supplied to the Deputy.  Copies of the full report are available from my Department at a cost of £5.  Copies of the report and its appendices can be inspected at my Department's headquarters, Leeson Lane, Dublin 2 on request.</P>

      <P>Subhead C of my Department's Vote for 1992 which covers marine research and development contains a provision of £2,400,000 which represents an increase of 140 per cent over the corresponding provision for 1991.  This increase is accounted for by our participation in the STRIDE (Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe) programme.  The STRIDE Programme is a European Community structural initiative funded under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and will have the effect of greatly strengthening the marine research capability in the State both within my own Department and in the participating unversities.  The additional moneys provided under the subhead represent the gross provision required in 1992 for my Department's element of the STRIDE programme of which 75 per cent will be recouped from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead V of my Department's Vote covers the Marine Emergency Service and the 1992 provision of £4,500,000 represents a 105 per cent increase on the 1991 provision of £2,200,000.  As the Deputy may be aware, I have been committed to the restructuring and radical improvement of the marine search and rescue infrastructure of the State and a programme in this connection is now <Col N="118" /> underway in earnest.  The main reason for the increase in 1992 over 1991 is that 1992 will see the first full year cost of the long-range rescue helicopter service now operated for my Department, under contract from Shannon Airport.  Additional costs arise from the implementation of the full programme for Slánú &mdash; the Irish Marine Emergency Services.  Improving capabilities in this area will mean additional equipment costs, additional staff costs and additional training costs and these are similarly provided for in the 1992 Estimate.</P>
    <P>The two programmes which I have outlined briefly are extremely important for my Department and from the national perspective and I have given them my full support as Minister for the Marine. They represent innovation and progress and I am sure the Deputy will support them.</P>

      <P>The company had the unit removed from the shore by helicopter within three days of the occurrence and it is now back in position on site.  I am satisfied that the matter was dealt with most expeditiously by the company and that no escapes of fish took place.</P>

      <P>The Articles of the EC Treaty relating to social policy, Articles 117 to 122, have not been changed.  However, an Agreement, linked to the Treaty through an Annex, was reached by eleven member states on provisions that go further than those in the Treaty.  The United Kingdom is not a party to the Agreement, but it is party to the Protocol which authorises it.</P>
      <P>Under this Agreement &ldquo;working conditions&rdquo; are included among items that are subject to qualified majority voting, rather than being subject to unanimity as in the Treaty.  The separate question of the &ldquo;conditions of employment for third country nationals legally residing in Community territory&rdquo;, which was not provided for in the existing Treaty, is brought within the scope of the Agreement and is included, along with other matters relating to employment, such as social security and social protection of workers, among the items that require unanimity.</P>
      <P>The Agreement between the eleven member states brings the matter of the conditions of employment of third country nationals within the scope of the activities of the institutions of the Community for the first time.  For that reason it is appropriate that unanimity would apply at this stage.  In this regard I should mention that other provisions of the new Treaty relating to conditions for third country nationals, such as immigration, are also subject to unanimity requirements.</P>

The main reason for the increase under this subhead is the fact that the range of services currently offered to Departments by the Central Information Technology Services Bureau at Kilmainham will no longer be provided as of the end of 1993; consequently there is a need for my Department to invest in computer replacement hardware and software for the Passport Office and the Finance Unit.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subhead F (North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation).  The reduction which the Government have been obliged to make in this allocation is a reflection of the seriousness of the current budgetary situation and the need to make savings wherever possible; it in no way implies any diminished appreciation by the Government of the very valuable work being done by the various organisations assisted under this subhead.</P>
      <P>(3)  Subhead C (Support for Irish Immigrant Groups in the US).  The reduction in this allocation also reflects the current difficult budgetary situation as well as changed circumstances in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An allocation of £200,000 was first provided in 1989 to assist welfare groups in the United States working with the large number of Irish immigrants who had at that stage recently arrived and who were without official status.  The provision was continued in 1990 at the same level. Given the fall-off in the numbers emigrating and against the background of recent changes in US immigration legislation, and in particular the introduction of the Morrison visas, the Government anticipate that there will be some reduction in the demand for existing services provided by the welfare agencies in the US and are hopeful that the reduced provision under this subhead will be adequate to assist the agencies in dealing with the situation.  It is, however, <Col N="124" /> intended to keep the situation under close review.</P>
    <P>(4)  Subhead B (Repatriation of Distressed Irish Persons Abroad).  The 1992 allocation under this subhead is the same as the original 1991 Estimates allocation i.e., £96,000.  The 1991 provisional expenditure outturn on this subhead (£240,000) includes substantial costs which arose exceptionally from the repatriation of Irish citizens as a consequence of the Gulf crisis.</P>

      <P>The Government are very concerned about the situation in the Horn of Africa where over twenty million people have been affected by drought and war. The Government have responded to the UN Consolidated Interim Appeal on behalf of the Special Emergency Programme in the Horn of Africa by allocating £90,000 from the Disaster Relief Fund in order to assist displaced persons and refugees in the region.</P>
      <P>This allocation, which was made on 20 December 1991, brought Ireland's overall bilateral emergency assistance to the Horn of Africa since the beginning of 1991 to £1,100,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, the EC has contributed to the UN Appeal.  The EC gave US$12.3 million of which Ireland's share, through the EC Budget, is calculated to be around US$110,000.</P>
      <P>Although there are indications of some improvement in the situation, conditions throughout the Horn of Africa remain very worrying and I therefore shall continue to monitor developments very closely.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case raised by the Deputy, in which connection my Department was contacted informally last December.</P>
      <P>The European Communities' formal relations with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are conducted in the framework of the EC/ASEAN Cooperation Agreement, which deals primarily with economic, trade and development matters.  There is a parallel political dialogue between the Twelve and ASEAN on international issues and on issues of mutual political interest, including general human rights questions.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to raise specific human rights cases in that multilateral forum.  Cases of individual human rights abuses are, as circumstances warrant, taken up by the Twelve directly with the country concerned.  The case referred to by the Deputy has not been raised by the Twelve.</P>

      <P>The Government were concerned to learn of the earthquake which took place in the Yemen on 22 November 1991 and which, according to the latest information available to me, claimed eleven lives and caused widespread damage to housing infrastructure, leaving very many people homeless.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, due to the extremely heavy demands on the Disaster Relief Fund in 1991, the Government were not in a position to assist the victims of the earthquake, either bilaterally or through international organisations.  Information is not available to me on action taken by other EC countries.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question refers to unemployment as defined in the annual Labour Force Survey.  Ireland's demographic profile at present points to an annual increase in the labour force, in the absence of net migration and of change in labour force participation, of the order of 24,000.  Accordingly, there would need to be a net increase in total employment in excess of 24,000, appropriately adjusted to allow for any net migration and/or change in labour force participation compared with 1991, to effect a reduction in the numbers of unemployed, as defined above, from their 1991 level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is, in fact, no such EC proposal at the present time, the question of the increased use of carbon/energy taxation has been discussed as one element in a possible Community strategy to limit CO2 emissions.  No decision has been taken on whether a fiscal initiative is warranted.  It was considered that the Commission should provide a more detailed presentation of the fiscal and economic implications of the proposed strategy both for the Community as a whole and for individual member states. <Col N="129" /> When this presentation is tabled for discussion, my Department will, of course, assist as necessary in evaluating the overall strategy, in particular its economic and taxation aspects.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not available which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be provided. However, using information supplied by the Department of the Environment on applications for relevant certificates received up to 31 December 1991, the Commissioners tentatively estimate that the cost of tax relief arising in 1990 and 1991 could be of the order of £2 million and £9 million respectively.</P>
      <P>In view of the time-lag between the reintroduction of the relief and the incurring of a cost to the Exchequer, it is likely that the corresponding costs for 1988 and 1989 were relatively insignificant.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that red (UK) marked gas oil may not be used in, and green (Irish) marked gas oil may not be used to power, a road vehicle in the State.  Adequate powers exist to deal with any irregularities which come to attention.</P>
      <P>The use of marked gas oil in road vehicles outside the State is covered by relevant EC regulations, which do not at present distinguish between marked and unmarked oil, and by the national provisions of the State concerned.  Under existing Community rules, not more than 200 litres of fuel may be carried in the tanks of vehicles moving between member states without payment of the appropriate import charges.</P>

      <P>The 1991 allocation in respect of a consultancy &mdash; subhead A.2 &mdash; was £10.55 million.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>On 24 June 1991 the EC Council of Economic and Finance Ministers decided that, in the post-1992 harmonised VAT regime, member states would have the option of applying one or two reduced rates, subject to a minimum of 5 per cent, to a specified list of goods and services. This list, which remains to be finalised by Council, included a category for &ldquo;admissions to shows, theatres, circuses, fairs, concerts, museums, zoos, cinemas, exhibitions, libraries and access to television&rdquo;. Work on further defining this list is currently under way.</P>
      <P>The extent to which I can avail of the reduced rate option, and the actual levels of any future reduced rates, are matters for consideration in the light of budgetary circumstances.</P>

    <P>The question of the deployment of existing staffing resources or the engagement of additional staff is, in the first instance, a matter for the Ceann Comhairle. However, I understand that a number of recently promoted audio typists may be called upon on occasion to help out in emergencies.  The proposed extension of the Dáil sitting to include Fridays should not have any effect on the situation as audio typists work a five day week, including Friday.  The current strength is considered adequate in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have received representations in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy and I am satisfied that there is no injustice involved.</P>
      <P>The workers who took early retirement under the 1984 scheme were taxed on an interest free advance in respect of a retirement lump sum which was included as part of the package.  Only payments made under a pension scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners could be regarded as non-taxable.  At the time the payments were made the pension scheme had not been approved.  An application was subsequently made to the Revenue Commissioners to have the pension scheme approved for tax purposes. Approval was given in December 1985 and the tax was refunded.  There was no undue delay on the Revenue Commissioners part in approving the scheme or in establishing the status of the advance.</P>
      <P>The allegation of discriminatory treatment by comparison with other workers has been fully investigated by both the Revenue Commissioners and the Ombudsman and found not to be well founded.</P>

      <Quest>if he will examine the position of persons providing a home help service for the health boards on very low payment to see if they might be exempted from liability for PAYE-PRSI (details supplied) as it is becoming increasingly impractical for many women to continue to provide this very necessary service at present.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The area mentioned in the question for which I have direct responsibility is PAYE.  Here I would point out that home helpers, like any other taxpayer, are liable to income tax only if their total income exceeds the exemption limit.</P>
      <P>For instance, for the tax year 1991-92, a single or widowed person would not have to pay income tax where the total income for the year is not more than £3,400 or about £65 per week.  In the case of a married couple the exemption limit is £6,800 or about £131 per week.  These amounts are increased by £300 for each of the first two dependent children and by £500 for each subsequent child.  A system of marginal relief operates where the total income for the year slightly exceeds the exemption thresholds.</P>
      <P>The PRSI situation is a matter primarily within the competence of the Minister for Social Welfare, with whom I have consulted in the preparation of this reply.</P>
      <P>The position is that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which was agreed between the Government and representatives of employers and trade unions, contained a commitment to extend social insurance cover to part-time workers as a matter of priority.  This was implemented in the 1991 budget by bringing part-time workers earning £25 per week or more into social insurance. As a result, it is estimated that up to 27,000 part-time workers will become entitled to a range of social insurance benefits, including disability benefit, unemployment benefit and pensions.  It would be inconsistent with the commitment already referred to for exceptions to be made for particular groups within this general extension.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an RSI number was allocated to the taxpayer by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The inspector of taxes has no record of receiving an application for a tax-free allowance certificate.  A return of income form (Form 12A) was issued to him on 22 January 1992.  In the meantime the inspector of taxes issued a tax-free allowance certificate granting the minimum allowances on 28 January 1992.  On receipt of the completed return of income form the inspector of taxes will review his allowances and amend the certificate if necessary.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the reliefs available under the disabled drivers scheme established <Col N="137" /> by the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, applicants must satisfy one or more of the following medical criteria: (a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; (b) persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; (c) persons without both hands or without both arms; (d) persons without one or both legs; (e) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the recommendations of the Ordnance Survey office, the following locations were selected for the regional offices: Cork, Ennis, Kilkenny, Longford, Sligo and Tuam.</P>
      <P>The choice of these locations was influenced by the following factors: the advice of the Office of Public Works as to the availability of office accommodation; the existing distribution of the field staff; the survey's work programme and the equitable distribution of staff in accordance with the Government's programme for the establishment of civil service offices in rural locations.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to change these locations.</P>

      <P>Records are not maintained in such a manner as would enable all the information requested by the Deputy to be given in the short time available. However, information in respect of excise duty and value-added tax rates for the period, 1979-91 and corresponding legislative provisions are set out in the following tables:</P>
      <P>Table 1 &mdash; Rates of excise duty on motor vehicles from 1979-1991</P>
      <P>Table 2 &mdash; Rates of value-added tax from 1979-1991.</P>
      <P>In the years 1979 to 1991, motor vehicles imported from non-EC countries were also subject to EC Common Customs Tariff (CCT) duties.  For example, the (non-preferential) rate applicable to motor cars was 11.0 per cent in 1979, reducing to 10.3 per cent in 1985, and remaining at 10 per cent from 1986 to date.  Information on CCT rates applicable to motor vehicles is contained in the relevant statutory authorities viz. Council Regulation (EEC) No. 950/68 of 28 June 1968 (O.J. No. L172, 22.7.1968), as amended; Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 (O.J. No. L256, 7.9.1987), as amended.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy refers to the Official Report of 10 October 1984 information on the rates of duty/tax levied for the period 1960 to 1983 is provided, columns 1957-1972.</P>

      <P>The National Association of Regional Game Councils have advised national parks and wildlife service that they are aware of a witness to the alleged incident but that the witness does not wish to become embroiled in a public controversy.</P>
      <P>It is an offence under the Wildlife Act, 1976 to kill a swan (except under a licence issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service) and where there is evidence of anyone doing so they will be prosecuted. However, we cannot proceed without such evidence.</P>

      <P>The whole thrust of the EC Commission proposals for Common Agricultural Policy reform is to make Community agriculture products more competitive in the international context while bringing markets back into balance and achieving a better distribution of support among farmers.  This is to be done by reducing guaranteed prices and controlling production while, at the same time, providing compensation to farmers by way of direct payments.  The EC Commission view is that the larger scale and more intensive farmers are now in a position to compete even with reduced support and this is reflected in the modulation of the proposed compensation. I cannot accept the EC Commission proposals as they stand and I am pressing for adjustments to ensure they do not have adverse effects on the long term competitiveness of Community farming.</P>

The person named had no entitlement to a milk quota under the EC regulations at that time.  The regulations were however subsequently amended following a European Court judgment and an official application for a Mulder milk quota was received from him in May 1989.  The person named was then allocated a provisional quota and was subsequently allocated a definitive milk quota as a result of this application.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 189 and 208 together.</P>
      <P>In 1988, the Government introduced the tax clearance system in respect of grants, subsidies and similar type payments from State and public authorities. The basic aim of this system is to ensure that individuals who do not meet their outstanding tax liabilities do not benefit from public grants.</P>
      <P>As from 1 September 1991 the tax clearance system was extended to include grant schemes involving EC funds other than payments under the Guarantee Section of FEOGA.  Thus, with this one exception, all public grant schemes are now subject to the tax clearance procedures.</P>
      <P>The procedures only apply where grants over £500 are involved.</P>
      <P>In the case of grants between £5,000 or more, the applicant is required to furnish a current tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In the case of grants between £500 and £5,000, the applicant must: (i) indicate the tax district dealing with his/her tax affairs; (ii) furnish his/her tax reference number; and (iii) indicate that, to the best of his/her knowledge, his/her tax affairs are in order.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200 and 203 together.</P>
      <P>An organic farming unit was set up in my Department in 1990 to develop all aspects of organic farming.  To date this unit has been allocated £950,000.  The following initiatives have been supported: (i) the establishment of an organic farming module in UCDs degree course; (ii) the establishment by Teagasc of an organic research and development programme at Johnstown Castle and a training demonstration unit at Kildalton College; (iii) a market survey by CBF on the market at home and abroad for organic meat; (iv) a SFADCo programme to develop organic farming in its areas; and (v) development by the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association (IOFGA) of its organisational structures.</P>
      <P>In addition the unit has produced an information leaflet and, with Teagasc, a video on organic farming.  A pilot scheme of grant aid for investments in organic farming enterprises was completed in 1991.  Some £88,000 was paid to 32 organic producers, co-ops and firms under this scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to organic pig production, there are at present no standards contained in Council of Europe conventions or European Community or domestic legislation.  However, the EC Commission is committed to bringing forward proposals on organic animal production by 1 July this year.  I expect that standards for organic pig production will be included in the Commission's proposals.</P>

      <P>The special beef premium scheme did not commence until 1987.</P>
      <P>The number of applications that were approved for payment under the schemes in County Limerick for the years 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990 were 4,154, 2,937, 3,347 and 3,539 respectively.  Statistics were not kept for 1987 and 1988 on numbers refused but 103 were refused in 1989 and 156 in 1990.  The refusals arose because the applicants failed to comply with the EC Regulations governing the scheme and each applicant refused premium was given the specific reason at the time.</P>
      <P>The number of applications received for the scheme in Limerick for 1991 is approximately 3,800.  The processing of these applications is taking place at present and it is not possible at this stage to indicate how many are likely to be approved.</P>

      <P>(iii)  Subhead G3 &mdash; Industrial Development Authority &mdash; Building Operations.</P>
      <P>(i)  Subhead M: In comparison with most of our community partners, and many of the countries with which we compete on international markets, Ireland has lagged behind in capital investment in the support system for technological development and in expenditure on research and development.  In recognition of this, the science and technology programme was initiated in 1987, with the intention that, within the limited resources available, the funding would be increased with a view to developing the level of technological capability necessary to underpin the competitiveness and more rapid development of Irish industry.</P>
      <P>Of the 1992 allocation, £24 million is in respect of committed expenditure on existing measures, with the balance for expansion of existing measures, including graduate placement and technology transfer, and for new activities, including new programmes in advanced technologies.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Subhead J1: This relates to the export credit insurance scheme under which, in accordance with the Insurance Act, 1953 (as amended) claims are met by advances from the Central Fund which is subsequently repaid out of my Department's Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> The 1992 Estimate provision is to recoup the Central Fund in respect of net claims paid between 1 April 1990 and 31 March 1991.</P>
    <P>The increase relates principally to an exceptional level of payments of bank guarantees during the period referred to.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Subhead G3: IDA's property budget has been relatively small in recent years, reflecting the fact that the emphasis has shifted more to encouraging private sector provision of industrial space requirements.  This shift in emphasis will continue in 1992.</P>

      <P>The increase in the allocation for subhead P4 &mdash; Grant for the social employment scheme &mdash; of my Department's Vote is being provided because the scheme will not, in 1992, be eligible for European Social Fund assistance, which amounted to approximately £12 million in 1991.  The scheme is therefore being funded in 1992 totally by the Exchequer.  There are of course compensating savings on the Social Welfare Vote as all persons on the scheme come from the live register.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the reduction in the allocation for subhead P3 &mdash; FÁS Capital Expenditure (Grant-in-aid) is in accordance with the expenditure schedule which had been projected for the FAS Capital Investment Programme for the years 1990-93 under the Structural Funds Training Infrastructure Programme. That programme envisaged that FÁS capital expenditure would peak in 1991 and decrease for the remaining two years of the programme.  The 1992 allocation is in line with the scheduled reduction for 1992 and current budgetary constraints.</P>

      <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal made awards to the employee concerned against the employer under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  To date the employer has failed to pay the awards to the employee and the employee referred the matter to my Department in October 1991.  Under the provisions of the representative Acts, the <Col N="194" /> Minister for Labour may institute proceedings for the recovery of such sums from a defaulting employer.  I am prepared to exercise this discretion and to pursue, subject to legal advice, the employer concerned for the sums owing. In this connection, papers in the case have been submitted recently to my legal advisers for consideration as to the institution of such proceedings.  I have asked my legal advisers to deal with the case as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>The application of the conditions governing the payment of mortgage subsidies by health boards is a matter for the Minister for Health while the Minister for Social Welfare is responsible for the application of the conditions governing the payment of the free fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>I would point out, however, to the Deputy that the basic payments to participants on the social employment scheme are at a higher level than the rate of unemployment assistance in order to compensate participants for the loss of benefits such as mortgage subsidy and free fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>I have noted the recommendations of the IEA 1990 Review concerning a periodic review of pricing practices of the State energy industries.</P>
      <P>I am naturally concerned with the area of gas pricing policy, and the level of gas prices is kept under continual review by my Department.  However, I do not see the need for a public review of gas pricing practices at this time, as suggested by the IEA.  This is an option that I will keep in mind should the need arise.</P>

      <P>(1)  Subhead C: The 30 per cent increase is required to provide the Geological Survey with the necessary computer and printing hardware for a basic capability in digital cartography.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subhead E: The 44 per cent reduction is due to the completion of a special project in energy conservation for which particular additional funds had been made available under the Government environmental action programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Subhead I: The 40 per cent reduction is due to the fact that the private bog development scheme was terminated with effect from 13 October <Col N="196" /> 1987 and the provision remains to meet declining outstanding commitments.</P>

      <P>The recently published report of the Industrial Policy Review Group suggested that the price of milled peat to the ESB should be lowered.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that at current energy prices, the price of milled peat is higher than comparative costs for other fuels. Bord na Móna is in the process of implementing a major restructuring programme with a view to improving efficiency and reducing costs.  Achievement of increased profitability should over time provide a basis for reducing the cost penalty associated with generating electricity from peat.</P>
      <P>The review group also suggested that a task force be established to follow up on the implementation of the recommendations made in the report.  The Government has decided to establish a committee to undertake this task and my Department and I will co-operate fully with this committee.  The implications of the report for all areas under the aegis of my Department will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Subhead B of the Vote for Social Welfare (No. 40) refers to the contribution by my Department towards the cost of computerising An Post's counter services which will take a number of years to complete.  A start was made on this in <Col N="223" /> 1991 when a pilot project was undetaken. Based on the anticipated rate of development of the work during 1992, it is estimated that a sum of £3 million will be required.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subhead L refers to the carers allowance scheme.  The scheme was initially introduced on 1 November 1990 for persons providing full-time care and attention to elderly and invalided social welfare pensioners and was extended to carers of persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance from July 1991.  The 1992 estimate is £10.4 million.  The increase of 68 per cent over 1991 expenditure is due mainly to projected higher level of recipients in 1992 and to the extension of the scheme to recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>(3)  Subhead K refers to the family income supplement scheme.  Significant improvements have been made in this scheme in recent years.  The 1992 estimate is £11.6 million.  The increase of 13 per cent over expenditure in 1991 is due mainly to the full year costs in 1992 of the major improvements granted in the 1991 budget.  These include (a) increases in the income limits for receipt of payment, (b) abolition of the restrictions on the amount payable based on family size, and (c) payment to families with children over 18 and under 21 years in full-time education.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme is intended to <Col N="224" /> help households who are dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
      <P>An applicant for a fuel allowance must satisfy a means test to fulfil the conditions that he is unable to provide for his own heating needs.  A recipient of a contributory social welfare pension is regarded as being unable to provide for his heating needs if he and members of the household in which he resides have income of not more than £5 per week in addition to the social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The person in question does not qualify for the allowance as he has means, in addition to his social welfare contributory pension, of some £28 per week from an occupational pension.  A brother and sister living in the same household are treated in relation to this condition no differently from a married couple in the same situation.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was refused retirement pension in July 1990 as his yearly average of 17 contributions from 1955 to 1990 was too low to satisfy the minimum contribution conditions of the scheme. His low average is attributable to the fact that there is no record of contributions on his behalf for the year 1957 and from 1959 to 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned subsequently provided additional information regarding his employment during these periods. However, following extensive investigations by the social welfare officer in June 1991, it was determined that he was not in insurable employment during those years.  Under current legislation, he has insufficient contributions over his <Col N="225" /> working life to qualify for either a retirement or old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The person concerned might be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension.  An application form for this pension was sent to him in November 1991.  If he completes and returns this application to my Department his entitlement will be examined and he will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

He appealed against this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and he was referred for a further medical examination by a different medical referee and he was again deemed capable of work.  While the claimant may be deemed unfit to continue in the employment of the health board, in acordance with the criteria of the particular health board this would not necessarily preclude him from seeking work elsewhere nor would it preclude work of an alternative nature.</P>
      <P>His case was considered by an appeals officer who held an oral hearing of the appeal.  Having considered all the evidence available the appeals officer disallowed the appeal.  The appeals officer's decision is final and may only be altered in the light of new evidence or facts.  It is of course open to the appellant to submit any new evidence or facts that he wishes to have considered.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the reason for (1) the 15 per cent increase in expenditure under Vote 19, subhead A.1, (2) the 24 per cent increase in expenditure under Vote 19, subhead C.1 and (3) the 10 per cent increase in expenditure under Vote 19, subhead C.2, in the Estimates for Public Services 1992.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 15 per cent increase in subhead A.1 of Vote 19 to which the Deputy refers is calculated by reference to the out-turn figure for 1991 which, due to savings, was less than the amount estimated.  The provision in subhead A.1 is, in fact, only 8 per cent higher than the amount which was included in the 1991 Estimate.  The increase is largely to provide for the cost of pay increases granted last year (which would have been provided for in Vote 44 last year) and also includes provision for incremental increases and an additional payday which will fall in 1992.</P>
      <P>The projected increase in expenditure under subhead C.1 is to meet the cost of higher fees payable to lawyers who operate the criminal legal aid scheme, an anticipated increase in the volume of criminal legal aid cases in 1992 (which is demand-driven and not subject to control by my Department), and additional VAT which is consequential on these increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board, under subhead C.2 is <Col N="232" /> necessary because of the continuing additional costs arising from the expansion of the service in 1991 and, also, the cost of salary increases granted to the board's staff.</P>

Under the circumstances, the question of a grant in the current year does not arise.</P>

      <P>Regulations have not been made under sections 23 or 25 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  A number of regulations are however in operation under the 1987 Act and other legislation in order to ensure the control of atmospheric emissions. These include measures: establishing national air quality standards for a number of common pollutants; providing for the licensing of a wide range of new industrial plant (including oil refineries, large power stations and foundries with a capacity above a specified limit), and specified categories of existing industrial plant; prohibiting the marketing, sale and distribution of smokey coals in the Dublin area; specifying an emission limit value for asbestos from specified industrial plant; and regulating the sulphur content of gasoils, and the lead and benzene content of petrols.</P>
      <P>Further regulations are at an advanced stage of preparation at present; these include measures relating to emissions from existing power plants and from vehicles.</P>

      <P>The environment action programme set out a number of initiatives to encourage a higher level of recycling.  These included <Col N="251" /> the preparation of recycling schemes by local authorities, and the provision of grants for recycling activities.  In addition, the IDA commissioned an examination of possibilities for productive economic activities based on recycling.</P>
      <P>While recycling rates in Ireland are still below those achieved in certain other EC member states, nonetheless considerable progress has been made.  For example, glass recycling has increased from 8 per cent to 20 per cent since 1986 and can recycling has risen in the same period from a position of virtually zero to 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently commissioned a study to assess the overall potential for recycling in this country and to advise on strategies for increasing recycling levels.</P>

The capital allocation in 1991 to Kilkenny housing authorities for local authority house construction was £1,119,000 compared with the 1990 out-turn of £588,000. In addition, the availability of houses through the occurrence of vacancies in the housing authorities' existing stock, the capital provision for the voluntary housing scheme and the various initiatives in &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;, if developed to their full potential by the authorities, constitute a reasonable response to existing housing needs in these areas.</P>
      <P>Figures for local authority house completions in County Kilkenny (including Kilkenny city) are included in the 1988 and subsequent annual bulletins for housing statistics, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>This project is at the initial planning stage only.  The commitment of funds to it would only be considered when detailed design proposals have been approved and the local authority are in a position to accept a tender for the project.  The overall capital allocation for the swimming pool programme and the competing demands of other local authorities for available funds are also factors which will have to be taken into consideration at that stage.</P>
      <P>The present arrangements for the financing of new swimming pools provided by local authorities allow for a capital grant of up to 80 per cent of the cost of the pool, with at least the remaining 20 per cent being financed by way of local contribution.  Swimming pools must be constructed to standards not lower than those set down in the Department's guideline specification for swimming pool construction.  Works carried out to a more elaborate standard than provided for in the specification would not be eligible for a grant in respect of the excess costs.  These arrangements also apply to pools provided by other organisations or bodies where the application is supported by the local authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 341 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> A local authority, in granting planning permission for a factory or other industrial plant, would be expected to have regard to the need for adequate disposal facilities for waste arising in the normal operation of the factory or plant.  It would be unrealistic and unnecessary, however, to require that emergency plans covering water disposal as well as other matters should be required in all cases of industrial activity and there is no such provision in planning law.  In the case, however, of certain industrial activities which are liable to pose a particular risk to public safety in the event of an emergency, the European Communities (Major Accident Hazards of Certain Industrial Activities) Regulations, 1986 (S.I. No. 292 of 1986), as amended, require the persons responsible for these activities to prepare a site emergency plan.  In addition the regulations require the fire authorities and the other emergency services to have plans for dealing with the off site effects of any emergencies in the operation of such industrial activities.</P>
    <P>On the question of planning for emergencies generally, it is a matter for the fire authorities concerned, acting on the guidelines issued by my Department, to make provision for responding to emergencies, including such matters as the removal and disposal of debris.</P>
    <P>The development of waste disposal facilities by local authorities in their own functional areas is exempted development for the purposes of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1990 and does not require planning permission.  However, this development is, in the case of the larger waste disposal facilities, subject to the environmental impact assessment requirements of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990 (S.I. No. 25 of 1990).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a detailed report from the Kildare County Manager on the serious contamination incident in October 1991 which affected part of the Naas drinking water supply.  I have also heard personally on this matter from local interests, who expressed concern at the incident and looked for reassurance about the safety of Naas drinking water.</P>
      <P>In order to respond to these concerns, I have recently co-ordinated the following set of measures, where appropriate in co-operation with the Kildare County Manager.</P>
      <P>The Sunday's Well source, the origin of the October contamination, has been closed off.  Its pumps are also being removed and it will not be used again. All drinking water in Naas now comes from Ballymore Eustace, the largest source in the country.</P>
      <P>The results of all of the regular monitoring carried out by the local authority on Naas drinking water since normal supplies were resumed have been assessed by my Department.  These results show an excellent quality of drinking water: with the exception of one sample taken on 29 October 1991, all comply with national and EC drinking water standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a special measure, extensive independent sampling and analysis of drinking water quality &mdash; principally in the area previously served by Sunday's <Col N="266" /> Well &mdash; was carried out last week by the Environmental Research Unit (ERU) of my Department.  Samples covered both kitchen tap and attic storage tank supplies. In all cases, the independent ERU analysis has shown a high quality of drinking water, with no breaches of any of the ten quality parameters analysed.</P>
    <P>Revised guidelines for the protection of drinking water nationally are being urgently prepared by my Department in the light of the Naas incident and developments generally since the existing guidelines were formulated in 1986.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this forward looking programme will best serve the wider public interest including the people of Naas.</P>

      <P>About one-third of the population in Donegal is supplied from fluoridated water supply schemes.  Because of the geographical nature of the county many areas are served by small water supplies which are unsuitable for fluoridation. Furthermore, many families have private water sources.</P>
      <P>In the Donegal area the North-Western Health Board operate a scheme for the topical application of fluoride to teeth of school-children and for the distribution of fluoride tablets to school-children where public water supplies have not been fluoridated.</P>
      <P>The areas which have not fluoridated water supplies are listed in Table 1.  The areas which currently are provided with a fluoridated supply are listed in Table 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist health boards in extending and upgrading fluoridation schemes my Department have made a special capital grant allocation of £200,000 per annum available to the boards over the past few years.  A similar sum is being provided in the current year.  A number of proposals <Col N="267" /> made by the North-Western Health Board for capital grants from the funds currently available are under consideration by my Department.</P>
    <P>The fluoridation of public water supplies is a major element in this Department's preventive strategy in relation to dental health and studies show that there has been a major decline in the prevalence of caries in Irish school-children since the introduction of the fluoridation programme.</P>

      <P>The position regarding a scheme of improvements involving the relocation of the out-patients and other departments at Mallow General Hospital is under consideration in my Department.  I am aware of the urgency of the matter and my Department will be in touch with the Southern Health Board on the matter.</P>
      <P>There are currently no proposals for additional posts to staff the casualty unit of Mallow General Hospital before my Department.  Each health board is responsible for determining the staffing needs of the individual hospitals under its management and for establishing priorities for the allocation of staff within the approved employment ceiling for the board.  I understand that the staffing situation in Mallow General Hospital is being kept under review by the Southern Health Board.</P>

      <P>Subheads J.1 and J.2 of the Health Vote represent the Exchequer provision in respect of building, equipping and furnishing of health facilities.  Total funding for this purpose, within the public capital programme, may from time to time be provided from a combination of Exchequer funding and other sources, such as from internal resources or through borrowing.  Such was the case in 1991.  However, all health public capital programme expenditure in 1992 will be met from within the Health Vote.  The increase in subheads J.1 and J.2 in 1992 therefore reflects the increased proportion of total health expenditure under the public capital programme which is being met from Exchequer and lottery sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead K, which covers Appropriations-in-aid of the Health Vote <Col N="271" /> reflects increased revenue which results from the removal of the income ceiling on health contributions, and also includes anticipated capital receipts of £2 million. The subhead provision also takes account of the Government's macro-economic projections in respect of national income for 1992.</P>

      <P>Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers health boards to provide support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
      <P>The role of the voluntary committee in the home help service is to provide a service, on the health board's behalf, to those persons requiring care and assistance at home so that they can continue to live independently within the community. To this end, the committee act as the employer of the home help organiser(s) and the staff.  The committee must also maintain an overview of the service within their area, ensuring that the service is effective, flexible and responsive to the needs of the community.</P>
      <P>In addition to ensuring that a high quality service is provided, the committee must ensure that adequate systems of financial control exist for receipt and disbursement of funds, and that an annual audit of the committee's financial affairs is carried out.</P>

    <P>As a voluntary group, the home help committee will normally delegate a number of their functions to the home help organiser, particularly in the area of payment of wages, assessment and collection of charges for the service, and day-to-day liaison with other community services.  The committee, however, retain their responsibility for ensuring the quality and scope of the service through regular <Col N="273" /> consultation with the organising staff and the local statutory services.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated the Government's <Col N="276" /> commitment to the Tallaght hospital project.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will be aware that I recently met with the Tallaght Hospital Board and the various local interest groups for discussion regarding the project.</P>
      <P>I am also actively exploring all possible funding options and in this context I have recently asked the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group to examine the hospital needs of the area, to make recommendations on possible methods of funding and to report back to me within six months.</P>

      <P>Fifteen of the 18 members of St. James's Hospital Board are appointed on the nomination of various interested bodies such as the Eastern Health Board, St. James's Hospital, Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals and Trinity College.</P>
      <P>The chairman and two other members of the board, one of whom must be an officer of my Department, are appointed by me.  In considering whom to appoint, I was particularly conscious of the fact that the restructuring proposals for the eastern region have yet to be implemented and it was primarily for this reason that I concluded that the board would best be served by reappointing the three outgoing members for a period of one year only.</P>
      <P>I will also be bringing the recommendations of the Commission of the Status of Women to the attention of all nominating bodies.  I will, of course, continue to bear the recommendations of the commission in mind when I am considering appointments to boards.</P>

      <P>The Asthma Society of Ireland has prepared a three year development plan which incorporates an integrated series of programmes on various aspects of asthma, including information, awareness, self-help and research.  The plan is expected to be launched in May of this year.  Given the importance of this initiative the health promotion unit of my Department as part of its support programme for voluntary organisations with a health promotion remit invested £5,000 in the plan in December 1991.  This support was in respect of the development of information materials which are an important feature of the plan.  Similar support was also provided to the society in previous years.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will be aware the reported incidence of viral meningitis increased considerably in 1990 over the 1989 figure.  As this form of meningitis can be precipitated by viruses such as influenza, the increase was probably associated with the outbreak of influenza in late 1989 early 1990.</P>

    <P>The Department of Health monitor the incidence of bacterial meningitis in two ways: through the weekly reporting of cases by general practitioners to the local director of community care /medical officer of health (DCC/MOH) who, in turn, reports the cases to the Department <Col N="287" /> and reports on individual cases of bacterial meningitis are submitted by the local DCC/MOH to the Department.</P>
    <P>These reports in recent years have not indicated any major outbreak or clustering of cases or particular possible sources of infection.  The pattern of infection has been of sporadic cases occuring in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Department operate a control programme, in conjunction with the health boards and primary care doctors.</P>
    <P>The appearance of a case of bacterial meningitis indicates to the local health service the presence of infection in the area.  The DCC/MOH then liaises with local GPs to create a clinical awareness of the presence of infection.  This is important because, in the more pernicious types of infection, the prognosis will depend on early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Prophylactic therapy is also initiated for the family and immediate contacts of cases.</P>
    <P>Research on an appropriate vaccine is taking place internationally and the Department are monitoring this as a basis for the possible introduction of a vaccination programme into this country.</P>

      <Quest>if she will change the basis upon which funds are allocated, through the health boards, towards the running costs of hospitals from a system of allocations being based on historic levels of allocations in previous years, to a system of allocation based on the activity levels of individual hospitals and the relative efficiency of different hospitals in carrying out procedures.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health do not strike allocations for individual health board hospitals.  A single allocation is made to each board in respect of their overall services, and it is a matter for the board to determine the appropriate budget for each of their hospitals.  Although the current allocation methodology is largely <Col N="288" /> incremental, account is taken of changes which are specific to individual health boards; for example, the commissioning of a new facility.</P>
      <P>However, it is generally accepted that a more appropriate allocation methodology is required, particularly in relation to acute hospitals.  In this regard detailed study is continuing into the use of case-mix data as a basis for allocating resources.  The Deputy will appreciate that given the wide variety and complexity of services provided in hospitals, it is a different task to measure output for comparative purposes.</P>
      <P>In addition, the case-mix measurement techniques available at present relate to in-patient activity only and do not take account of the very considerable level of work undertaken on an out-patient basis. Notwithstanding these difficulties, I expect that costed case-mix data will in the future influence the determination of allocations.  It will, however, be necessary to effect the change on a carefully phased basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 385 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> Segregation of hospital waste into clinical and non-clinical components is an important element of waste disposal policy and is an operational matter for the hospital authorities.  The techniques mentioned by the Deputy as possible alternatives to incineration have been investigated and may play a part in the disposal of clinical waste.  Unfortunately, none of these techniques is suitable for disposal of the totality of clinical waste.</P>
    <P>Reduction at source, and recycling, where appropriate, of non-clinical hospital waste would be desirable and I will ask the hospitals to examine their viability.  However, the plastics component of clinical waste is unlikely to reduce.</P>
    <P>Plans are at an advanced stage for the provision of a central incinerator to safely dispose of the clinical waste from all the Dublin hospitals.  Tenders have been sought from contractors who would supply, install and operate an incinerator to the highest standards.  Heat recovery and flue gas scrubbing are included.  It is not possible at this stage to say what the annual cost will be.</P>
    <P>The location in respect of which tenders are being sought is St. James's Hospital.  The proposal will be subject to an environmental impact study and the seeking of planning permission and a licence to operate from Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>The site for the disposal of debris containing meat in County Westmeath from the plant referred to was visited by officers of the Midland Health Board who inspected the disposal operation and ensured that good hygiene practices were in place.  They were satisfied that there was no interference from ground animals, attraction of vermin or nuisances arising from smells and so on.  It is reported that this continues to be the situation.</P>
      <P>In the longer term the Midland Health Board have undertaken a water sampling programme, to assess the quality of water in the disposal site area.  Tests reported to date have shown no negative outcomes. Water samples from a number of local wells and streams will continue to be tested on an ongoing basis for as long as is necessary to ensure there is no risk to public health.</P>

      <Quest>if, having regard to her reply to Parliamentary Question No. 132 on Tuesday, 5 November 1991, she will clarify the position with regard to those people who applied for disabled person's maintenance allowance prior to 21 July 1991 and were entitled to this in their own right but did not receive it at the time.</Quest>

      <P>As my predecessor indicated in response to a question from the Deputy on 5 November last, the regulations governing disabled person's maintenance allowance were changed from 21 July 1991 to bring the method of calculating the allowance payable to a disabled person whose spouse is in receipt of a social welfare payment into line with the arrangements that apply to spouses under the social welfare system generally.</P>
      <P>The effect of the regulations is that the total amount payable to couples in such cases is limited to the equivalent of one full personal rate and one adult dependant rate.</P>
      <P>In relation to a person who had applied for DPMA before 21 July 1991 and whose spouse was in receipt of a social welfare payment, the regulations provide that that person shall be paid in the manner described above unless he or she had before 21 July 1991 specifically claimed any additional amount over and above that rate of payment.</P>

      <P>Students starting on ESF-aided courses in September will not be required to pay fees.  Maintenance grants will be paid subject to means testing.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate the number of families which will be affected by the introduction of means-testing of ESF maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The number of students on ESF programmes in 1991 was 22,200 whereas the number for which funding was available from Brussels was 19,600.  In the interests of equity the emphasis on student grant support must be on helping those from the lower income group to participate in third level education/training programmes. Within the limits of available resources it will be possible to accommodate more students through the application of means-testing.</P>
      <P>The provision for the payment of grants and scholarships to students of vocational education committee colleges is £41.833 million in 1992, this represents an increase of 16 per cent on the amount spent in 1991.  This is a result of the greatly increased intake of students into the vocational education committee sector colleges.  The introduction of means testing is one of the mechanisms being introduced to enable this growth in student numbers to be supported.</P>

      <P>(1)  The increase of 46 per cent in the provision for special services for children in care is mainly to provide for the full year operating costs of the new Oberstown Boys' Centre and the new unit at the Oberstown Girls' Centre which were opened on a phased basis in September 1991, and will be fully operational in early 1992.</P>
      <P>(2)  The increase of 25 per cent in the allocation for the capital building and equipment costs of special schools for children in care is due mainly to the provision for a new girls' centre at Finglas.</P>
      <P>(3)  The increase of 16 per cent for grants to vocational education committees in respect of grants and scholarships to students is due mainly to the rapidly increasing numbers on ESF aided programmes in the vocational education committee colleges.  It also allows for the continued index-linking of maintenance grants in September 1992.</P>
      <P>(4)  The increase of 49 per cent for building grants and capital costs of regional and other technical and specialist colleges under vocational education committees is due to the ongoing commitment by the Government to increasing facilities in the colleges in line with the growth in third level student numbers and to ensuring that college programmes remain relevant to the needs of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Projects in 1992 include developments at Tallaght RTC, Bishop Street, College of Catering, Cathal Brugha Street, Athlone RTC, Carlow RTC, Cork RTC, Dundalk RTC, Galway RTC, Letterkenny <Col N="300" /> RTC, Limerick CoAct, Sligo RTC, Tralee RTC and Waterford RTC.</P>
    <P>(5)  The increase of 129 per cent to the Higher Education Authority for building grants and capital costs for universities and colleges and designated institutions of higher education (grant-in-aid) is indicative of the continuing commitment of the Government to the provision of increased student places at third level and to improving resources which will contribute to the transfer of technology between colleges and industry.</P>
    <P>Projects in 1992 will include developments at Dublin City University, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, Trinity College, Dublin, University College, Cork, University College, Dublin, University College, Galway and at the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>(6)  The 22 per cent increase in Appropriations in Aid is due mainly to an increase in receipts from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>Receipts from the European Social Fund in any calendar year in respect of a range of vocational training programmes provided by the Department normally consist of advance payments of 80 per cent of aid due for the year in question plus final payments of 20 per cent of aid due for the previous year.  However, some variations may occur from year to year in the speed with which individual claims for aid are processed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The 1992 abridged allocation included an additional £15.094 million as a result of an anticipated delay in receipt of aid due in 1991.  In the event, a substantial portion of the 1991 receipt expected to be delayed was in fact received late in 1991.  This will cause a significant change in the year on year comparison in the post-budget Estimates volume.</P>

      <P>Tuition fees are a standard feature of the funding of higher education in this country.  Accordingly, each institution receives a fee in respect of each student, either directly from the student or indirectly through one of the student support schemes.  This requirement applies to all students including those taking part in the ERASMUS programme.</P>
      <P>The ERASMUS programme is an EC programme which encourages students in third level institutions to pursue some of their studies for a period of up to one year in another member state.  The EC through the Higher Education Authority gives a grant towards the travel and maintenance costs incurred by Irish students participating in the programme.  Irish students who avail of the programme pay tuition fees to their home institution but incur no tuition fees to their host institutions in the EC member state.  Likewise students from member states who pursue part of their studies in an Irish third level institution under the ERASMUS programme do not pay tuition fees to the host institution.</P>

      <P>The Rules for National Schools provide that schools must be open not later than 9.30 a.m. and formal instruction should commence not later than 9.50 a.m.  The position regarding the operation of the school timetable is that essentially this is a matter for the board of management of each individual school who have provision within existing rules and timetable requirements to make suitable arrangements regarding starting times having consideration for transport arrangements generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have not received submissions in the matter, I would not consider it appropriate to withdraw this measure of <Col N="312" /> discretion by requiring schools to open at specified times.  The present regulations allow schools discretion, therefore, to meet their own local conditions.</P>

      <P>There are three post-primary schools in Portlaoise town with a total enrolment in the current school year of 1,103 pupils. Major building projects had been mooted for two of the schools &mdash; the CBS and the vocational school.  In accordance with standard practice, discussions were initiated with the school managements on the issue of rationalisation.</P>
      <P>The need for rationalisation has been accepted by the managements of all three post-primary schools in the town and discussions and consultations among all the interested parties, including parents and teachers, have been conducted at local level in recent years.  My predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, had separate meetings with representatives of the managements with a view to encouraging local consensus and agreement on the future provision of post-primary facilities in Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, however, such local consensus did not emerge and, following full consideration of all aspects of the matter, she decided last August to engage independent consultants to undertake a study of the required post-primary provision in Portlaoise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the consultants is <Col N="313" /> awaited.  A decision on the future provision for post-primary education in Portlaoise will be made in the light of the findings of the report.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 433 and 434 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware a decision has been taken to amalgamate the three post-primary schools in Caherciveen and the vocational school, Waterville, into a single school &mdash; a community college under County Kerry vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>The management of the Christian Brothers school in Caherciveen is party to this agreement.  However, due to falling enrolments, the trustees of this school have now informed my Department of their intention to close their school within a time scale yet to be decided by them.</P>
      <P>As the school is a voluntary secondary school, the question of closure is a matter to be decided upon solely by the Christian Brothers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's responsibility is to ensure that the decision to provide a single post-primary school, a community college, in Caherciveen is fully implemented.  In this regard, the current position is that County Kerry vocational education committee has been authorised to purchase a site for the school. Recently, the vocational education committee queried the number of pupil places sanctioned for the long term need in Caherciveen. My Department are currently reviewing the projected figure, in the light of the arguments put forward by the <Col N="316" /> vocational education committee, that the long term provision should be higher.</P>

      <P>Provision of £8 million was made in the Vote for Defence for 1991 for the upkeep and improvement of military barracks and posts.  The provision was expended on the most urgent works as recommended by the military authorities.  Ordinary maintenance works only were carried out at Connolly Barracks, Longford, during that year.</P>
      <P>A provision of £8 million is similarly included in the Defence Estimate for 1992.  The more urgent works required in the various barracks, including Connolly Barracks, will be carried out within the resources provided.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to alter the present status of Connolly Barracks.</P>

      <Quest>the reasons a deduction is still being made from the pension of an ex-soldier (details supplied) in County Limerick on the grounds that he is also in receipt of an Army disability pension even though he has now lost his disability pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Following his discharge from the Defence Forces in July 1988, the person in question was granted a service pension under the Defence Forces (Pensions) schemes. He was subsequently granted a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of disablement due to injury. He had also instituted a civil action against the Minister in respect of the same injury and settlement in the sum of £80,000 (plus costs) was reached in late 1990.</P>
      <P>Where a person is granted both a service pension under the Defence Forces (Pensions) schemes and a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts, the schemes provide that the service pension is reduced &mdash; in practice by an amount equivalent to one-half of the disability pension.  On his being granted a disability pension, the service pension of the person in question was reduced in accordance with the provisions mentioned.</P>
      <P>Section 13 (2) of the Army Pensions Act, 1923 (as amended), provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that where compensation is received after the grant of a disability pension, the pension may be reviewed and may be terminated or reduced.  In such cases the Defence Forces (Pensions) schemes provide that the reduction in the service pension shall continue to apply.</P>
      <P>Following the settlement of his civil action, the disability pension in this case was duly reviewed and the reduction of his service pension continued in accordance with the provisions of the pensions schemes.</P>

      <P>Subhead D1 of Vote 35 makes provision for cost of acquisition of land, buildings, etc. at State airports.  Increased expenditure in 1992 relates to final payments still outstanding on purchases initiated last year.</P>
      <P>Subhead F2 provides for subscriptions to international organisations.  Expenditure for 1991 reflected a saving of over £1 million in Ireland's subscription arising from Eurocontrol's decision to change the manner of financing certain elements of expenditure last year.  Subhead F2 for 1992 includes provisions for a major increase on the EUMETSAT subscription but a reduction in that to Eurocontrol is anticipated again this year and will be reflected in a budgetary adjustment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for an airport at Letterkenny, County Donegal, have been under consideration for a number of years.</P>
      <P>An application for £2.5 million EC assistance for the Letterkenny project was included in my Department's application for aid under the operational programme on peripherality in mid-1989.  I followed up this application in April 1990 with strong representations to the EC Commissioner for Regional Policy seeking confirmation that European Regional Development Fund money would be forthcoming as I would like to inform the promoters of the airport as soon as possible to enable them to start raising the necessary finance for their contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1990, I received a reply that no assurance of European Regional Development Fund assistance could be given.  In June 1990, the Commission rejected the Letterkenny proposal for assistance stating that they were not convinced that the proposed creation of an airport at Letterkenny should be assisted by the European Regional Development Fund, taking into account the presence of Eglinton Airport nearby and the improved road link between Letterkenny and the Border.  The Commission stated that there were also two other airports in or close to County Donegal &mdash; Carrickfin and Sligo &mdash; both of which were to be improved with European Regional Development Fund assistance under the <Col N="330" /> programme.  If Letterkenny were to be assisted, according to the Commission, there would then be four airports serving the north-west of Ireland, all created or improved with European Regional Development Fund aid.  They concluded by saying that such an outcome would be very hard to justify and that one or more of these airports would rapidly become unviable.</P>
    <P>On 24 October 1990, I met with the Letterkenny Airport Committee and informed them, despite severe financial constraints on the Exchequer, I would be prepared to seek Government approval for Exchequer assistance towards a scaled down air facility.  By way of example I cited the type in operation on the Aran Islands.</P>
    <P>In May 1991 I received a submission from Donegal County Council, which outlined two options for an airport costing £3.346 million and £4.596 million, respectively.  Both envisaged a 1,400 × 30 metre runway capable of handling Fokker 50 commuter-type aircraft.  Projections of passenger numbers, revenue and expenditure were subsequently provided by Donegal County Council. Additional information in support of the proposal was sought by my Department in November 1991.  This information has not yet been received.</P>
