      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give details of the names of those currently employed as research counsellors, research assistants or officers of the Law Reform Commission; whether such persons are regarded as civil servants, and if he will outline the statutory or contractual restraints, if any, on such persons openly engaging in political activity.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The following persons are currently employed by the Law Reform Commission in the positions referred to by the Deputy: William Binchy, B.A., B.C.L., LL.M., Barristerat-Law (research counsellor); Cliona Kimber, LL.B., LL.M. (research assistant); Suzanne Egan, B.C.L. LL.M., Barrister-at-Law (research assistant); Julianne O'Leary, B.A., Barrister-at-Law (research assistant); Oisin Quinn, B.C.L., LL.M. (research assistant); John Quirke (secretary).</P>
      <P>With the exception of the secretary, who is on secondment from the Department of Education, none of these persons is a civil servant. Each is employed on contract. There are no express statutory or contractual restraints, save in the case of the secretary, who is subject to the normal Civil Service restraints. However, the condition implied in contracts of employment that an employee shall not engage in activities detrimental to his employer's interests would, of course, apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is inappropriate for persons employed in such serious positions to engage in political campaigns? Is it his view that the implied terms in the contract of employment that he refers to mean that each of the persons so employed should not be engaging in political campaigns in relation to the Maastricht Treaty, Article 40.3.3º or any other matter? Will the Taoiseach agree that for those persons to engage in such political campaigns is not compatible with their acting as researchers and legal assistants to the Law Reform Commission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the contract of the person to whom I think the Deputy is referring expired at the end of 1986 and a clause restricting the freedom to make public comment was discussed and the gentleman concerned was not prepared to accept it and, consequently nothing further was done at that time. I do not have to remind Deputy Shatter which Government were in power at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that such a term should not merely be implied in the contract of employment of a person employed by the Law Reform Commission but should be an expressed term of the contract of employment? Would he further agree that there is a contradiction in indicating to the former president of the Law Reform Commission that he could not make public comment on matters of public controversy such as those that have engaged the House in recent weeks in relation to Article 40.3.3º, or the Eighth Amendment, when the staff over whom he has jurisdiction are free to engage in such campaigns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware from his professional experience that an implied term in every contract of employment is that an employee shall not engage in activities that are detrimental to his or her employer's interests. I again point out to the Deputy that such a cause as he is now inferring should be there was not insisted upon by his own party when in Government in 1986-87. It is a little late in the day now to complain about that. I remind the Deputy that Mr. Binchy has a new appointment as Professor of Law at Trinity College and will be resigning from the commission on 30 June to take up that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the campaign in which Mr. Binchy has engaged, which is a grossly misleading campaign, is detrimental to his employer's interests and undermines the credibility of the Law Reform Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter would serve the national interest and the common good better by engaging himself in the campaign in a positive manner rather than being negative, as he is. It is our duty as politicians to point out to the people what the choices are and let them make their decision.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline, (a) the number of those aged 55 or over who, in March 1992, were listed under the pre-retirement allowance and pre-retirement credits, (b) the total number registered as unemployed including those on PRETA and PRECS in March, 1992 and (c) the percentage of the workforce represented by that figure.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 7,597 persons on the Pre-Retirement Allowance scheme (PRETA) and 3,786 persons on the Pre-Retirement Credit scheme (PRECS) on Friday, 27 March 1992. The combined total of those on the PRETA and PRECS schemes and those on the live register on the same date was 290,593 persons. This figure represents 21.8 per cent of the workforce as estimated in the April 1991 Labour Force Survey. I would point out, however, that persons on PRETA and PRECS are properly excluded from the live register on the basis of a declaration they make that they have retired from the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just told us that in March 21.8 per cent of the workforce including those over 55 were registered as being unemployed. The April figure is seasonably adjusted by another 6,700 so we are now close to 23 per cent. Would the Minister of State not accept that in order to have proper comparisons those over 55 should be included in the registered figures each month, as they have always been included, until this Government started massaging the figures in the last couple of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <asker>Mr. J. Mitchell</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if he will outline the total net emigration for the latest five years for which there are figures; and the percentage of workforce represented by that figure.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1986-1991 intercensal period it is estimated that outward migration exceeded inward migration by about 136,500 persons. This figure is derived as a residual by subtracting the natural increase in the population &mdash; that is the number of births less the number of deaths &mdash; from the change in population as measured by the 1986 and 1991 Censuses of Population.</P>
      <P>Arithmetically it may be calculated that this figure is equivalent to 10.3 per cent of the workforce as measured in the April 1991 Labour Force Survey. Such a calculation is not, however, very meaningful since the net migration figure represents the difference between two unknown gross flows over a five-year period which include persons who are not normally attached to the labour force, for example children, retired persons and non-working spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what excuses the Minister makes, he has, in the answers to these two questions, disclosed that 32.1 per cent of the workforce have failed to get employment in the last four years and that is before we take the April figures into account. Will the Minister not agree that this is failure on a grand scale, and that the Government have no policy to deal with unemployment?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is rather disingenuously combining two sets of percentages in the two questions which cannot be related.

      <P>On emigration, I do not know how Deputy Mitchell could know how many people have emigrated for reasons other than jobs.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 15, 24, 60 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The gas interconnector project is now at an advanced stage. There are various aspects which are scheduled for execution at different times throughout the period up to the target completion date in October 1993.</P>
      <P>The pipeline route will run from North County Dublin to Moffat in southern Scotland. Major contracts have recently been awarded for subsea construction, supply of pipeline steel and pipe coating. These contracts are worth about £140 million. Further contracts will be awarded during the coming year.</P>
      <P>While I have made the interconnector project a priority and my Department have been closely involved in the planning, Deputies will appreciate that I have no function in regard to the award of these contracts by Bord Gáis Éireann. I understand from the board, however, that they have adhered to all the relevant tendering and evaluation procedures, including, where appropriate, advertising in the Official Journal of the European Community. This will ensure that the project is carried out in the most cost effective manner and in accordance with EC requirements on competition.</P>
      <P>The financial viability of the interconnector project is not in doubt; indeed it received Government and EC approval only after intensive and detailed examination of project economics and feasibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann will fund the cost of the project, net of EC grant aid at approximately 35 per cent of expenditure, from borrowings, own resources and I hope, through participation by other parties. It is my intention, however, that the pipeline will be operated by a <Col N="10" /> separate company in which Bord Gáis Éireann would have a controlling interest. The financial package will depend on the level of outside participation in this company. The interconnector pipeline will be operated as a commercial venture. That means that there will be access to supplies, wherever practicable, and particularly for major customers. It is not clear at this time that this requires any legislative intervention.</P>
    <P>Regarding ESB participation, Deputies will recall the answer given on my behalf by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, recently in which I made it clear that there is no question of the ESB being excluded from this project and that the recent rejection by the board of Bord Gáis Éireann of participation terms proposed by the ESB in no way precludes the ESB from submitting a more suitable proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate the gross cost of the construction of the interconnector? What arrangements have been made to sanction the required borrowings and what level could these borrowings reach for Bord Gáis Éireann? What impact could this have on the cost of gas in the long term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated cost of the project, in current terms is £290 million. As I indicated, Bord Gáis Éireann are the company charged with promoting and bringing this project to fruition. They are having discussions with potential investors in the possible joint venture project. Therefore, the financial arrangements in relation to that matter have not been finalised. Of course my Department, with the Department of Finance, will be closely involved in granting approval to the arrangements entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to ongoing discussions. Can he state whether there are other interested parties actively taking part in the discussions at present? In the absence of such participation can he say what Government clearance, and to what extent, has been given for Bord <Col N="11" /> Gáis Éireann to enter into financial commitments on their own behalf, as clearly they are doing at present? Furthermore, can he say what will be its impact, first, on Government dividends from Bord Gáis Éireann and, second, the cost of gas here in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House will appreciate that these are commercially sensitive matters and it would not be appropriate for me to disclose any great detail in relation to them at this time. If the final financial package is such that it has an impact on the dividend payments of Bord Gáis Éireann to the Exchequer, that is a matter that will be carefully examined by my Department and by the Department of Finance. These form very much part of the overall ongoing discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6, 32, 36, 37, 41, 51, 81, 87, 88 and 95 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> The Deputies will be aware that the Government recently approved my proposal for a major review of the structure of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board have served the country well since 1927 in developing a reliable electricity supply system. During the development stages of the system, considerations of economy of scale and the relatively undeveloped stage of the economy dictated that the ESB should operate as a monopoly. The company are now, however, operating in a markedly different economic environment and the justification for such a monopoly is less apparent. For this reason I considered that the existing arrangements needed to be reviewed. While it is widely accepted that electricity transmission and distribution systems are natural monopolies, there would appear to be scope for competition in the generation side of the business. I believe that consumers are likely to benefit from the increased cost transparency which would be available if the network business is separated from generation and from the introduction of competition into the generation business.</P>
    <P>I am currently in the process of appointing consultants to assist my Department in the review. There will be full consultation with the ESB. In this context I have invited both the board of ESB and the ESB group of unions to make submissions as part of the review process. I would like to make it clear that, in devising a new framework for the electricity industry, I do not envisage a change from public to private ownership of the existing ESB assets. Until the study has been completed I am not able to be more specific about the exact arrangements. I hope to be able to report to Government on this important matter before the end of July.</P>
    <P>In parallel with my own belief that it is time to reconsider our electricity business, the EC Commission is pressing member states for increased competition and more openness in the electricity sectors with the advent of the European Single Market in 1993. Discussions with member states on a draft directive dealing <Col N="14" /> with the Commission's proposals in this area have started recently. I consider that the review will be an important element in formulating Ireland's position on these proposals. As no final decision has been taken on the EC proposals, the question of Ireland's compliance does not arise.</P>
    <P>Any necessary legislative changes will not be considered until the review has been completed and Government have had the opportunity of considering the matter in detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether he has taken a decision in principle or if it will be dependent on the outcome of this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The only decision in principle the Minister and Government have taken is that the operations of the ESB are to be reviewed in a comprehensive way with the objective of ascertaining whether competition can be introduced into the electricity generating business here and how best that might be done. Outside of that decision in principle no other decision has yet been taken.</P>
      <P>The Government and I expressed a preference, in order to achieve the intention of competition, for splitting the ESB into two separate companies, one a generating company, the other a transmission-distribution company with the intention of introducing the competition element through the generation side of the electricity business of opening it up to private investment in new power generation companies who would then be in competition with the existing ESB generating company who would sell into the transmission company. That is merely a suggested manner in which competition could be achieved; it is by no means a requirement of the proposals. No decisions have been taken in relation to how best we might achieve competition in this business for the benefit of consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the depth of concern these proposals have caused the unions? When replying he indicated he was seeking submissions. Would he give a commitment in the <Col N="15" /> House to personally meet the unions and maintain close, open discussion with them throughout the process of this study?</P>
      <P>I have two other specific questions. First, in the context of this study would the Minister undertake to examine the relative size of the Irish network saying whether it would be appropriate, without incurring diseconomies, to create two new management systems, being aware of his recent experience of merely pursuing competition for its own sake, when he had to row back from that position? Furthermore, would the Minister give the House a commitment that he would closely examine the experience of restructuring and privatisation of electricity in Britain, the consequences of which proved to be very different from what had been expected by those who undertook it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's leader recently spoke strongly in favour of the necessity to introduce competition into every aspect of economic life here. I would be surprised if the Deputy was in any way critical of the attempts of this Government and I to seek to achieve that worthwhile objective in the interests of our consumers. The concerns to which the Deputy referred, I might suggest, arose largely as a result of inaccurate press reporting in relation to the Government's decision when it was incorrectly stated &mdash; in broad headlines &mdash; that the Government and I were on a path to privatise the Electricity Supply Board. As I have clearly outlined, that is not the position as was clearly stated when that decision was first referred to in the initial press release, in numerous press statements and in replies to questions in this House on this matter previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister specifically undertake to meet the unions in person and maintain close contact with them throughout the duration of the study? Would he respond to my question about the experience of privatisation and restructuring of public utilities in Britain?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, at this stage the focus is on identifying and evaluating restructuring options. As I have said, I have already invited the unions to make a submission to me in relation to how best they consider that the Electricity Supply Board might be structured in future years. There is wide acceptance throughout the electricity industry here that competition has to be introduced. Indeed, many ESB management personnel and employees at different levels to whom I have spoken are fully cognisant of this fact and, they have told me personally, welcome the idea of introducing competition into their industry.</P>

I have not yet received a submission from the unions but it is my intention to keep in touch with the ESB management during the course of this review and to carefully examine union submissions. I would not close the door on the idea of meeting them before I make any formal proposals in relation to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 26, 39, 56, 84, 85 and 86 together as they are linked by consideration of Bord na Móna's financial situation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the comprehensive review of Bord na Móna undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee. Many of the recommendations contained in the report are in line with my thinking and have generally confirmed the conclusions of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted that the committee supports, in principle, the provision of an Exchequer subsidy to Bord na Móna. I understand the committee's concern with the company's difficult financial position and I am also acutely aware of the dependence of the midlands region on the operations of Bord na Móna. It is precisely for those reasons that I am anxious to ensure that Bord na Móna will be properly positioned to operate as a dynamic, efficient and successful company and thus <Col N="19" /> capable of providing viable and sustainable employment for many years ahead. In the year ended March 1992, average employment by the company amounted to 2,344 with a peak employment figure of 2,767.</P>
    <P>The report lays great emphasis on the need for the board to implement, as a priority, a programme of debt reduction measures and draws attention to a number of areas where improvements in the company's position can be made. These areas, among others, have already been the subject of discussions between my Department and the company for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the board and management have undertaken, with the co-operation of the workforce, a major reorganisation and restructuring designed specifically to address these financial problems. While this process has proved successful in returning the company to profitability, there clearly remains much to be done if the level of indebtedness is to be reduced to manageable levels. In the last published accounts for the year ended March 1991, the board had borrowings of £189.7 million and a balance sheet deficit of £72.4 million. The accounts for the year ended March 1992 have not been finalised as yet but the indications are that they will show a reduction in the level of borrowings.</P>
    <P>It remains the Government's firm policy that Board na Móna should continue to make a significant contribution towards the national energy requirement and in so doing provide viable and sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation is that the only means by which the company will be enabled to maintain secure and viable employment and thus contribute to regional and national prosperity, is by becoming more competitive and reducing the level of debt. I am confident that they will do so. I am satisfied that a substantial reduction in the company's debt can be achieved without recourse to Exchequer assistance.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee's proposal that the company be formally structured <Col N="20" /> into subsidiary companies, with the greater part of the company's debt assigned to a holding company, would not of itself improve the overall position. The imperative need for the company now is to concentrate on the fundamental issues &mdash; the implementation of the necessary improvements in operational efficiencies in all areas of their activities.</P>
    <P>It is an intrinsic part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that commercial State companies should have the freedom to operate commercially. The programme stresses that the day to day operations should be a matter for the individual companies. The decision to close Lullymore briquette factory was one for the board of Bord na Móna to make and I do not believe, therefore, that it is at variance with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I outlined the background to this decision in this House recently. The board took the view that, in the light of a severe briquette production overcapacity and a declining solid fuel market, there was no realistic alternative to the permanent closure of one of the company's four briquette factories. While I share the regret of Oireachtas and local authority representatives from County Kildare and elsewhere and the community in general at the necessity for the board's decision, I must say that I believe the decision represents a realistic response by the board to severe over-capacity in a declining market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's reply. The dependence of the midlands on this company rings very hollow in the context of the substance of his reply. Will the Minister admit to the House that the Government have a policy of drift in relation to Bord na Móna and that the consequences of such policy will be further closures in the region? No alternative employment opportunities will be put in place unless Bord na Móna are given financial assistance to cope with their debt problem. Despite the progress which has been made by the company, and the attempts by the workers at the Lullymore plant to make that factory <Col N="21" /> competitive &mdash; they succeeded in doing this &mdash; this company will remain in a straitjacket due to their debt burden. The Government intend to leave the company in that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A very firm direction is being applied to the company in order to ensure their viability and safeguard employment in a group which is exploiting one of our few indigenous fuels. It is my policy, and the Government's intention, to continue the use of peat and turf in our energy mix for the next 40 years.</P>
      <P>I want to ensure that this company are put on a solid financial basis. The Deputy has to recognise the commercial reality of over-production of one of the company's products, namely briquettes. The company had to make a corporate decision in relation to this matter because they had too many production plants with the capacity to produce far in excess of what was being absorbed by the marketplace. Regrettably there is also an overall declining trend in the use of solid fuels generally. It is in that context and the threat to the company and the workers if something positive had not been done, and not just in the briquette section, that this decision unfortunately had to be made. It will contribute to strengthening the financial position of the company and reduce their debt by £10 million over the period of the corporate plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 17, 18, 23 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The EC is committed to stabilising CO 2 emissions in the Community as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2,000. This commitment was made at the joint Energy and Environment Council in Luxembourg in 1990 and reaffirmed in December 1991. In so far as member states such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece are concerned, this joint commitment provides for differential treatment, in accordance with the concept of equitable burden sharing, having regard to the economic and social development of those countries.</P>
      <P>The obvious measures to achieve this commitment include <i>inter alia</i>, (i) increased afforestation, (ii) switching to lower carbon fuels, e.g. gas and renewables (iii) increased energy conservation together with improved efficiency and (iv) the application of new technology for appliances, equipment and industrial processing.</P>
      <P>One of the specific measures suggested by the Commission in response to the joint Council's decisions is to encourage energy efficiency and conservation through the introduction of a carbon tax. The joint Council have acknowledged that such an instrument is likely to be needed and have asked the Commission to carry out further studies. The matter will be considered further when the studies are completed, probably later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of an energy/carbon tax are being considered by the Departments of Energy, Finance and the Environment. An ESRI study on the macro-economic impact of such a tax is nearing <Col N="24" /> completion. While this work is already under way it is important to understand that the Commission is still examining the structure and application of such a tax. These considerations, together with the Commission studies, will be material to developing a policy response for Ireland's contribution to achieving the objective of Community stabilisation.</P>
    <P>Given that the question of a tax awaits the outcome of those studies the question of a derogation for Ireland does not arise at this time. The question of allocation of possible revenues from such a tax is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In line with the decision of the joint Council of December last, a national programme including a comprehensive approach on strategies and targets for limiting CO 2 emissions is being prepared at present by the Department of the Environment in consultation with other Departments, including Energy. When completed the programme will be transmitted to the Commission.</P>
    <P>In this context I am in agreement with the general view that energy conservation is the best method in the short term of reducing CO 2 emissions. Ireland has an ongoing energy conservation programme and possibilities for expanding that programme are kept under review. Measures being worked out at present under the Community SAVE programme to support energy conservation initiatives by member states will form part of our future conservation activities.</P>
    <P>In our view also the development of forestry in Ireland will play a role in limiting our CO 2 emissions. Forests absorb and retain large amounts of CO 2. Our rapidly increasing forest area could absorb as much as one-third of our expected growth in emissions. Inclusion of sink capacity in calculating emissions of CO 2 is a vital element of our national programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information to a range of questions from the Fine Gael Party. Would he outline what differential treatment has been agreed for Ireland, Spain and Portugal in <Col N="25" /> the context of the requirement to curb CO 2 emissions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the agreement provides for differential treatment; I did not say that any specific preferential treatment had been decided upon as yet. It will be possible for us to seek preferential treatment in relation to any final agreements made on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister still of the view that CO 2 taxes are unlikely to be a reality for us? Does he accept the view held generally in Europe that the first of these taxes will be introduced in the 1993 budget, increasing thereafter until the year 2000? If so, would he agree that a tiny proportion of these taxes, if utilised in the areas specified in Deputy Doyle's question &mdash; anti-pollution and particular energy conservation &mdash; could make a huge contribution to those programmes in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the adoption of the carbon tax proposal would have very wide implications for the economies and for the industrial and commercial prosperity of member countries. Progress on this issue at European level is being made only following very thorough studies of the implications of such a tax. The environment conference scheduled for Rio this summer was expected at one stage to move in this direction but, short of offering a personal opinion, that looks less likely now than it did some time ago. Decisions in this regard are under consideration and I cannot forecast what the final outcome will be. Taking into account the views expressed by other member countries at environment and energy joint Council meetings, there are major obstacles to be overcome and I would not care to make a forecast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that an unofficial ERSI report of last autumn conducted by Messrs. Fitzgerald and McCoy, states that an energy or carbon tax would be of great economic <Col N="26" /> benefit to this country, especially if it were introduced unilaterally and if the proceeds were used to reduce taxes on labour? Would the Minister comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The only ESRI report I am familiar with has been published relates to preliminary results for the domestic sector which indicated that the tax proposal would increase energy prices by 15 per cent, with an associated reduction in consumption of 4 per cent. The study found that the tax would bear most heavily on lower income groups, that is, those most dependent on solid fuel. Full results of studies on all sectors will be completed in late 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>If we receive the preferential treatment concerning emissions to which he referred, does that mean we can continue polluting more freely than other countries might do? If carbon tax was introduced would the Minister support the idea for the capitalisation of public transport, thereby encouraging motorists to reduce pollution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of preferential treatment Ireland would be interested in achieving would include provisions to enable us to continue to use peat in energy industry. Matters of that kind in which we have a national interest would be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister is rather coy about making an analysis of what is likely to happen at European level, could he tell us what case he and the Government are making at that level in relation to these issues? Does he support the implementation of a carbon tax, and, if so, is he indicating ways in which it would be used? What is the input of the Minister and the Minister for the Environment in these discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussions Ireland has indicated its agreement in principle to such a proposal and we have indicated areas which must be carefully examined and taken into account before any final <Col N="27" /> decisions are made. We are adopting a positive attitude in the discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11, 30, 82, 89 and 90 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Government's policy every effort has been made to attract <Col N="28" /> a suitable investor for the upgrade of Whitegate Oil Refinery. Discussions with prospective partners have been held for over two years with potential joint venture partners. Currently, officials of my Department, together with the Irish National Petroleum Corporation are discussing a specific proposal for the refinery. I am precluded for reasons of commercial confidentiality from giving details of these ongoing discussions. The approach would involve a joint venture and an upgrade.</P>
    <P>The level of investment required to update the refinery would depend on the nature of the upgrade project chosen. I am unable, therefore, at present to estimate levels of investment or the Government contribution required. My objective is that product prices resulting from an upgrade would be competitive with free market import prices, and that the upgrade would give products meeting the future environmental standards.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made, in tandem with the upgrade of Whitegate and otherwise, to attract suitable investment which would enable reactivation of the Whiddy Oil Terminal.</P>
    <P>No decisions have been taken to date on the future for either facility. I have stated before that full evaluation of any proposals for an upgrade or reactivation is essential to ensure the optimum overall benefit to the Irish consumer. Deputies will understand that a refinery upgrade involves complex and finely balanced decisions on technical and economic issues which encompass the three major elements of chosen feedstocks, the required product profile and the cost of the upgrade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is a considerable degree of frustration at this stage on the part of people like myself who have a constituency interest in one of the facilities and those in the Cork area because the problem in the Whitegate Oil Refinery has not been resolved? Would he not accept that his assertion that he is precluded from discussing the details because negotiations are underway is <Col N="29" /> somewhat similar to the story we have been hearing for quite some time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is true, unfortunately, and I have indicated that it is not my intention as Minister to recommend to Government an arrangement which would not be in the best interests of this nation. I will not make any recommendation until a satisfactory proposal is negotiated which I feel would merit Government support and which would have the support of Members of this House. If I were to make a decision in this matter which was not in the best interests of the economy or the Exchequer, I could well understand there would be many people who would be very quick to seize on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if those with whom discussions are underway at present are the same people as those to whom he referred more than a year ago in March 1991? Is the figure of the estimated cost of upgrading the Whitegate Oil Refinery still within the range of the £80 million to £350 million he talked about at that time? Do the current negotiations include reference to the Whiddy Oil Terminal? Finally, may I ask if the Minister is in the process of negotiation with national or international parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions are commercially sensitive and it would not be helpful if I were to disclose too much detail in the House. The cost of upgrading can very greatly as the Deputy indicated &mdash; depending on the particular <Col N="30" /> configuration one agrees to: one can agree to undertake a minor upgrading of the refinery at a lower cost or one can decide on a more complex upgrading which would give a wider range of products and allow for the processing of increased volumes. This is a matter that would have to be decided by the parties making the investment together with the Department. None of the discussions have reached that stage.</P>
      <P>The only information I can give the House is that senior officials of my Department are constantly in touch with potential investors. Since I became Minister, a large number has indicated an interest. All facilities in my Department which are necessary to provide full information about Whitegate Oil Refinery have been made available by INPC and by officials of my Department, where appropriate. We have not concluded any final agreement with any of the interested parties who have come to talk to us about investing in the Whitegate Oil Refinery. We are continuing our discussions with companies who have expressed a serious interest and whom we believe to have a serious interest in the refinery. We will continue to do so until such time as we can reach a satisfactory financial arrangement. I will not make a recommendation to Government to accept a financial proposal which would not be in the best interests of the economy. We have a valuable national asset at Whitegate and on Whiddy Island and I will not preside over negotiations where they are given away for nothing to some speculative investor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I share his view that these are valuable national assets but fraught with certain problems. Has the Minister built into the figures of any projected deal the cost of ending the compulsory uptake from the Whitegate Oil Refinery, or does he see that as an ongoing and separate decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>An important part of the Programme for Government, agreed between the two parties in Government <Col N="31" /> was that every effort should be made to seek an investor for Whitegate with the intention of eliminating the mandatory regime which, as the Deputy may know, is a diseconomy to consumers here. That is one of the basic reasons I am so anxious to reach a satisfactory outcome. The Deputy can be assured of my intentions in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that only four of the 12 storage tanks on Whiddy Island are in use for the purposes for which they were built; and the eight empty storage tanks could, I understand, be used for fish farming, particularly for turbot or possibly lobster? This is an environmentally friendly activity which would be welcomed by local people as opposed to its reopening as an oil storage terminal, which is not. Will the Minister give serious consideration to carrying out a survey on this possibility?</P>

      <P>If so, the Deputy should be aware that some experiments on fish farming were done but the venture was not a success.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We should seek to utilise this major oil storage facility for the purpose for which it was built. With that in mind I have initiated a major refurbishment of the facilities on Whiddy Island. When I became Minister this oil storage facility was lying idle. It is easy for the Deputy to say that eight tanks are empty but all the tanks were empty until I began to utilise some to store our vital <Col N="32" /> national oil stocks. At present 205,000 tonnes of crude oil is held on Whiddy in compliance with our EC and other international obligations to maintain 90 days stocks of oil in the country. Whiddy Island is playing a vital part in ensuring that our national stocks are in compliance with out national agreement.</P>
      <P>As Deputies, locally at any rate, will be aware, the terminal is being maintained on a care and maintenance basis by the INPC subsidiary, Bantry Terminal Limited. In addition, extensive refurbishment work costing £1.88 million has been carried out over the past year and is still in progress. The European Community has agreed to fund approximately half of the cost of this work. I am sure the House will agree that this refurbishment work will make the facility more attractive to a potential investor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 66 and 91 together</P>
      <P>The oil terminal at Whiddy has a total storage capacity of over one million tonnes. It is operated by Bantry Terminals Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation. During the Gulf crisis in 1990, 205,000 tonnes of crude oil were placed in storage in the terminal to cater for any shortages which might occur. Those stocks still remain in tanks at Whiddy. This crude, together with companies and Whitegate stocks, ensure that we meet our international obligations to hold 90 day's stocks of oil.</P>
      <P>Works aimed at refurbishing five tanks at the terminal are ongoing at present. The cost of this work will approach nearly £2 million, and it has qualified for grant approval of up to 50 per cent expenditure from the European Commission, under the PERIFRA programme which is designed to assist peripheral regions in actions of an exceptional nature arising from the Gulf crisis during 1990. I am informed by INPC that 45 people are employed at Whiddy at present, of whom 25 are employed on the refurbishment.</P>
      <P>I am making every effort to attract suitable investment which would enable reactivation of Whiddy on a permanent basis. I should add that the serious discussions about which I was asked referred to Whitegate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information. He will appreciate my concern is to see Whiddy operate at 100 per cent capacity. Can the Minister inform me if the future of Whiddy is involved in the Whitegate negotiations <Col N="34" /> which are at present under way? Are there separate negotiations in relation to Whiddy? Does he see an independent existence for Whiddy, divorced from the future of Whitegate? Can he give me any realistic hope that Whiddy will be operating on a 100 per cent basis in the short to medium term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My preferred option would be to find an investor who would upgrade Whitegate and utilise the Whiddy storage facility in the one project. On the other hand, if an investor is interested in only one of the facilities, then that will be carefully examined. The discussions referred to earlier, in which we had been involved for some months past, related to a proposal to upgrade the Whitegate Oil Refinery and were not directly related to Whiddy. My officials, Bantry Terminals personnel and INPC personnel are involved at all times in discussions with prospective investors and have always sought to interest them in Whiddy. There have been some discussions in the past year where proposals were brought forward which would have merely entailed utilising. Whiddy as a storage facility. The situation that obtains at present is that we are continuing to seek a serious investor in Whiddy Island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to see the future for Whiddy associated with Whitegate but if, as it appears, the discussions at present deal solely with Whitegate that would leave Whiddy out in the cold. Would the Minister see merit in undertaking a separate marketing operation in relation to Whiddy to see whether we can find a future for Whiddy independent of Whitegate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I did not give that impression because we are seeking a separate investor, if such exists, who would be merely interested in Whiddy. We are seeking to market both together if possible and we are continuing to try to market both singularly in the event that we cannot find an investor interested in taking on both.</P>

      <P>I wish to seek clarification from the Taoiseach with regard to the time proposed to be allowed for <Col N="147" /> the debate on the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution. I understand from the schedule of business for the week that it is proposed to allow only one and a quarter hours for the Committee Stage debate on both the Referendum Bill and the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill. Both Bills are extremely important and require more than one and a quarter hours to be dealt with on Committee Stage for a variety of reasons which I do not propose to go into at this point. Will the Taoiseach clarify that that is the intention or is he prepared, through the Whips, to reconsider that and extend the time available for Committee Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my complete agreement with what Deputy De Rossa said about the grossly inadequate time available on Committee <Col N="148" /> Stage. As one of those people that he would seek to assist by allowing as long as possible a Second Stage, I would say that it would suit me and, I think, many back bench Deputies much better if we had a bit less time on Second Stage and more time on Committee Stage. Finally let me ask the Taoiseach why the Democratic Left have been singled out for time on this matter. They are not a recognised group within the House. The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, and The Workers' Party are being given no priority time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy would agree that they are slightly more in number than the Green Party. The desired option in relation to the agreement reached by the Whips was that this is a Bill that did not command that much time for Committee Stage and consequently maximum time was given to Second Stage.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that as far as the initial speeches are concerned a party of six Members, the Democratic Left, is receiving the same amount of time as the Government and a party of 55, the main Opposition Party, will you ensure that in allocating the limited time available for other speakers in this debate you will endeavour to achieve reasonable proportionality relative to the size of parties so that back benchers on both the Government and Opposition sides of the House will have an opportunity of contributing and will not find that they are deprived of that opportunity because of your wish to facilitate parties of one member?</P>

      <P>The Government have indicated that they have certain proposals for the reform of the Dáil. Would the <Col N="149" /> Taoiseach agree that it would be useful to have a debate here in plenary session of the Dáil, and that the discussion should not be confined solely to those who happen to be members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges before decisions are taken, so that every Member of this House and, indeed, the public would have an opportunity to contribute on this very important matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

The question is if the Taoiseach would agree that it would be useful to have a discussion here in this House before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges come to decisions about the matter?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me bring to your attention and the attention of the Taoiseach my dissatisfaction with the procedure in relation to questions. As you are aware, Sir, it has been a longstanding precedent in the House that the Taoiseach would take questions in relation to statements made by him outside this House. I duly tabled a question to the Taoiseach asking him to elaborate on remarks he made at the IMI Conference in Killarney recently and it has been diverted to the Department of the Marine who, I assume, have no responsibility for the Taoiseach's plans for the Shannon region; they seem to have been thought up on the plane on the way to Killarney that morning. Is the Taoiseach changing precedent in this House or will he reply <Col N="150" /> to questions in relation to the statements he has made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The general office will always say, whenever a Taoiseach's question is referred to another Department, that they have no say in the matter and that it is the Taoiseach's Department who refer the question to another Department.

      <P>Tairgím: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bille don Dara Uair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The text of this Bill to amend our Constitution is simple, straightforward and limited solely to enabling the State to ratify the Treaty on European Union signed at Maastricht on 7 February last and become a member of this Union, as well as enabling the State to ratify the Agreement relating to Community Patents of 15 December 1989, between the member states of the Communities.</P>
      <P>The form of the amendment is the same as in 1987, except that there is a reference to European Union as well as to the Communities, and to bodies competent under the Community Treaties, such as the European Monetary Institute to be established at Stage 2 of European Monetary Union. They do not include the Western European Union. The Union consists of three pillars, the Communities, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and co-operation in the sphere of Justice and Home Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Community Patents Agreement was signed by Ireland in 1989. Because the Agreement was concluded inter-governmentally and is thus not necessitated by the obligations of EC membership, provisions which conflict with the supremacy of Irish courts would not be covered under our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Agreement will provide an easier and less expensive system of registering patents, valid throughout the Community. It is one of the important measures still outstanding for completion of the Internal Market. Apart from issues of principle involved in ten of our EC partners going ahead without us, it would be ludicrous to place our businesses and inventors under a competitive disadvantage. <Col N="156" /> There have been consistent calls over the past three to four years for this Patents Agreement to be ratified. This is non-controversial, and should have cross-party support.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment will deal, in his contribution, with the Referendum (Amendment) Bill, 1992, concerning other procedural issues, such as the text of the statement relating to the proposed amendment which will appear on polling cards and in notices to be displayed in polling stations.</P>
    <P>The European Union Treaty represents a decisive step in the historical evolution of the Community and in the future shape of Europe as a whole. We are fortunate to be members, and to be in a position to play a full part in all future developments. The Community and now the Union represents one of the most significant achievements of the 20th century, and is poised to play a key role in the 21st century as the most modern, developed form of human organisation.</P>
    <P>Ratification will be completed by all our partners before the end of this year, in some cases well ahead of target. We are determined to complete our ratification procedures in good time on this occasion. No insurmountable problems are foreseen in other member states. Denmark will be the only other member state holding a referendum, on 2 June. The Danish Government's campaign has the strong support of industry and business leaders as well as the trade unions. The opinion poll trend is increasingly positive.</P>
    <P>The same arguments are being heard throughout the Community, President Mitterand in an interview on 11 April has told the French people: &ldquo;I am committed to Europe, whatever the risks. The problem is to know if France will commit herself to take part in a great enterprise, from which she will emerge stronger, or if on the contrary, she will be isolated and miss her destiny... I want France to live in a zone of peace, and remain there for a long time, if not forever&rdquo;. These are very much our sentiments too.</P>
    <P>Despite concerns on certain issues, the European Parliament, last month urged, <Col N="157" /> by a huge majority, EC national parliaments to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. The Treaty has the support of the ETUC, which represents millions of trade unionists, as well as of employer bodies at EC level, such as UNICE and the CEEP. In that context, I welcome the decision here of SIPTU and the ATGWU, of the CII, the Irish Farmers' Association and Macra na Feirme to urge a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>The largely positive experience of EC membership over the past 20 years should not be obscured by present high unemployment, due mainly to demographic factors. We have experienced, taking the period as a whole, one of the highest EC growth rates. Our <i>per capita</i> income, which has grown by nearly a half in real terms, is now 69 per cent of the EC average instead of 59 per cent in 1973, clear evidence of covergence. We also have 70,000 more people in employment.</P>
    <P>Ireland will surely join all our partners and the broad spectrum of opinion across the Community, in supporting the European Union Treaty, to which we will contribute and from which we will benefit. Let me remind people of what is principally involved: the provisions on Economic and Monetary Union and a single currency, which are entirely new; continued, unrestricted access for our industrial and agricultural exports to a Single Market of 360 million people, including EFTA countries, and increased opportunities for mobility throughout Europe for our young people; provisions which strengthen cohesion, with firm commitments on issues such as eligibility, rates of aid from the Structural Funds, the easing of additionality requirements, plus a reduced burden of contributions to the Community budget for less prosperous member states in the Protocol on Cohesion; the establishment of a new Cohesion Fund for the four less prosperous member states; the strengthening of existing areas for Community action such as R &amp; D, environment and social policy; new provisions on education, culture, health, trans-European networks, industry, consumer <Col N="158" /> protection, European citizenship; strengthened co-operation in the fight against drugs, fraud, international crime; strengthened co-operation on foreign and security policy, giving us greater influence than we could have on our own, and which will enhance the capacity of the Union to contribute to peace and stability in Europe and in the wider world; improved decision-making procedures, and a larger role for the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provides a comprehensive and factual outline of what is in the Treaty. There is a thorough and objective analysis and assessment of the implications and benefits for this country. We will also be distributing to every household a brief, simple guide to the Treaty and the issues involved.</P>
    <P>EMU is the natural extension of the Single Market. Increased co-ordination of economic policies and the development of a single monetary policy and a single currency under European Monetary Union are required, if the full benefits of the Single Market are to be realised.</P>
    <P>Irish firms are already successfully meeting the challenge of the Single Market. This is of much greater importance for us than most member states. Our EC partners take over 75 per cent of our exports, which represent 42 per cent of our national output, three times the Community average, and we have a £2½ billion surplus with them. Our exports last year were valued at £15 billion, a 5 per cent increase on the 1990 figures, with the rate of growth of indigenous exports once again out-performing total export growth. This was a remarkable performance, given very difficult economic conditions. All the indications are of increased export buoyancy so far this year, with a £500 million trade surplus in the first two months. These figures demonstrate the benefits of our participation in the Community, quite apart from the direct impact of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research <Col N="159" /> Institute in a recent report concluded that European Monetary Union, taken together with 1992 and the Structural Funds, could raise GNP by an extra 7 to 8 per cent by the year 2000 and increase net employment by 55,000. As a direct result of European Monetary Union, substantially more young people will be able to find jobs in Ireland. While I would not wish to claim that there is no possible downside to European Monetary Union for Ireland, it is up to us to confront the challenges and the difficulties.</P>
    <P>The economic and budgetary policies which the Government have been pursuing successfully here at home since 1987, combining financial discipline with structural transformation, and complemented by the progress towards the Single Market and the significant increases in the Structural Funds, have contributed to a major improvement in our economic performance.</P>
    <P>Our economic growth rates at close to 5 per cent over five years have been above the Community average, leading again to an increase in total employment after a period of sharp decline.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate has remained in low single figures due to our exchange rate policy within the EMS and to moderate wage developments arising from the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>Our public finances have been brought under control, with the national debt-GNP ratio steadily declining, down 23 points.</P>
    <P>Our interest rate differential <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Deutsche-Mark has been reduced from 9 per cent to less than 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our balance of payments surplus is growing.</P>
    <P>A more recent Commission study, &ldquo;One Market, One Money&rdquo; suggested that European Monetary Union, with the Single Market, could add at least 15 per cent, equal to four years' growth, to output and income in the EC as a bloc. This will happen in a number of ways. First, economic union implies closer co-ordination of economic policy &mdash; with a <Col N="160" /> more beneficial impact on growth and employment than the sum of the individual policies of the State acting alone. This is something which successive Irish Governments have long sought.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the primary aim of the single monetary policy, under an independent European Central Bank, will be price stability &mdash; the only sound basis for sustainable economic growth and lower interest rates. Under European Monetary Union, the level of interest rates and mortgage rates will reflect economic conditions in all member states, including Ireland, rather than in just one, as at present.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, establishment of a single currency will greatly reduce and ultimately eliminate exchange risks and transaction costs &mdash; thus giving an impetus to trade, investment, efficiency and confidence throughout the Community. This should be of considerable advantage to a country like Ireland, that has a currency that is not widely known or traded outside of Ireland, and it will be of great benefit to Irish people travelling abroad and to the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, European Monetary Union will make the Community one of the largest economic and monetary entities in the world &mdash; better able to compete on equal terms with the United States and Japan.</P>
    <P>We are also closely linked with the outside world from the point of view of investment, and we should benefit from a liberal Community regime for capital movements.</P>
    <P>Increased co-ordination of economic policies will be implemented by means of mutual surveillance and rules on budget deficits and their financing. The crucial rule on excessive budget deficits has been misinterpreted by even informed commentators. Ireland, as of now, meets the criterion that the budget deficit should not exceed a ratio of 3 per cent of GDP. The debt criterion would be breached, if the stock of debt exceeded 60 per cent of GDP and was not sufficiently diminishing towards this figure. Ireland's performance accords with that criterion, as acknowledged by the ECOFIN Council <Col N="161" /> last February. The targets set in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> indicate a firm resolve to maintain that position, not just to ensure our ability to participate in the final stage of European Monetary Union, but also to secure economic well-being. Member states will still be free to set their own budgetary priorities with regard to revenue and expenditure, but they will have to pay due regard to these agreed constraints.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in some quarters that the provisions of European Monetary Union would mean &ldquo;hairshirt budgets&rdquo;, higher taxes and cutbacks. On the contrary, we will continue to pursue the successful budgetary policies of the last few years, restraining borrowing, cutting taxes, and maintaining public services. But if we were to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;, it is then that we would have &ldquo;hairshirt&rdquo; budgets with a vengeance. Public expenditure would have to be cut severely, including inevitably social spending; many projects would have to be cancelled; and taxes would have to be raised. Interest rates and mortgage rates would rise substantially.</P>
    <P>A major contribution to our economic performance since 1989 has been made by the increased Structural Funds, which are necessary, if we are to have a chance to compete on equal terms. They have enabled us to accelerate nearly all our economic and social development programmes. As the White Paper states, Community assistance has allowed public expenditure to be brought to a level far higher than would otherwise have been possible. Between 1989 and 1993, there will have been £861 million in EC assistance for industry, £165 million for tourism, £562 million for roads and transport, £96 million for water and sewerage, £67 million for rural development, £56 million for forestry, £66 million for environmentally friendly farming, £347 million for other support measures for agriculture, £712 million for housing and education, and £200 million for a joint programme with Northern Ireland to promote cross-Border economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> I particularly want to stress the important contribution that programmes like INTERREG can make to life in the Border areas, and the important fillip the EC can give to larger projects such as the Dublin-Belfast railway and the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, which help to knit the two small economies on this island closer together and which are undoubtedly part of the framework for future peace and prosperity. Customs barriers, and the economic border between North and South, will disappear on 1 January next. The future of Ireland in Europe will be an important dimension of strand two of the political talks that are now under way.</P>
    <P>If we want to see our road network improved, our railways maintained, a modern public transport system provided for Dublin, more college places, proper and permanent income supports for our farmers, greater rural development, and more comprehensive programmes and training for the unemployed, and the Social Charter implemented then we will need additional funds. Social problems, like emigration from rural areas in the west, or high urban unemployment, will be difficult to tackle without increased resources. The gross European contribution to this year's budget alone is £2,200 million. In net terms, we get £6 per head for every £1 we contribute; the highest ratio for any member state. Where could much of this be replaced if we voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The Commission proposes to double the assistance to the four less prosperous member states from the Structural and Cohesion Funds taken together, so that we could reasonably look forward to receiving roughly £6,000 million between 1994 and 1998. Of course, tough negotiations lie ahead. We will rest our case for our full share on our very high level of unemployment and on our productive use of funds to date, which have resulted in an otherwise greatly improved economic performance. We will not get access to any of the funds attached to the Treaty, if we vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;. That is the certain position.</P>
    <P>Doubt has been cast on the political <Col N="163" /> reality of a further doubling of the Structural Funds in Europe generally. We were faced with a similar situation in 1987, when the doubling of the Structural Funds was first proposed. It was not actually agreed by the European Council until long after the Single European Act had been ratified. Even in 1989, I remember, all the sceptics doubted that we would get £3 billion. It is now clear that we will, in full.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of British and German opposition to this size of increase. Britain has been traditionally opposed, but in 1988 it did not at the end of the day use the veto. The German attitude, while often extremely reserved is, in the last analysis, dictated by a broad statesmanlike view of what European unity requires. Last December at Maastricht, Chancellor Kohl played a positive role in persuading Britain to accept, however reluctantly, the new Cohesion Fund, despite the financial burden of German unity.</P>
    <P>In this context, I would like to draw attention to a very positive interview in <i>Der Spiegel</i> by State Secretary Koehler of the German Finance Ministry about Ireland's recent economic progress. He was arguing that political solidarity in Western Europe was essential if it was to help the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and that the poorer member countries needed flanking support to reduce differences in development, a process from which all would profit. He strongly defended the Cohesion Fund, to protect the environment and to promote infrastructural investment, as creating better conditions for private investment. He then cited as a specific example a structurally weak country like Ireland, which had not misused its Structural Funds at others' expense but had brought its budget deficit down dramatically since 1986.</P>
    <P>The recent comments on the Irish &ldquo;Convergence Programme&rdquo; by the ECOFIN Council meeting of 10 February 1992 conveyed a similar message. The Council stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> Ireland's progress in recent years showed that it was possible to combine growth with stabilisation, and in particular to continue the catching-up process with successful pursuit of monetary stability.</P>
    <P>The Council stressed two contributions from the Community: the hard currency option within the EMS, which has promoted adjustment, while the strong growth performance has drawn substantial support from the Structural Funds. From an EC viewpoint, Ireland has proved a model for the productive use of the Structural Funds within a framework of strict economic discipline. I can think of no better platform for pressing for a continuation and stepping up of the current policy approach by the Community and by Ireland.</P>
    <P>A number of people have argued that, even if doubled again, the funds will still represent only a fraction of the transfers within a federal state. I strongly urge Deputies to keep their feet on the ground. The EC is not a fully fledged federal state, certainly at this stage. If we make unrealistic demands for huge automatic transfers, based on misleading analogies, we will do our case a disservice. We must proceed sensibly, and not imagine that our partners are going to make an unearned present to us of their standards of living without prolonged effort on our own part. Deputies who attend party meetings regularly with other European political leaders know the truth of what I am saying and that exaggerated demands are purely for domestic consumption. The Government's approach to Structural or Cohesion Funds is not one of a begging bowl attitude, but rather of our entitlements under the various funds of the different treaties. They were set up to help regions like Ireland to cope with increased competition in a more closely integrated Community. They are part of a deal that benefits all member states, including the wealthier ones.</P>
    <P>Any suggestion that Ireland will not be a full member in future of the Single Market and of the Union would cause a <Col N="165" /> major loss of investment confidence with devastating consequences for jobs. Who would invest to cater for a market of 3.5 million, when opportunities abound elsewhere in a market 100 times that size?</P>
    <P>The Treaty on European Union has overwhelming support among all Europe's main political parties and groupings. All the mature socialist parties in Europe, including the British Labour Party, are now firmly pro-European, and many leading political figures, who have been a driving force behind European Union, such as President Mitterand and President Delors, come from a socialist background. Even the Danish Social Democrats, who long held deep reservations about European integration, now back ratification of the European Union Treaty as &ldquo;imperative&rdquo;. Surely it is now reasonable to ask for a clear statement, not provided yesterday, of where the Labour Party here stand on a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote for Europe, especially as they have time and again, with much less justification, accused the Government of indecision. They have dithered and dallied for long enough. It is time to come off the fence and to show that they have a clear view supported by all their Deputies on this major issue.</P>
    <P>The EC has always been socially progressive, but especially so in recent years. The social dimension is seen as an essential adjunct to the Single Market. Ireland did not opt out of the Social Charter.</P>
    <P>At the Strasbourg European Council in December 1989, eleven of the twelve member states adopted the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers. The charter is a political statement of intent and covers areas such as the right of freedom of association, equal pay, working conditions and conditions of employment. Early in 1990 the Commission launched an action programme to implement it. Because of slow progress the Government joined at Maastricht with ten other member states in an agreement on social policy which increases the Community's capacity to act on social matters. The adoption of the Agreement by the Eleven was necessary in the face of the unwillingness of <Col N="166" /> the UK to go beyond existing Treaty provisions on social policy. The Agreement is linked to the Treaty by a protocol. It has treaty effect in so far as the eleven member states are concerned. The Eleven will have full access to all of the institutional machinery of the Community, including the Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The Agreement among the Eleven on social policy, along with Britain's opt-out clause in European Monetary Union, provides an interesting example of what a group of member states can do if they wish to go ahead with the development of European Union. It requires no great imagination to see this precise arrangement as a model to implement the Treaty on European Union if Ireland does not ratify. Another clear example was in 1979, when we joined the EMS and Britain stayed out.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion, though narrowly focussed, in recent months about the rights of women. The Community has been enormously positive for the rights of women. Community law has been the main inspiration for our domestic legislation on equal pay, equal opportunities and equal treatment, with regard to access to employment, training, promotion and working conditions, as well as in social security. Social cover has recently been extended to part-time workers, as well as protective labour legislation. Further progress will be made under the European Union and the Social Charter.</P>
    <P>More than rights and freedoms are involved. Many of these rights have important financial consequences. For example, we are now paying back money for equal treatment in the social welfare system, when a previous Government failed to fulfil their obligations to women under EC law between 1984 and 1986. The hypocrisy of some members of that Government, now posturing as champions of women's rights, does not impress the women of Ireland. Incidentally, the cost of this Government back money to Irish women is £22 million, which we provided in the 1992 budget, with further significant payments due in 1993 and 1994. I am confident that the women of <Col N="167" /> Ireland will ensure by a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote that they will not be downgraded to second-class European citizens.</P>
    <P>The Community has been equally positive with regard to the rights of workers, encouraging participation in decision-making, protecting health and safety at work and generally encouraging social partnership. Access to the European job market will be increasingly important, regardless of economic conditions, for our young people, providing them with opportunities for mobility and job experience and acquisition of working languages. Over 22,000 students in regional technical colleges and vocational education committee colleges receive direct grants and 1,000 research students will benefit this year from ERASMUS grants for study abroad. FÁS programmes, which will have trained more than 200,000 people from 1989-93, also receive indispensable EC funding.</P>
    <P>In view of all this, it is inconceivable how any self-respecting socialist could sit on the fence with regard to the European Union Treaty, let alone oppose it. There is no middle way, only a vote for or against. Support should not be conditional on the resolution of this or that individual issue. This debate is a good test of whether parties in this House are able to see the wood from the trees, the broad European issues from the strictly domestic ones.</P>
    <P>The only significant party in Europe to oppose the Treaty is the French Communist Party. It is ironic that, despite all their numerous name changes, the Deputies now calling themselves Democratic Left find themselves still aligned with their former allies in the European Parliament, the French Communist Party, in outright opposition to the European Union Treaty. Surely the time has come to abandon old style hard left opposition to the EC which is a throwback to the Cold War.</P>
    <P>There are interesting reports that many of the European Greens have a more positive attitude to the European Union Treaty. The Green Group of the European Parliament, as quoted in <i>Agence Europe</i><Col N="168" /> on 24 March 1992, called on the European Parliament as well as national Parliaments to ratify the Treaty, having sought from the European Council an agenda to repair alleged flaws in the Treaty. In particular, they want a further IGC at an early date and a draft European Constitution, an idea that does not much smack of outright opposition to European Union. The traditionally pro-European French Greens at their executive meeting ten days ago decided on a qualified &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and to distance themselves from the hardline left calls for a renegotiation. This is in great contrast to the unconditional opposition of the Greens in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Community has been a positive force for the protection of the environment. Community legislation has provided norms and standards which we now apply. The £1 billion investment required between now and the end of the century in Ireland to clear up pollution on farms, to improve the quality of rivers and lakes and seashores, to prevent air and marine pollution, depends on a significant contribution from the Structural and Cohesion Funds. The only way we can accelerate improvement of our environment is as full members of the European Union. Much concern is felt about the hazards of nuclear power. Who, if not the Community, is going to help the countries of Eastern Europe to make safe dangerous nuclear power stations; and to clean up the appalling pollution left by the State run economies? I would challenge the Green Party to explain how our environment or Europe's environment will be improved or enhanced by non-participation in European Union. Will opponents also explain to farmers how, without the Common Agricultural Policy they would fare on world markets where prices for meat, grain and dairy products are one half to one third of what they get in the Community?</P>
    <P>Neutrality is not an issue. No decisions are required under this Treaty about participation in a common defence policy, or what shape that might take. The Treaty does not require us to change our policy of non-participation in military alliances. <Col N="169" /> Unanimous agreement will be needed at any future intergovernmental conference which would then require to be ratified, by referendum of the Irish people, before there could be any change.</P>
    <P>The whole context of European security has changed. The system of opposing alliances no longer exists. The old military doctrines are becoming obsolete. The crucial point is that other European countries with a tradition of neutrality &mdash; Austria, Finland and Sweden &mdash; are seeking membership of the new European Union on the basis of the Treaty. It would be extraordinary if we, as members of the Community for 20 years, were suddenly to opt out, while those who did not join in 1972 because of their neutrality, have now decided to come in. As the Belgian Foreign Minister put it recently, the Union cannot require membership of a defence community, but neither in the context of a developing foreign and security policy can the eventual formation of a defence arm be ruled out. We have always accepted that possibility.</P>
    <P>The doctrinaire arguments being put forward here by opponents of the Union Treaty are unchanged since 1987 &mdash; as if the peaceful revolutions in Eastern Europe had not happened. Conditions are much more favourable than they were even five years ago for the implementation of the benign, non-aggressive type of policy based on agreement, co-operation and a broader concept of security. Our tradition and that of other like minded smaller European countries has much to contribute to the European Union of the future.</P>
    <P>Much is made of differing longer term agendas for the Community. Opponents of the Treaty also have their wider long term agendas. Many of them have on every possible occasion since 1972, opposed Irish membership of the Community and our participation in the further progress of the Community. Others not merely oppose the European Union Treaty, but have a wider political and economic strategy, involving repudiation of the national debt and abolition of the main sources of revenue, designed to make Ireland a revolutionary model for <Col N="170" /> countries of the Third World, of which we would then presumably be an integral part. Others from a strange mixture of Republican and Marxist philosophy stand on grounds of national sovereignty, forgetting that countries like Albania and North Korea are the most sovereign in the world, with few if any obligations to others, and corresponding poverty to go with it. Yet others continue, as in 1987, to perceive threats, however remote, to one aspect of fundamental rights and regard this as taking total precedence over all other aspects of the nation's welfare.</P>
    <P>However, even though I profoundly disagree with them, the opponents of the Treaty are doing a service to democracy in ensuring that all possible fears and concerns are fully debated, before a decision is made in the full light of all the foreseeable consequences. Those who campaign conscientiously against the Treaty are mostly patriotic people by their own lights. The debate will contribute to a new synthesis of wisdom and public knowledge about Europe. When we were in Opposition in 1986, we argued for a referendum on the Single European Act. It was healthy that one was held in 1987. There has been no argument about having a referendum now, and similarly in the future, if further fundamental changes in the Community or in the Union need to be approved. Regular consultation of the people is the foundation of the strong pro-European consensus that we have.</P>
    <P>The Treaty also expands and formalises the Community role in development co-operation, and the budget proposals for 1993-97 propose increased aid, which Irish development agencies such as Trocaire and Concern will help channel to developing countries.</P>
    <P>Article 128 of the Treaty, included at Ireland's behest, offers great potential to enrich our cultural life. It stresses that the EC will respect the national and regional diversity of the different cultures of Europe, while also emphasising our common cultural heritage. The EC can take action to assist cultural initiatives <Col N="171" /> of European significance in co-operation with member states.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to enter into detail on many important subjects, which my colleagues will deal with in much greater depth. The European Union Treaty represents an important achievement as well as a valuable opportunity. From what other source could we expect brighter prospects for the future? How else could we ever hope to achieve in due course average European living standards coupled with the highest quality of life? What other route offers greater hope for peace and stability both in Ireland and Europe, transcending the historic conflicts and oppositions of the past? I look forward to a strong campaign concentrated on the key issues, and I would like all parties to give a clear signal that Ireland is determined to remain in the centre of future European development. A good result would enhance the status of Ireland in Europe and at the negotiating table. I am confident the Treaty will receive the support of an overwhelming majority of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to add at the end of the motion &ldquo;this day two weeks provided that in the meantime the Government has initiated a Government Bill or the Dáil has approved at Second Stage a Private Members' Bill, to amend the Constitution providing that Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution shall not be invoked to prohibit or interfere with the exercise of the right to travel to or from the State for the purpose of receiving services lawfully available in other jurisdictions or to obtain, within the State, counselling and information relating to such services subject to such restriction as may be provided by law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confirm the positive response of Fine Gael to the Taoiseach's request for support for the Community Patents Agreement. In relation to the Taoiseach's remarks, may I say how glad I am that <Col N="172" /> he appears to have been converted to the European ideal, although it is fair to comment that he seemed to be rewriting history somewhat in relation to the Single European Act of 1986 when he spoke about Fianna Fáil in Opposition arguing for a referendum on that Act? My recollection was that the opposition of Fianna Fáil went a lot deeper at that time. However, we will let that pass; we are now talking about the future.</P>
    <P>As a people we should be proud to be Irish in Europe. We should vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the Treaty on European Union because, taking a calm and balanced view, it is in the best interests of our people to do so. We should also be self-confident about our place in Europe; the fact that we are enormous beneficiaries in financial terms does not mean we have nothing to offer Europe. We have our traditions, culture and impact to make on the development of European policies. We should neither overestimate nor underestimate the importance of this approach. Naturally the development of European Union will not be based on a prescription which suits solely Irish circumstances. On the other hand, European structures and institutions are such that a reasoned case made by Ireland on any issue always receives a fair hearing and, more often than not, evokes a positive response.</P>
    <P>The issue now facing us is whether we want to keep pace with and continue to be part of the development of the European Union or to isolate our country in a kind of European limbo from which we can self-righteously proclaim our independent position while, at the same time, begging the members of the Union to provide us with the financial and other benefits of membership. Our self-respect alone should preclude us from choosing the latter course of action.</P>
    <P>June the 18th will be an historic day for Ireland and, to a degree, for Europe. It is not part of my vision of Europe to suggest a limited or restricted role for Maastricht. Frankly, I see it as a step towards a federal Europe. I can foresee the evolution of the United States of Europe with European democratic institutions, a genuine federal budget and <Col N="173" /> automatic transfers from richer to poorer states. I accept that it will be many more years before this vision comes to fruition but I do hope to see it in my lifetime.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the issue of sovereignty. I am of the view that being in the Community increases our effective sovereignty. We now have, and will have, a voice in all the major decisions being taken at European level, decisions which have a major influence on our life as a nation. In addition, through the EC we have a voice in decisions taken at international level. The best current example is to be found in the GATT negotiations which are of enormous importance to our country, especially to our farmers. How could we effectively get a response to our concerns on these issues without EC backing?</P>
    <P>Our effective economic sovereignty will be enhanced also through Economic and Monetary Union, one of the central components of the new Treaty. European Monetary Union offers the prospect of economic growth and increased employment for both Ireland and Europe. As a country which exports 75 per cent of what it produces to the EC, obviously the economic growth of the Community is of vital importance to us as an exporting nation for the prize of European Monetary Union is increased growth, lower inflation and lower interest rates. Given our large national debt, lower interest rates will assist in reducing that debt, in turn liberating more resources for job creation.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the central issue: what is the priority problem confronting us in Ireland today? The answer is jobs, or the lack of them. We now have an unemployment rate of 21 per cent with over 280,000 of our people out of work. Any consideration of European Union must cause us to examine its implications for jobs. It would be a serious mistake to expect Europe to provide a solution to our jobs crisis. Yet my contention is that, in the context of Europe, in particular guaranteed access to the largest market in the world, and the supports that are and will be available to us as a member <Col N="174" /> of the European Union, we can come to terms with that jobs crisis.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of a well educated workforce I am especially happy with the reference to education in the Treaty; it is limited but is a start. We have a young population. Historically, because of financial constraints, we have had under-investment in education. The prospect of even beginning to tap into European funding for educational purposes is a major plus but let me sound a warning: Europe will not solve our jobs crisis for us.</P>
    <P>Much is made at European level of the principle of subsidiarity. That subject is not recognised in Ireland even though the principle goes back to <i>Rerum novarum</i> in 1891. Despite that we have the most centralised bureaucratic system in Europe. We have not adopted either the theory or practice of regionalisation even though we are quite happy to benefit from the Regional Fund. We miss the point. We will not get the advantage of regionalisation in jobs terms until we are prepared to adopt the concept and put in place regional structures within Ireland. Fine Gael have proposed a very specific model on that very point; I would commend the Government to read carefully the publication we issued yesterday which included that point. I believe the Government will continue to wonder why our unemployment figures continue to soar unless they are prepared to change direction on this score.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is in our interest to take advantage of the benefits of European Union to come to terms with the jobs crisis. It is also very much in our interest to have a united and interdependent Europe. To coin a phrase, peace has broken out in western Europe since the foundation of the European Community. Centuries of wars, from Napoleon and before, to Bismarck, to the Great War and the Second World War thankfully are now but a sad historic memory. However, now more than ever with such instability in Central and Eastern Europe, do we need a solidly peaceful European Union.</P>
    <P>I suppose the other great issue included <Col N="175" /> in the Treaty is the establishment of a single currency which has not received sufficient attention in debates to date. I am convinced that the establishment of a single European currency will render it easier, particularly for a trading nation like ours, to grow and help us in our quest to provide employment for our people. I suppose it is fair to say, as was mentioned by the Taoiseach, to corroborate this, that when one goes abroad, the fact that the Irish punt is not so well known internationally means one is changing it both ways, coming and going, which would not apply so much to sterling or the Deutsche-Mark, so that we would gain particularly from the change to a single European currency.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is in our interests to have a strong European authority to control transboundary pollution, unfair competition and exploitation of strength by large countries at the expense of small countries like ours. Frankly, I cannot understand the opposition of a party like the Greens to Maastricht in view of their interest in the environment. We have some hope of coping with problems like Sellafield with EC help; we have none, as records to date have shown, alone. In the Treaty strong emphasis is laid on the environment. I would have thought that would have attracted support from those with an interest in the environment.</P>
    <P>Taking an overview, I like the philosophy of a European Union which is not selfish and inward looking, which is prepared to play its part in the search for peace in the world and which has an unselfish approach to the Third World. It is now estimated that 40 per cent of Official Development Assistance in the world is sourced in the European Community. The Lomé agreements have been revolutionary in their approach, not least in recognising the rights and responsibilities of independent developing countries. At a time when there is so much emphasis on what we can gain from the Community there also should be an emphasis as to what we, who have not been doing very well on our own, can do with our partners in that European Union <Col N="176" /> to resolve the problems of the Third World.</P>
    <P>If the Treaty on European Union is rejected it will bring about the most serious political and economic crisis since the foundation of the State. Frankly speaking, there is no such thing as an each way bet on this issue. I will resist the temptation of commenting on the Taoiseach's suggestion that the Labour Party were having a Euro dollar each way on the issue. I will leave it to Deputy Spring to deal with that, but my own view is that there is no such thing as an each way bet on this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are either for European Union and all that goes with it or we are against it and must take the consequences. My criticism of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government and the tabling by me of an amendment to the Bill is not because we in Fine Gael are opposed to the Bill. On the contrary, this approach was adopted because we are so committed to European Union. In particular, we are concerned that the referendum on 18 June to ratify the change in the Constitution may be put at risk because of confusion on the travel and information issues. Recent opinion poll results must not lead us into a false sense of security about the outcome of the referendum. To be blunt about it, the Maastricht Treaty can be defeated. We should remember the opinion polls held before the divorce referendum. Indeed, the recent UK general election is a more up-to-date example of how the polls got it all wrong. In any event, and even taking into account the figures in the opinion poll, there is no measure of those who will not bother to vote at all. In the end, apathy could be the biggest opponent of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main opposition to Maastricht is not based on the aims or principles of the Treaty but rather on the issue of abortion. Because of Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats incompetence, people may vote against our national and economic best interests for unreal but <Col N="177" /> sincere moral reasons. In this context, the Government have a duty to clear up the travel and information issues so that those who hold strong views on them can vote on the Maastricht Treaty solely on its merits. The Government have allowed abortion and Maastricht to become two sides of the same coin. It is clear that when the Government inserted the Protocol last November without any discussion in this House &mdash; I have been told that there was no discussion in Cabinet either, but that is neither here nor there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not pointing a finger at the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am saying it is clear that the Government inserted the Protocol last November with a view to ensuring that Maastricht did not become entangled with abortion. That is the only logical conclusion to which I can come. Even on the Government's own logic, the abortion matter must be separated from Maastricht. It is illogical to hold the referendum on travel, counselling and information after the vote on Maastricht. The Minister seems to accept that the Government are being totally inconsistent with their present position in refusing to clear up that issue before the vote on European Union. If the Government do not hold the referendum on abortion first there is no reason why they cannot give the proposed wording for travel and information at this stage, and certainly before 18 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remind the Government that they were very quick to produce a revised wording for the Protocol and a further wording in the light of the Fine Gael proposal. The Government have at their disposal all the resources necessary, including the Civil Service, the Attorney General and others, to produce such a wording. They have no excuse for not doing this. It occurred to me that even the Progressive Democrats who do not seem to be short of constitutional experts, and who are bombarding the <Col N="178" /> national press with learned articles, might be able to help in producing a wording. Publicity this week about a possible further injunction being taken out to prevent a woman travelling abroad for an abortion &mdash; I do not wish to comment on this case as I do not have the specific details &mdash; reinforces the arguments I am making in support of the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government seem to be prepared to imperil Maastricht with the issue of abortion must inexorably lead one to the conclusion that they do not know what to do about these issues or, if they do know, they do not for some reason or other have sufficient trust in the people to tell them. The Government have asked the people to trust them on the issues of travel and information. How can the people have any trust in the Government when the Progressive Democrats Leader, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his conference speech on Saturday night, expressed, by implication, a complete lack of confidence in the actions of the Attorney General over the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case. In fact, he said: &ldquo;the unfortunate and unbelievable `X' case should never have happened&rdquo;. I am not saying that Deputy O'Malley has expressed a view with which I disagree but I am saying that the Attorney General whom he is, by implication criticising, is the legal adviser to the Government of whom he forms a part; it will be on his advice that the Government will proceed. What sort of confidence can people have in a decision emanating from that background?</P>
    <P>My fundamental contention is that it is very clearly in Ireland's national interest that the Treaty on European Union is ratified and, accordingly, that everything within reason that can be done should be done to ensure that ratification. This is why I, on behalf of Fine Gael, tabled an amendment to the Bill. The correct procedure would be to hold the referendum on travel, counselling and information before the Maastricht referendum. Another possibility would be to hold the two referendums simultaneously. In practical terms, it is clear <Col N="179" /> from the Government's attitude that this is not going to be done. Accordingly, my amendment was essentially designed to get the Government to produce a wording for the referendum which will be necessary to resolve the travel, counselling and information issues. If the Government are wise, they will accept the amendment and produce the wording. By not doing so, they are endangering our vital national interest.</P>
    <P>One way or the other &mdash; perhaps more so if the Government persist with their present course of action because of the dangers associated therewith &mdash; Fine Gael will campaign vigorously for a yes vote to ensure that the Treaty on European Union is carried. I am utterly convinced of the benefits of membership. I should say I am also convinced that Ireland has a contribution to make to Europe. At times it can be far too one-sided to concentrate the arguments solely on what we can get out of Europe. It would be altogether wrong for European Union to be sold solely on a pork barrel basis. It is correct that we gain enormously in financial terms from the Community, even at present. This figure is almost £2,000 million a year in net terms. We get this money every year. I think the contribution last year was £348 million. While much is made of the fact that there is a proposal for additional funding and disputation as to whether that figure will be fully obtained, it is the wrong approach. That issue matters nought in the context of the fundamental principle as to whether we should be part of European Union. I believe the Government have made a miscalculation in attempting to convince people to vote for Maastricht on the basis of additional moneys which they cannot guarantee.</P>
    <P>The better approach, which I recommend for the future as we approach June, is to indicate the track record to date, the increasing annual financial benefits to the country and the prospects that these benefits will continue to increase, even though the amounts cannot be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> It is very necessary to bring home to the people what European Union is all about rather than to be side-tracked into talk about abortion, which it most definitely is not about, or indeed to be seduced by prospects of a honey-pot with a perpetual supply of funding to meet our needs. The Maastricht Treaty essentially amends the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act and introduces new powers in policy areas. The result is that the EC is in effect changing its Constitution to give it power to do things for which it does not currently have authority. It is in our interest that that power and authority be given to the European Community and that the people should understand fully what will happen as a result of this change.</P>
    <P>The main aspects that will be changed by the new Treaty are Economic and Monetary Union, European citizenship, foreign and security policy and the role of the European Parliament. There will also be changes in EC powers in relation to consumer policy, education &mdash; to which I have referred &mdash; and health. In addition, an agreement on social policy by 11 of the 12 member states is included in a Protocol to the Treaty.</P>

      <P>The Minister is welcome to that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point that is overlooked is that when the Treaty is ratified Irish people will legally be both citizens of Ireland and citizens of Europe. The concept of joint European and Irish citizenship is an exciting one and one which is instinctively <Col N="181" /> understood by our young people who already see themselves as citizens of Europe. They will be extremely interested to learn that in the Maastricht Treaty the Treaty makers and we, the politicians, have caught up with them.</P>
    <P>The extension of the rights of citizens arises in a number of respects which are clearly spelled out in various documents. There is the right to travel freely &mdash; that matter has received much publicity &mdash; and the right to live in any member state. Essentially what we must bear in mind is that the Union involves the Community becoming more democratic and accountable, with greater powers being given to the European Parliament &mdash; many of us would like to see that Parliament getting even more powers &mdash; and with greater emphasis on decisions being made at regional and local level.</P>
    <P>A further aspect of the Treaty that is not fully understood is that it is essentially composed of three pillars which contain the elements of European Union. My personal preference would have been that all these matters come within the Community, but the three pillar approach was adopted. That includes the European Community itself, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and co-operation on justice, home affairs and emigration. The European Community will, therefore, be part of the overall tripartite structure of Europen Union.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of how we achieve all this. We should recall that any amendment to the Treaty of Rome must be made under Article 236 of that Treaty which provides that amendments shall be determined by &ldquo;common accord&rdquo; by representatives of the Governments of the member states. Thus the short answer to the consequences of non-ratification by Ireland is that the existing Treaty on European Union could not enter into force at all as the requirements of Article 236 could not have been met. The opponents of the Treaty glibly state that this would mean that the whole Treaty would have to be renegotiated within the EC, with Ireland then opting out of any defence commitments or other <Col N="182" /> aspects which it did not like. I utterly reject this viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Community would not allow Ireland to halt the tide of integration in this way and that the remaining member states would negotiate a new Treaty which presumably would not differ significantly from the existing Treaty on European Union. At that point Ireland would have two choices. Either it could leave the Community altogether or it could attempt to remain in the Community without progressing any further. Either course of action would have very serious implications for our country. Very quickly we would become a member of the Community in name only, that is even if the other EC member states were happy to allow Ireland to remain in the Community without signing a new Treaty.</P>
    <P>There is a worse scenario to contemplate; we would not have a new Treaty but because of the position in Germany, who have their own difficulties arising from unification, the full cost of which is only now being realised, it could be the beginning of an unravelling of the European Community. That is a prospect too horrible even to contemplate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am outlining a possible scenario that might arise from what is happening in Germany. Chancellor Kohl is one of those who were very involved in ensuring that the Treaty was put in place. The position in Germany is very different now and I am concerned that not alone would the Treaty not go through but that the entire European Community would begin to unravel. I accept that that is unlikely but it is a risk I would not be prepared to take. It is even worse than the other scenario I painted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some opponents of Maastricht are urging a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote because of Ireland's so called policy of neutrality. Fine Gael reject this approach for the following reasons. First though the European Community <Col N="183" /> has evolved and developed since World War II our concept of neutrality has not. The fact is that a World War II concept of neutrality has little or no meaning in the modern world. Because of our commitment under the present EC Treaty, and our membership of the UN, Ireland is no longer, strictly speaking, &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; at all. Second, the Maastricht Treaty does not contain any commitment to a military alliance. The Treaty provides for a further intergovernmental conference in 1996. However, Fine Gael believe that in the evolution of all aspects of the Community, including the possible development of a Common Defence Policy, Ireland should participate fully and present our individual viewpoint as to how we would like such policies to develop. Representations by an empty chair is not in our national interest. Third, in the meantime, the Treaty recognises our current position on military alliances.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to confront a variety of allegations. There is no decision on a Common Defence Policy, as has been alleged. There are no obligations in relation to conscription or anything of that kind. In any event &mdash; this is perhaps one of the most compelling arguments in favour of the Union &mdash; it is interesting to see in the queue of states wishing to join the European Union and waiting to see the Treaty in place before their applications are considered, many countries with widely differing views on military alliances and in particular neutrality, including Finland, Austria, Sweden, Norway and possibly even Switzerland. Those who are urging a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote to European Union will have to explain why the parts of Europe that are presently excluded from the EC all want to be part of European Union. Indeed, there are other countries, other than the ones I have just mentioned such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic States, which ultimately want to become a member of the EC. A Minister from Cyprus who was here during the week was making the case for them to join the EC. Both Malta and Turkey wish to join the Community.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to neutral states. I am just referring to the queue of countries who want to join a European Union, some in military alliances and others having different versions of neutrality. The question I would ask those who urge a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote is, why is it that everybody else seems to be out of step except our Johnny, who wants to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important in stressing the need for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to make it clear that Europe does not have all the answers to Ireland's problems. It will be a matter for ourselves to find those answers: but whether from the point of view of access to the Single Market, access to the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy, support from the Structural and Cohesion Funds or otherwise, clearly it will be far easier for Ireland to find a solution to our problems with that kind of support. Without it, we will be depriving ourselves of the instruments and the wherewithal to find a solution to our problems. Above all we will be closing the door to international mobile investment which will be tempted to use Ireland as a bridgehead to Europe and, furthermore, be putting at risk the many jobs we have attracted here already for that very reason. I attended a meeting in Cork last night and referred to a proposal from Taiwan to establish an industrial park in Ringaskiddy, which it is hoped will create 2,000 jobs, but the company are doing so on the basis of establishing a bridgehead to Europe. In fact they propose to turn the sod in that development in July of this year. I am quite sure the green field site will stay green if there is an overwhelming &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the Maastricht referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remaining in the Community though not bound by the Maastricht Treaty would leave Ireland in a political and economic backwater while the rest of the Community developed in the post-Maastricht era. This would have the following consequences: first, in the post-Maastricht Community the Community institutions &mdash; the Commission, the Council <Col N="185" /> of Ministers, and the European Parliament &mdash; would be engaged in implementing the terms of the Treaty. Because we in Ireland rejected the Maastricht Treaty our MEPs and Government Ministers would have no involvement in this and thus Ireland would become politically irrelevant. Second, post-Maastricht Community legislation would have no application in Ireland and thus the benefits of European Monetary Union would not apply in Ireland. This would clearly damage Ireland economically and would be an effective barrier to any other foreign investment in this country. Third, Ireland would not receive any of the payments from the Cohesion Fund and would have no case for a share in the proposed substantial increase in the existing Structural Fund.</P>
    <P>An aspect which has not had any publicity is the effect of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote on our relationship with Northern Ireland. If European Union comes to fruition both parts of Ireland will ultimately be contiguous regions in a united Europe. This opens up many possibilities for a solution to our historic problem on this island. Apart from the territorial problem, I recently saw a survey on the prospects of a huge increase in jobs North and South if the potential for trade between the two parts of our island is fully exploited. In a speech on 24 October last Mr. Liam Connellan, Director General of the CII said:</P>
    <P>The completion of the Single Market in the European Community will also result in a single market on the island of Ireland for the first time in living memory. Manufacturers in the Republic sell only a quarter as much in Northern Ireland as they do in the Republic when on the basis of the relative populations they should be able to sell half as much. The comparisons for Northern manufacturers are even more dramatic. Northern Ireland manufacturers sell only a third as much in the Republic as they do in Northern Ireland although the population of the Republic is twice as great. If similar penetration of market could be <Col N="186" /> achieved by each part of the island in the other part, this would result in increased business for Irish manufacturers, North and South, of £3 billion and at least 75,000 additional jobs on the island.</P>

      <P>I wanted to comment in particular on the benefits politically and economically to all the people on this island if we are part of European Union. This has received little notice but I feel very strongly that it cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the other side of the coin, let us imagine a situation where the Maastricht Treaty is passed by the House of Commons in London but is rejected in the Republic on 18 June 1992. This would mean that the two parts of Ireland would have a different category of membership of the European Community. This would turn the Border into a major political and economic frontier. Not alone would the benefits arising from full penetration of the Single Market be lost, we would see the prospects of a solution to the political problem recede more and more into the distance. This is a further compelling argument for voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>The case for joining the European Union is absolutely compelling. That is why I have been so concerned at the way in which the Government have endangered our vital national interest by their mishandling of the debate to date. Let me clearly put on record that despite this fact Fine Gael, as the main Opposition party, urge the mobilisation of maximum support for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat a statement I made yesterday on European Union. In the detailed analysis of Maastricht prepared by the Labour Party which is being published today the party recommend that the people of Ireland should vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Maastricht. <Col N="187" /> However, we are going further than that. We are calling for a substantial campaign by the Irish Government backed up by the whole community to make the Treaty work for every citizen of Europe. Voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the hope that there is a pot of gold in Maastricht is just not enough.</P>
      <P>If and when the Treaty is ratified by the Twelve, the campaign for improvements must go on. Over the past few weeks and especially last weekend I have heard suggestions from a number of people who ought to know better that the Maastricht Treaty offers us some sort of European heaven on earth. The Leader of the Progressive Democrats, for example, accused those of us on the Left who have been critical of the whole Maastricht process of distorting reality. It is those politicians who are campaigning for an uncritical endorsement of the Treaty who are distorting reality. Ireland will face enormous challenges after we vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Maastricht; to pretend otherwise is foolish, dangerous and dishonest.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht process can lead to a more prosperous Europe &mdash; but much remains to be done if that prosperity is to be spread fairly throughout the regions of Europe. Maastricht must not be allowed to enrich the few at the expense of the many. In that context it must be recognised that there are many instruments in the Maastricht Treaty that will enable wealth creation. The continuing process must add instruments to enable the fair distribution of that extra wealth so that citizens and workers benefit.</P>
      <P>In our detailed commentary, we have called for the following specific things:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland should lead a major campaign seeking the inclusion of full employment as a specific Community objective, and demanding the adoption of policies based on State and Community involvement in working towards that objective. We must recognise that Ireland will have to fight, together with other less developed regions of the Community, for proper funding for the Structural and Cohesion <Col N="188" /> Funds. The proposed budget of 1.3 per cent of Community GNP by 1997, even if it is achieved, is still not enough. Efforts must be redoubled in Ireland to ensure that indigenous industry is enabled to compete effectively in the new environment. This can only be done by an unprecedented emphasis on excellence of product, efficiency of manufacture, high quality marketing, and reliability of supply. This will involve a major test of leadership and a united effort here at home. The Social Chapter of the Treaty will need immediate strengthening. The Irish Government, no more than any other, must not be allowed to dodge the objective of the Social Chapter, which is to promote &ldquo;employment, improved living and working conditions, proper social protection... the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion&rdquo;. The original Social Charter, with its commitment to children, the elderly, and other citizens apart from those at work, must be got back on the European agenda. A common defence policy for Europe is on a future European agenda, and decisions on the issue will face us in 1996. Ireland must prepare for that debate. We can influence the debate about militarism, if we work hand in hand with the other neutral countries that have applied to join the Community. It is true that some members of the Community harbour ambitions to turn the European Union into the European pillar of NATO. But a bloc of four &mdash; possibly five, if Switzerland is included &mdash; neutral members will have their own strongly held views on Cold War military alliances. Our task will be to work with the other neutrals to develop policies for peaceful security. The extent to which we succeed will be judged by the people in another referendum. The European institutions remain insufficiently democratic and accountable after Maastricht. The proceedings of the various Councils of Ministers must be open to more public scrutiny and understanding. The balance of power between the directly-elected Parliament and the different levels of the European executive must be taken far <Col N="189" /> more seriously than to date. Ireland should actively campaign for a procedure whereby any future treaties on integration should be democratically endorsed by referendum in each member state, enabling Europe to be constructed by its citizens and not just by officials and those politicians who happen to be in office at a given time.</P>
    <P>In the statement I issued yesterday, I also made the point that for many citizens, this whole debate will be overshadowed by the issues of travel and information brought up by the outcome of the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case. Again I repeat that it is fundamentally dishonest to claim, as the Government and the Taoiseach have done again and again, that there is no link between the Maastricht Treaty and the rights of travel and information. Protocol 17 was inserted at the request of the Irish Government precisely to protect the operation of Article 40.3.3º, and the result is this: in normal circumstances, EC law would almost certainly over-rule any attempt to prevent a woman from travelling abroad for purposes lawful in the Community. The effect of the Protocol is certainly to prevent any European Court challenge to the law on abortion in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That Protocol was not inserted because of an overwhelming demand in Ireland, or because Europe wanted it. It was inserted in secrecy to appease a small and voluble section of Irish opinion, and it has now exploded in the face of the Government. It is worth pointing out that both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were responsible for its insertion into the Treaty, and both must now carry responsibility for the disaster that has resulted.</P>
    <P>For many citizens, and for many members of the Labour Party, the existence of the Protocol in its unamended form presents a dilemma of conscience. Put simply, it is not possible for many people to vote for a Treaty in which the rights of Irish women will be less in law than those of every other citizen in Europe. That dilemma cannot be resolved by a bland assertion by Fianna <Col N="190" /> Fáil, in particular, that they can be trusted to set the issue right in the future.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in Fianna Fáil's history or record to suggest that they can be trusted not to capitulate to pressure groups on this issue, once the Maastricht Treaty is out of the way. People who are legitimately concerned about this issue, and particularly women, are entitled to demand more. The harmful effect of the Protocol on the right to travel and information, and the lack of reassurance to be found in the inconsistent and chaotic way in which the Government have handled the issue over the last number of weeks have given rise to a feeling in many quarters that the Protocol must be defeated.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be moving its Private Members' Bill on these issues on Tuesday week in the Dáil. We will be seeking an agreement between the party Whips, as we are entitled to do under the Standing Orders of the Dáil, to limit debate on the Bill to three hours instead of the usual six. That will mean that a vote on the principles of the Bill will take place on Wednesday week 13 May.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Bill, the purpose of which is to copperfasten the rights that are threatened by the Protocol, we will be making it clear that we are willing to work with every other party in the Dáil to improve the details of the Bill on Committee Stage. I would go further: if the Bill is accepted in principle, we will not seek to have the Bill dealt with on Committee Stage until the Maastricht referendum is completed. If the Government were in turn to agree to support or adopt the Bill in principle on Second Stage, it would enable the great majority of people to make the investment of trust that the Government have been seeking in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>The Government have promised a referendum in the autumn on these issues. Therefore, there is no good reason for them to refuse to support our Bill in principle. If they do so, they will be making the kind of gesture that needs to be made now. If they fail to do so, the only outcome will be that they will inspire yet more distrust.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> If the Treaty of Maastricht is to mean anything, it must mean an equality of citizenship. For as long as Irish women are described in the Treaty and its Protocol as having fewer rights than every other citizen of Europe, there will be many who will feel, perfectly legitimately, that they must withhold support from the process. Today, of all days, it ought to be obvious that this issue is not going to simply go away.</P>
    <P>Today, the newspapers are full of news of another attempt to deprive a woman of her basic rights. By all accounts, the Chief State Solicitor, who reports directly to the Attorney General, is considering the options open to him. We know from every statement so far attributed to the Attorney General that he feels he has no discretion on the issue until the people magically give him this discretion by voting yes on 18 June.</P>
    <P>So let us not fool ourselves that this issue will simply go away if we choose to ignore it. It will not go away &mdash; and it should not. The only way in which the Protocol and its effects can be removed for all time as a cloud over women in Ireland is through action here at home and by this Parliament. Before leaving this issue, I want to make it clear that I believe there is room for general agreement in this House and, indeed, by the political parties on the issue.</P>
    <P>When the text of our Bill was published, our spokesperson and party Whip, Deputy Brendan Howlin, sent a copy to the Taoiseach, among others. We have received a reply from the Taoiseach. That reply gives me some grounds for hope that an all-party consensus can still be reached, and I intend to pursue the matter further with the Taoiseach. I intend too to involve the leaders of the other parties in the House in those discussions.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that by next Tuesday, based on what the Taoiseach has told us in his letter it will be possible to tell the House that there is now a crossparty commitment, suitably expressed and copperfastened by the whole House, that the rights of women in relation to <Col N="192" /> the issues of travel and information will be fully protected. Clearly, agreement depends on the willingness of all parties to agree &mdash; and not simply to demand unearned trust at this stage.</P>
    <P>The issues of travel and information are extremely urgent, for the simple reason that it is not connected in any way to the Maastricht Protocol, as travel and information is. For that reason, I emphasise again the fundamental urgency of dealing with the issue of travel and information now, at least in principle, and of dealing with it in a way that will not allow the principle to be diluted at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to deal with the other aspects in detail, I want to elaborate on the point I made earlier about security and foreign policy. The main political development contained in the Maastricht Treaty is the Common Foreign and Security Policy which is to remain intergovernmental in character although considerably strengthened in its scope and application.</P>
    <P>It is not part of the European Community or of its decision-making processes and is not subject to judicial review or legal interpretation by the Court of Justice. It is an adjunct to it, involving different processes, and as such is a separate and new part of the new European Union. I am glad that the point I raised in this House last week about the wording of the referendum has induced and forced an explanatory memorandum which was presented today and which makes it clear that it is not intended to ask the people to vote for a situation in which acts done by the Western European Union will have the force of law in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the common policy, or CFSP as it is called, particularly as they apply to enhancing the prospects of peace and common security, conform with the Labour Party's main international policy goals, as set out repeatedly over the years in our policy documents and in many speeches and statements.</P>
    <P>The Union has set itself the objective in the Treaty to assert its identity on the international scene, particularly through the implementation of the Common <Col N="193" /> Foreign and Security Policy, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to common defence.</P>
    <P>Clearly this is an issue meriting particular attention in a neutral country such as Ireland. Proposals on a common defence policy are to be submitted by the Foreign Ministers to the Heads of State and Governments sitting as the European Council and their conclusions, if any, could then be put to a new Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 for adoption on the basis of unanimity. In the meantime while the Maastricht Treaty remains in force, the traditional foreign policies of member states are to be respected, which includes Ireland's policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>It is further provided that the Union, acting by unanimity, may request the Western European Union &mdash; seen as the European arm of the Atlantic alliance and to which nine EC member states belong &mdash; to &ldquo;elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications&rdquo;. Such requests in areas like peacekeeping will also be decided at Council by unanimity.</P>
    <P>While it is true that Maastricht does nothing to change the defence policies of the member states in respect of their membership of the Union about to be created, it nonetheless puts a common defence policy on a future agenda by 1996.</P>
    <P>During that time it is anticipated that membership of the new European Union will have been expanded to include most of the EFTA states, including at least three neutrals. The Intergovernmental Conference to be held about 1996 will therefore have a much larger component of neutral member states than at present.</P>
    <P>It is even conceivable that the three Central European states of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary could be present as observers in keeping with their potential membership by the end of this decade. They would add force to a viewpoint more in keeping with Ireland's traditional policy rather than that held by those who favour the NATO-style approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> The judgment that Ireland's neutrality will remain intact until such time as a new treaty to the contrary has been ratified by the Irish people at some future date is shared by the Governments and social democratic parties in the three neutrals of Austria, Sweden and Finland. All three have applied for membership of the Community and on becoming members would have to accept the Maastricht Treaty. All three have indicated their willingness to do so without reservations on their neutrality status.</P>
    <P>It remains true that some existing member states harbour ambitions to turn the European Union into the European pillar of NATO. It is also true that others have a different viewpoint. It is evident that a block of four neutrals, possibly five, will have their strongly held principles on Cold War military alliances.</P>
    <P>All this indicates, particularly as the Western European Union treaty is due to expire in 1998, that security issues involving defence policy will be intensely debated in Europe over this decade.</P>
    <P>These prospects underline the great changes which have taken place within Europe during the past three years and which have fundamentally altered Cold War politics. They have also transformed the context in which collective security within a broader Europe is to be achieved, as is underlined by the opening this week of the 51 nation CSCE conference in Helsinki.</P>
    <P>It is in the light of these new realities that it is possible to conclude that the Maastricht Treaty <i>per se</i> will not endanger Irish neutrality in the period leading up to another Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>A Common Foreign and Security Policy in an enlarged Union could provide Ireland, in concert with other neutrals with the framework for developing new security policies in keeping with the changed circumstances. The extent to which that is achieved can best be judged by the Irish people in a subsequent referendum.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, I do not believe that acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty poses imminent dangers to out <Col N="195" /> neutrality, notwithstanding reservations about the as yet unresolved future roles of both the Western European Union and NATO.</P>
    <P>The recent emergence of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council with its potential for involving the whole of Europe, including the republics of the CIS who are participants, reinforces the belief that Irish involvement in the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy could be judged as a welcome and positive development. I wish to enter this important caveat &mdash; the fundamental goal of Irish policy should be to contribute to the evolution of the European Community as a genuine zone of peace, not alone within Europe but within the wider world setting.</P>
    <P>The history of the Community, and its true inspiration, has been marked by a concern with issues of economic and social justice and of balanced world development. It has also served to create the conditions of trust which have ended for all time the historic and bloody confrontation of France and Germany. It would be tragic, misguided and not conducive to the development of a Community likely to command widespread popular support if that legacy were to be dissipated in the pursuit of hasty and ill-considered military entanglements.</P>
    <P>However, the development of the Community after Maastricht is clearly in the direction of a closer political economic and social unity. The very concept of European Union and European citizenship underlines these trends. Ireland must be prepared to accept appropriate responsibilities in the foreign policy and security areas including those which result from international law, for example duties arising from Chapter Seven of the UN Charter. In doing so however, we must be true to our own principles, and we must remain outside any military arrangement contrary to those principles.</P>
    <P>In the period up to 1996 Ireland must argue and work, in close co-operation with like-minded member states and notably with new arrivals such as <Col N="196" /> Sweden, Austria and Finland, for acceptable and progressive common policies capable of providing the whole of Europe with genuine security, disarmament and development and reducing defence policy and provisions to the minimum levels necessary to ensure peace and justice. In doing so, we will have the support of every social democratic party in Europe.</P>
    <P>We have never taken seriously enough the need to develop a coherent foreign policy position for Ireland, one that combines principle with the pursuit of our interests. Over the next few years, if we are not to be swallowed up in the debate about common security and defence, we are going to have to do so.</P>
    <P>In that context, Ireland's stance in international, and above all European, matters must contain the following key elements: any CFSP must make the Community a force for peace, disarmament, co-operation and European &ldquo;inclusiveness&rdquo;; we need European institutions to bring together all those countries which wish to participate; foreign policy must be underpinned by the extension and guarantee of political self-determination, freedom and human rights across Europe and throughout the world; the EC must accept the membership applications of Sweden and Austria and prepare the ground for further enlargement, especially in the East; a fundamental aim must be the goal of complete nuclear disarmament and rejection of all nuclear weapons; we must ensure that its own basic military security needs are adequately met; we must remain firmly outside any military pact or alliance based on Cold War structures such as NATO and the Western European Union, accepting a military role only in the context of an all-European structure of defence based on the UN Charter or CSCE-type arrangements and any such arrangement must be defensive, non-nuclear, firmly based on human rights and development principles; we must reject any form of European order which would reflect former colonial aspirations or ties and which could lead to adventurism outside Europe; the principle of <Col N="197" /> solidarity with Third World countries must be respected; Ireland should participate fully in disarmament talks in all appropriate fora and seek to play an active role as a promoter of peace; we should be prepared to redouble our commitment to peacekeeping; we must campaign for a recognition that Europe's dramatic changes have not lessened the plight of the Third World nor Europe's responsibilities there; we must return to our former commitment to UN aid targets and Ireland should insist on the strengthening and support of the UN organisation as the best hope for peace and security throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline our views on the economic and monetary aspects of the Treaty. The section of the Treaty dealing with the expansion of the European Community lists 20 areas of activities, some of which are added for the first time. The more important is the commitment to create an economic and monetary union. The main economic proposal in the Treaty is the intention to create an economic and monetary union by 1999 at the latest. This raises three fundamental issues: the effect on peripheral regions; the conditions for entry into the final stage and the impact on employment throughout the EC.</P>
    <P>The effect on peripheral regions is of particular relevance to Ireland for obvious reasons. While I accept that the Single Market created by the SEA logically requires a common monetary authority to control free capital movements as well as the eventual creation of a common currency, it is also clear on the basis of actual experience that European Monetary Union could severely disadvantage regions on the periphery of the central economy. This danger will not be adequately addressed until a Community budget is established which is proportionate to the needs of disadvantaged areas, peripheral regions and industrial sectors requiring modernisation.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty does not create a proper Community budget as proposed by various authoritative reports in the seventies. However, it establishes substantial new Cohesion Funds which are <Col N="198" /> to be concentrated on four countries, including Ireland. To that extent the Treaty creates the preconditions for an eventual Community budget based on the principles of fiscal federalism. This view is supported by the Commission in its Delors II package, where in its commentary on Economic and Social Cohesion, it states that the guidelines adopted by Maastricht foreshadow a Community acting with coherence and solidarity.</P>
    <P>The Treaty and its follow-up package in Delors II would go some way towards meeting the requirements of harmonious regional development by doubling the sums available under the Structural Funds. Nobody should assume, however, that this is guaranteed. I urge the Government to desist from trying to sell Maastricht on the basis that there is a big hand-out in store. It would be far more honest to try to build a consensus in Ireland around the need to fight for extra support, rather than behaving as if the cheque was already in the post.</P>
    <P>A framework with positive potential has been created, and the Cohesion Funds could offset to some extent the danger to peripheral regions if the scale of funding matches that put forward in the recent Delors II package. As I said, there are difficulties ahead in this regard due to German and UK opposition but similar difficulties were encountered and overcome in respect of the Structural Funds. A comparable outcome is likely, but by no means certain, on this occasion because of Irish and Spanish insistence on protecting their developing economies.</P>
    <P>Judgment on the first issue must be broadly positive, even though Maastricht will do no more that contribute modestly to the solution of our grievous unemployment problem. It would be prudent in assessing this judgment to assume that European Monetary Union will go ahead as planned and will very likely include between 15 to 20 member states by the end of this decade. Even if Ireland opted to stay outside that development it would be forced by economic circumstances to adhere to its monetary disciplines but, in <Col N="199" /> that instance, without any right of access to the Cohesion Funds.</P>
    <P>The second issue is the move towards the third or final stage of European Monetary Union which is to take place at the latest by 1999. The final stage will involve the establishment of the European Central Bank in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Treaty and will lead to the creation of a common currency some time afterwards. Entry to this stage will be on the basis of a member state meeting certain broad economic and budgetary criteria. Ireland could comply with all of these even now with the exception of the proposed debt/GDP ratio of 60 per cent. Such a ratio would be intrinsically valuable in itself because of reduced interest payments, but it is inconceivable that this figure could be secured by the end of the decade without massive deflation and serious repercussions for employment, as well as the level of public services.</P>
    <P>It is important that I spell out very clearly that the view of the Labour Party is simple: we will not tolerate any situation in which the necessary budgetary discipline is achieved at the expense of the weakest members of our community. In the last few years, fiscal rectitude has come to mean that people in need of housing, hospital beds or mental handicap services, are the ones who have been told time and again that the community must cut its cloth to suit its measure; the cuts that we have all become almost used to will pale into insignificance beside the cuts that will be necessary if the Government decide that they are going down this road. European membership means nothing if it is to mean that the most vulnerable are asked to subsidise the extra prosperity of the already well off.</P>
    <P>It seems, however, on the official advice available, that the debt-GDP ratio will be interpreted as a target towards which member states should be moving with a reasonable prospect of its achievement in the medium term post -1999. In those circumstances, the best strategy for this country is to pursue a policy of progressively lowering the ratio at a pace <Col N="200" /> which neither forces more harsh cuts in social services nor damages employment prospects. Logically, this should involve the Community providing medium-term assistance to the Irish Government so that the serious structural imbalance in our public finances can be corrected once and for all. Labour, therefore, recommend that in the context of the debate on Maastricht the Government should spell out this strategy and seek to have it accepted by the electorate and Government. It should then become an integral part of national strategy for the medium term. Such a strategy would correspond with the general thrust of national policy under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which already aims to progressively reduce the debt-GDP ratio, because it is unsustainably high and one of the worst in the Community. This will have to be achieved while keeping capital expenditure at levels consistent with the demands for increased investment. The proposed changes in the matching requirements of Structural and Cohesion Funds should assist that difficult balancing act.</P>
    <P>The third issue is the impact of European Monetary Union on employment policy. A major defect in the Treaty in terms of these provisions is that the monetary side of European Monetary Union is detailed, with a precise timetable; by contrast, the economic side is limited mainly to a set of budgetary rules which each member state must observe. These are clearly intended to ensure the smooth functioning of the money regime through the avoidance of large budgetary deficits. In fact, the budgetary policy of each member state will be subject to the surveillance by all the others, although it is not yet clear what action will be taken against a country breaking the rules.</P>
    <P>While it can be accepted as reasonable that a monetary union between many participants should require each to ensure stability in its internal monetary management, it is not acceptable that full employment has been omitted as a common Community priority. At present, unemployment is especially high in all member states and is the direct <Col N="201" /> cause of the rise of racism directed against the many immigrant populations spread throughout the Community. If unemployment continues to rise, so too will the political strength of right wing populism, with dangerous undertones of fascism and with an attendant threat to the essential democratic consensus within the Community. The failure to identify employment as a common policy area is also reflected in the industrial policy provisions of the Treaty expanding the competence of the Community. These are extremely modest judged against the scale of the problem and indicate a naive reliance on market forces as the means of creating jobs. They also prove, if proof were needed, that there are no credible policy initiatives on offer for reducing unemployment in the medium term.</P>
    <P>The absence of such policies is all the more serious given the observation that the objectives laid down for monetary stability could result in deflation throughout the Community as a whole. This danger could become acute when the Community embarks on the final stage of European Monetary Union and it is, therefore, essential that it should be tackled beforehand.</P>
    <P>The next stage in the integration process is scheduled for 1996 when a further Intergovernmental Conference is likely to be held and that could provide the opportunity for inserting a common objective to tackle unemployment in unison, and backing it up with credible macro economic strategies. Such an approach is strongly advocated in the relevant reports of the European Parliament committees dealing with Maastricht. At this stage, it cannot be forecast if that opportunity will be grasped. Much will depend on the combined political strength of Ireland and the other countries with whom it shares the crisis of unemployment at that Inter-governmental Conference and on experience in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Labour movement throughout Europe will have a major role to play too, in defeating the remaining influence of Thatcherism and Reaganism, and in replacing an unquestioning reliance on market forces with a new <Col N="202" /> vision of State and Community involvement in economic management. That challenge needs to be accepted in its own right even if Maastricht had never happened, but the urgency is all the greater in the context of ever-increasing interdependence between economies and in circumstances where the economies of Europe are being consciously fused together. The challenge is particularly pertinent in Ireland which has one of the most open economies in the world.</P>
    <P>In essence, the task facing all of us is to devise and implement full employment strategies. If that is not achieved, then the vigours of the final phase of European Monetary Union allied to a total reliance on competitive market forces could operate against employment generation. We in the Labour Party will devote the necessary time and resources for the development of policies on the economics of integration with particular emphasis on investment. We will be requesting the Socialist Group of the European Parliament, and the Confederation of Socialist Parties in Europe, to do likewise.</P>
    <P>In summary, the movement towards a common currency and a European Central Bank is probably irreversible, barring events which cannot be forecast at this time. Ireland should benefit more from being a participant in European Monetary Union than from remaining outside. However, the conditions of entry to the final stage will have to be framed so that they do not add to our unemployment problem. We must actively campaign for the inclusion of full employment as an explicit Community objective, and for the adoption of policies based on State and Community involvement.</P>
    <P>Economic and social cohesion is a stated objective of the Union as an integral part of promoting economic and social progress. The Delors II package is of direct relevance to the value to be attached to the Cohesion Fund, and has been described by the Commission as a logical continuation of the Maastricht decisions. The package itself deals with the financing of the Community from 1993 to 1997 and is designed to meet the three fundamental <Col N="203" /> challenges of that period: improving cohesion in the Community so that the maximum number of member states will be able to participate fully in the final stage of European Monetary Union; enabling European industry to face up to world competition; and allowing the Community to live up to its growing international responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The package proposes that the ceiling on Community resources which was set at 1.2 per cent of GNP for 1992 should be raised to 1.3 per cent by 1997. This would allow the budget to grow by 5 per cent per year in real terms. The proposed allocations of funds arising from this increase are: economic and social cohesion &mdash; 11 billion ECU; greater competitiveness &mdash; 3.5 billion ECU; and increased external action &mdash; 3.5 billion ECU.</P>
    <P>These proposals are to be discussed at the European Council this year, possibly in Lisbon in June, but more likely in Edinburgh in December. The Cohesion Fund is to be set up before 31 December 1993, according to the Protocol on Economic and Social Cohesion. If these proposals are accepted it would mean that for four countries &mdash; Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain &mdash; the resources available could rise by as much as 100 per cent. What is of importance in this context is that the Cohesion Fund is to operate as a means of helping the four countries to meet the convergence criteria which are a precondition for moving to the third stage of European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>The Commission will propose a regulation during the year on the establishment and operation of the Funds as it insists that substantial funds must be allocated to it, beginning in 1993.</P>
    <P>As mentioned previously, the Delors II package has met with initial hostility from Germany and the UK on the grounds that it is too generous. On the other hand a Community budget of 1.3 per cent of GNP is a far way off a proper federal budget which would demand over 4 per cent of GNP at the very least, and arguably more.</P>
    <P>Two judgments are called for here in <Col N="204" /> arriving at a conclusion. The first is political. The question is whether the European Council will agree to the Commission proposal. Despite current difficulties, especially in Germany, the answer would be yes on the basis of past experience and the existence of a Protocol on cohesion. There are those who will disagree and argue it will be much reduced.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we will not know the truth until after the referendum. It is for that reason that I have argued that it is dishonest for anyone to suggest that the extra funding will come our way without a struggle. If it is resisted to the point of being radically reduced, many people in Ireland will rapidly come to the conclusion that they have been sold a pup by the Government.</P>
    <P>The second question is whether the amounts are sufficient, if they are agree. The answer is likely to be that they would never be enough, given the scale of our combined unemployment and debt problems, but undoubtedly would be a valuable contribution to our national investment programme. For that pragmatic reason, the Commission proposals for the Cohesion Fund, but nothing less, should be accepted.</P>
    <P>The agreement by the Eleven on social policy applies to the minimum demands of the socialist and trade union movement as expressed by the party leaders of the Confederation of Socialist Parties. It strengthens the existing social provisions of the Treaty notably by extending qualified majority voting to areas such as the working environment, information and consultation of workers and equality.</P>
    <P>However, a number of important matters, such as social security, are still subject to the role of unanimity; and others, such as pay or trade union rights, are excluded from Community action.</P>
    <P>The text adopted by the Eleven accords special status to the role of the social partners and provides for endorsement by Council of agreements reached by the partners. This arrangement holds out the hope of progress on a range of <Col N="205" /> important issues such as training and technological development.</P>
    <P>The Social Chapter agreement may give rise to complexity and confusion in legal terms and it is essential that it is reflected in early and determined initiatives on the part of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>However, the Social Action Programme, implementing the Social Charter, can now be adopted and applied in full since the delays and obstructions occasioned by the UK attitudes can be ignored by member states. In the optimistic belief that this will now happen &mdash; and bearing in mind the statement of the executive committee of the ETUC that the trade union movement should support the ratification of the Treaty &mdash; the social agreement should be supported.</P>
    <P>It should not, however, be assumed that the Social Charter is now fully in place. Since its original inception, it has become a much watered-down document, especially where issues like the exploitation of children and the protection of old people are concerned. We have always described implementation of the full Social Charter as a battle still to be fought, and I am afraid that in many respects, that remains the case.</P>
    <P>In summary, what I have tried to outline in the course of my contribution is the result of careful and detailed analysis carried out by the Labour Party into all the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. At the end of the day, my party have come to the view, broadly speaking, that on balance we should support the Treaty. But that does not mean that we have abandoned our critical faculties. Much remains to be done if Maastricht is to work for all of Europe's citizens. We cannot assume that if we vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on 18 June we will have done all that is required of us.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I reiterate once more my absolute conviction that if this Government fail to address the issues of travel and information, as they apply to the rights of women in Ireland, the Government will be doing a grave disservice to women, to Ireland, and to this Treaty.</P>

      <P>Our amendment reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after `that' and substitute:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill until such time as the Treaty on European Union signed at Maastricht on the 7th day of February 1992 has been renegotiated to secure the following objectives:</P>
      <P>(a) the deletion of Protocol 17 in order to defend the rights of Irish women,</P>
      <P>(b) guarantees of adequate funding to assist Ireland in coping with the problems created for peripheral regions by economic union,</P>
      <P>(c) derogation from national budgetary limits which would result in unacceptable cutbacks in public spending on essential services,</P>
      <P>(d) an interventionist EC common industrial policy to help tackle our unemployment level which is now the worst in the Community, by seeking to bring jobs to people in Ireland, rather than sucking people from Ireland to the centre of the EC,</P>
      <P>(e) increased democratic accountability of all Community institutions, and of the new competencies such as foreign policy, security, justice and central banking,</P>
      <P>(f) an amended common foreign and security policy which would abandon superpower aspirations and be dedicated to the promotion of peace, operate under the umbrella of the CSCE and be committed to assisting developing countries as the best means of reducing the potential for conflict.</P>
      <P>Nobody can dispute that the decision the Irish people are being asked to make on 18 June is one of enormous importance, which will have a major impact on the economic, social and political life of this country and which will have particular implications for the status and rights of Irish women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> We will, of course, accept the democratic verdict of the people in the referendum on 18 June. But for people to be in a position to make an informed judgement on the issues before them, they must be in possession of all the facts. As I have said on many occasions, Maastricht is not a choice between black and white; it is neither all good nor all bad. We recognise that there are, indeed, positive aspects to the Maastricht Agreement, but there are also many shortcomings in the Treaty which will create great problems for Ireland. People are already being bombarded with an intensive propaganda campaign highlighting the potential benefits of Maastricht; they must also be told honestly about the downside, if the referendum is to be a truly democratic exercise of choice.</P>
    <P>There is also no doubt that the whole Maastricht issue has been complicated enormously by the abortion issue. From the very beginning Democratic Left urged that the abortion issue should be disentangled from Maastricht and that the Treaty should be judged solely on its economic, social and political implications. However, the spectacularly inept handling of the whole affair by the Taoiseach in recent weeks has ensured that abortion is going to play a major role in the referendum campaign and that the possible implications for freedom of information and the travel rights of women of passing the Treaty with the Protocol in place will be the decisive issue for many people when deciding how to cast their votes.</P>
    <P>The real tragedy is that this could have been avoided. It could have been avoided had the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, stood up to the ultra right wing of their party when they came last year demanding the inclusion of this Protocol which was clearly designed to prevent Irish women from seeking recourse to the European Court of Justice to establish their entitlement to equal rights as European citizens. It might even have been avoided had the matter been drawn to the attention of <Col N="208" /> the Government &mdash; Deputy O'Malley has said it never came before the Cabinet &mdash; or had the matter even been reported to the Dáil. Instead, the Protocol was negotiated and inserted in the clandestine and furtive way that was the mark of the Haughey Government.</P>
    <P>The situation might even have been rescued had the Government, in the aftermath of the tragic Attorney General <i>v</i> X case, negotiated the deletion of the Protocol. The Taoiseach has said that our EC partners would not have agreed to such a deletion, but it is now widely accepted that the Government never sought it. In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 29 April, Seán Flynn writing from Brussels said:</P>
    <P>It is clear however that the Government never sought to measure the true level of support for the deletion of the Protocol. After the Community refused to re-open the Treaty earlier this month, Mr. Andrews expressed the view that all options &mdash; including the deletion of the Protocol &mdash; were on the table. The deletion of the Protocol is also said to have been the option preferred by several diplomats in Brussels. But the Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds, favoured the alternative option of a solemn declaration.</P>
    <P>According to EC diplomats, the question of deleting the Protocol was not raised when the Attorney General, Mr. Harry Whelehan, met the head of the legal service of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Jean Claude Piris, in an attempt to resolve the abortion issue earlier this month.</P>
    <P>The same article states:</P>
    <P>In this context it is interesting to note that the British diplomats in Brussels were advised last month that a new Inter Governmental Conference would not be necessary to allow a Labour Government to delete the opt-out clause on social policy, as this would involve a return to the <i>status quo</i> under Community law.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Taoiseach to pursue <Col N="209" /> the option of deletion of the Protocol &mdash; as distinct from its amendment &mdash; is inexplicable. As Sean Flynn's article shows, there is a considerable body of respected legal and political opinion which believes that a simple request for deletion would have been agreed to by the other states, as this would have involved reverting only to the <i>status quo</i> and would not have involved opening the Pandora's Box, which, apparently, some European leaders believed would follow on from agreement to amend the Protocol.</P>
    <P>There is also a body of opinion which believes that Ireland could have unilaterally withdrawn the Protocol, as this would not affect the laws or constitutional position of any other country. Unfortunately, the Government seem to have considered every option except the most obvious one of deletion.</P>
    <P>Because of this, the reality is that people have to decide whether or not to vote for the Treaty which retains the Protocol as an integral part. Since the Protocol copperfastens the provisions of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution and since the High Court and a majority of members of the Supreme Court have decided that this restricts a woman's right to travel in certain circumstances, how can the Taoiseach expect us to believe that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will ensure the right to freedom of travel?</P>
    <P>The solemn legal declaration which the Taoiseach has put so much effort into selling to Irish women has no legal or constitutional standing. It will not be part of the Maastricht Treaty, nor will it be part of the interpretative annexe which the European Court is bound to take account of in delivering its judgments. It is simply a political statement. The former member of the European Court, Mr. Tom O'Higgins, has said that only in a case where there was absolutely nothing to choose between the two sides would such a declaration affect a decision by the court.</P>
    <P>We also know that the suggestion in the solemn declaration that it was never the intention of the member states that <Col N="210" /> the Protocol should be used to limit the right to travel is a crude attempt to rewrite recent history. In an article in the prestigious <i>Common Market Law Journal</i> published last January, before the X case came to light, under the heading &ldquo;Society for the Protection of the Unborn (SPUC) <i>v</i> Grogan&rdquo;, the editor had this to say:</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that no further challenge could be brought to the European Court of Justice against the anti-abortion provision in Article 40.3.3º of the Irish Constitution following the dismissal of the reference in SPUC <i>v.</i> Grogan on 4 October 1991, the heads of State and Government of the member states meeting in the European Council at Maastricht appended to the treaty on political union the following Protocol.</P>
    <P>The Protocol referred to as Protocol 17, was designed to limit the freedom of women to travel abroad. The Treaty, if passed in its present form, will make this a reality and the so-called &ldquo;Solemn Declaration&rdquo; will make not one whit of difference. The Taoiseach has asked us to accept an assurance that the Government will, if necessary, introduce a further amendment to the Constitution to guarantee the right to travel and freedom of information. But why was that not done in advance of the Maastricht referendum? The deadline for ratification by the member states is the end of this year, and, indeed, that can be extended. The proposed constitutional amendment on travel and information could have been put in advance of the Maastricht referendum if the Taoiseach were serious about reassuring women. Instead, we do not have a wording, never mind legislation.</P>
    <P>Women, in particular, are being asked to sign a blank cheque and to accept the bona fides of the Taoiseach. I do not accept the bona fides of the Taoiseach in this matter and I think that many women share my fears. I am not confident of the willingness of the Taoiseach to stand up to those in his own party who want to turn the clock back and overturn the <Col N="211" /> judgment of the Supreme Court. My lack of confidence was greatly increased by the crude attempts of the Taoiseach to use the threat of resumed injunctions to intimidate women into voting for Maastricht. It is confirmed even more by the pedalling back of the leader of the Progressive Democrats at the weekend. He now seems to have abandoned the assurance he gave that he would not allow within the Coalition Government a proposal for the rolling back of the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties for us all is that different lawyers give different interpretations of the legal position which might follow from various developments. For instance, there are question marks over the continuing validity of Protocol 17 if and when Article 40.3.3º is subsequently amended. One view is that it would continue to protect that Article as long as it is still called Article 40.3.3º; another view is that it protects the Article only as it was at the time the Protocol was agreed, so that any amendment would render it void; another view is that it might perhaps protect Article 40.3.3º as it is when and if the Treaty and Protocols are finally ratified, that is, at the end of this year if all member states say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The most logical position, however, is that the Protocol as it stands can only be read as underwriting Article 40.3.3º as currently interpreted by the Supreme Court, that is allowing travel for purposes of abortion in very limited circumstances but not necessarily permitting travel in other circumstances for example, non-suicidal pregnant women, or availability of abortion information or access to EC law in respect of any other issue which might arise from Article 40.3.3º. Since none of us can predict the range of human and legal issues which might arise in the future in this context, this last point is particularly important. I cannot sum the position up better than to quote the Progressive Democrat MEP, Pat Cox, who just six weeks ago said in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 March last that the Protocol</P>
    <P>...potentially renders Irish women <Col N="212" /> inferior European union citizens compared with men and this is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Nothing has changed since then, except Mr. Pat Cox, who now says we should vote for it, but Democratic Left are not prepared to consent to the relegation of Irish women to a second class status.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the broader issues involved in the Maastricht agreement. The national debate &mdash; in so far as we have had one at all &mdash; has been disappointing, with little real analysis but a lot of sloganeering on both sides. Dire warnings about this country becoming the outcasts of Europe if we fail to ratify, and groundless allegations that conscription of young Irish people into a European army will automatically follow if we do, are no substitute for real debate.</P>
    <P>In many respects it is regrettable that the debate which is now beginning did not take place last year in advance of the Maastricht Summit, when it might have been possible to influence the negotiating position of the Irish Government and secure modifications which could and should have been sought in the Treaty. Unfortunately, the Government did nothing to encourage any real debate at that time and seemed to do everything possible to discourage discussion. Had the Government been more forthcoming, and had there been more political and public scrutiny of their negotiation position, we might have avoided many of the pitfalls and especially the whole Protocol mess.</P>
    <P>The Democratic Left is a pro-Europe party. We are in favour of a democratic European Union, but we are opposed to Maastricht in its current form. There is nothing contradictory in saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Europe but &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Maastricht. That is a democratic choice which the people are faced with at this time. Many trade unionists voted against the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> last year not because they were opposed to the principle of national agreements of this kind but because they believed that it was a bad deal. We hold a similar view of the Maastricht agreement. The <Col N="213" /> position of my party was set out in brief terms in the motion passed at our founding conference in March in the following terms:</P>
    <P>We welcome European Union as a logical and essential development. But our support is based on the absolute requirement of democratic decision making, on economic and social solidarity and rejection of the emergence of a `superpower' or `fortress' mentality in Europe.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks Democratic Left have been engaged in a comprehensive programme of consultation with our members on the Maastricht agreement with a view to ensuring that our members are aware of the provisions of the Treaty and to establish their views on the position we should adopt in the referendum campaign. A discussion document was circulated to all members and meetings were held in most branches and constituencies. It was, I would suggest, the most exhaustive process of consultation and discussion undertaken by any party in this House on the Maastricht agreement.</P>
    <P>The decision of the council of the party at the weekend that we should campaign for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in order to secure renegotiation was not taken lightly. We are well aware of the uncharted waters the Community will be entering if any State fails to ratify it. It was our honest assessment, however, that the benefits of the Treaty as negotiated are outweighed by the political and economic problems which it will create for this country in its present form. We would be failing in our duty to those whom this party represents if we did not point out the shortcomings and inadequacies of Maastricht which have been totally ignored by the other parties.</P>
    <P>We are a pro-Europe party and we will seek to assert a positive influence on the future development of the Community. There is no question of Democratic Left as was implied in the Taoiseach's speech here this evening sharing the crude nationalist, and anti-European views of some of the opponents of Maastricht who <Col N="214" /> want to see Ireland retreat behind some sort of mystical green curtain.</P>
    <P>Our opposition to Maastricht is both from a European and an Irish perspective. As Europeans, we are greatly disappointed at the utter failure of the Treaty to increase democratic accountability in the Community. Although the European Parliament gets some more powers, this in no way balances out the powers which will be transferred from national parliamentary control to the Union over which no democratic control will be exercised. Power will be locked into the Council of Ministers, increasingly influential ministerial groups such as ECOFIN or TREVI, the European Central Bank and the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the motion passed by the European Parliament in relation to Maastricht where it listed more than 20 reservations it had about Maastricht. The European Parliament voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty on the basis that they intended to use it as a basis for developing their position within it. The European Parliament drew attention to major shortcomings in the Treaty which they say:</P>
    <P>(a) Is based on a &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; structure that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;leaves the common foreign and security policy outside the Community Treaty (with, therefore, a lesser role for the Commission and for Parliament and no possibility for legal redress at the Court of Justice);</P>
    <P>&mdash;leaves co-operation in the spheres of justice and home affairs outside the Community Treaty thus escaping effective parliamentary and judicial control in an area in which citizens' rights are directly affected³;</P>
    <P>&mdash;provides for defence matters to be delegated to the Western European Union without providing for appropriate parliamentary control of the activities of this organization.</P>
    <P>(b) fails to provide any economic policy authority with adequate democratic legitimacy to counterbalance the <Col N="215" /> autonomous monetary policy authority of the European Central Bank and lays down specific procedures to economic policy decisions which derogate in Council's favour from traditional Community procedures;</P>
    <P>(c) does not provide a real co-decision procedure, which would have meant that the EP and the Council would have had the same decision-making powers over any legislative act, since the Council is allowed to act unilaterally in the absence of an agreement with the EP, and also applies this procedure only to a limited area;</P>
    <P>(d) fails to provide for parliamentary assent for future Treaty changes, for the modification of own resources or for additional measures concerning citizenship;</P>
    <P>(e) retains procedures requiring unanimity in Council for a very wide range of decision-taking and legislative procedures, including, remarkably, two areas in which the procedure of Article 189b apply, and areas of vital interest to the Community such as many aspects of social and environmental policy and taxation.</P>
    <P>There are many more. It goes on to say that it:</P>
    <P>regrets that European Monetary Union appears to be exclusively geared to stability; while acknowledging the importance of stability, calls for deflationary effects to be prevented when Member States not yet meeting the strict convergence criteria gear their policy to those criteria; calls for the objectives of responsible growth and a high level of employment and social protection to be taken equally seriously, even though there is no provision as yet in the Treaty for specific binding measures in this regard.</P>
    <P>The list goes on about the reservations which the European Parliament has in relation to Maastricht. It cannot be claimed that the European Parliament is dominated by hardline Left forces, such <Col N="216" /> as the Communist Party of France. Neither can it be claimed that the European Parliament is in any way a revolutionary body seeking to isolate the European Community from itself. It is a serious body which I had the honour and the pleasure to serve for a number of years. It is a mistake to simply write off the reservations which serious people have in relation to the way the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated.</P>
    <P>The Committee of the Regions which is being promoted as an advance, and I suppose in the sense that anything is an advance in this area, is likely to be a talking shop and its members who will be appointed on the proposal of national governments, do not even have to be elected representatives. There is nothing to prevent it being used by national governments for purposes of political patronage. The two declarations in the Treaty regarding national parliaments do not go very far and are simply aspirational. Nowhere is there any suggestion as to how national parliaments might exercise greater control over their Council representatives which is where the real &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; of the democratic deficit lies. When in anyone's memory in this House did a Minister come in here to tell the Dáil what was going to be proposed at a Council meeting of Ministers? When did a Minister ever come back to this House and report what decisions had been made and offer the issues for discussion in this House and for guidance here? The Taoiseach of the day will normally come back to this House after an intergovernmental conference and make a statement on what was decided and we would be enabled to make statements in response but there has never been a debate in any real sense on how the European Community is being developed and on what role Ireland is playing. Neither the Opposition parties nor the backbench Deputies of the Government parties have any role or say in this very important area. As a political party in a State on the relatively underdeveloped periphery of the Community facing acute problems of poverty, unemployment and hopelessness, the provisions <Col N="217" /> for economic and social cohesion must form a key part of the Treaty. Any objective assessment of the Treaty in this regard must lead to great disappointment.</P>
    <P>Much has been made by the Taoiseach, and others, of the supposed £6 billion windfall to come Ireland's way if the Treaty is agreed. However, it is now widely acknowledged that there is considerable doubt as to the final value of the fund. Writing in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on Sunday week Paul Tansey, who could not be classified as a revolutionary, a Communist, or someone trying to isolate this country from the European Community, described the fund as &ldquo;enticing bait&rdquo; but warned that it enjoyed only the status of a Commission proposal, contending that it was not a matter of fact. His report continued:</P>
    <P>Decisions on it can be made only by the European Council, not the Commission. The Council will not meet until the end of June, some two weeks after Ireland's scheduled referendum. This means that if Ireland's referendum goes ahead as planned the Irish people will be invited to buy a pig in a poke. They will be asked to vote for European Union without knowing what the returns will be.</P>
    <P>Another article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 26 April quoted a senior United Kingdom Treasury spokesman as saying:</P>
    <P>we do not believe the proposals to increase the EC budget after Maastricht are justified. We disagree with them in principle.</P>
    <P>The same article quoted Norbert Gansel, Foreign Affairs spokesman of the German Social Democratic Party as saying:</P>
    <P>the funding package may be a consequence of the Maastricht Treaty but it is by no means automatic. There are serious misgivings on our side.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should now come clean and admit to the electorate that neither the size of the fund nor Ireland's likely <Col N="218" /> share has been agreed. The strong criticism by the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Hurd, at the meeting of EC Ministers at the weekend, coming on top of reservations expressed by France and Germany, places an even greater question mark over the size of the fund and Ireland's share. What is even more ominous is the final negotiations are likely to take place when Britain, which is taking such a hard line on the fund, will be occupying the EC Presidency.</P>
    <P>Suggestions that the electorate will be voting for or against £6 billion on 18 June are simply untrue. There is no guarantee that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will deliver £6 billion. The Irish Government should have insisted on specific guarantees on the level of funding prior to the signing of the Treaty. It should also be pointed out that there is no question of the European Community shutting off funds entirely to this State as a result of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote. What would be the point of all the rhetoric about European Union, the ideal of a people's Europe, if the response of the eleven member states of the European Community was to be that because 3.5 million people in Ireland, 100th of the population of the European Community, said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and had reservations for a variety of reasons about Maastricht, they would simply cast us into outer darkness? What would be the logic in that? Where would be the commitment to European Union?</P>
    <P>There is a conflict of position in the Taoiseach claiming that the result of a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote would be that we would be cut off almost automatically from the European Community and State Secretary Koehler of the German Finance Ministry in <i>Der Spiegel</i>, in regard to Ireland's recent economic progress, arguing that political solidarity in Western Europe was essential if it was to help the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and that the poorer member countries needed flanking support to reduce differences in development, a process from which all would profit. He strongly defended the Cohesion Fund to protect the environment and promote infrastructural investment, as creating better <Col N="219" /> conditions for private investment. He then cited as a specific example a structurally weak country like Ireland, which had not misused its Structural Funds at others' expense but had brought its budget deficit down dramatically since 1986.</P>
    <P>The two points of view do not hang together. One cannot on the one hand quote the favourable response of German spokespersons to Ireland's performance, then contend that the same people, a month or six weeks later, will cut us off while they financially support countries outside of the European Community in Eastern Europe. It is also non-sensical to argue that if we reject the Maastricht Treaty in a democratic fashion &mdash; which is essentially an amendment of the existing Treaties of Rome and the SEA &mdash; we would be excluded from the European Community in some practical or theoretical way. We are a member of the European Community and we have full rights as a member. The rejection of Maastricht and seeking to renegotiate that Treaty will render the <i>status quo</i> intact. We cannot be excluded from meetings of the Council of Ministers. We cannot be excluded from Inter-governmental Conferences. Where will the exclusion arise unless the Government are determined to exclude themselves, to withdraw, stand in a corner, and fail to promote the interests of our people in the European Community? It is not a logical answer. It is based on an attempt to generate a degree of fear and apprehension among the electorate rather than seeking to argue the positive aspects of the Maastricht Treaty in a mature manner.</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that the Delors II proposals relate to the budget of the European Community, the own resources which the European Community has from VAT income collected from the member states. It is distributed by means of the Structural Funds and Common Agricultural Policy and, as proposed in the Maastricht Treaty, by way of a Cohesion Fund. To assume that a rejection of the Maastricht Treaty would <Col N="220" /> result in the European Community excluding Ireland from any assistance from a budget of the Community is illogical and irrational.</P>
    <P>The Delors package may not result in the amount of money proposed by President Delors being provided. Other speakers have pointed out how inadequate is the EC budget compared with those of other federal unions. The fact is that a budget and resources will be there of at least current proportions. Therefore we will be entitled to fight for the assistance we receive as a full member of the Community.</P>
    <P>However, it must be stressed that the Delors II package is based on a hoped for 2.5 per cent average growth per annum over the five year period to 1997. If that level of growth is not achieved the budget provision will be less, including that for cohesion. Irrespective of the level of growth it is most unlikely that funding will be sufficient to reduce the significant gap which, after 20 years of membership, remains between income levels in Ireland and those at the centre of the Community.</P>
    <P>I was struck by figures the Taoiseach quoted of <i>per capita</i> income, of an increase from 59 per cent to 69 per cent between 1973 and 1992. What struck me as odd was that the normal measurement used in terms of convergence in the European Community is the gross national product per head as an average of the European Community. A BCP Economic Discussion Paper entitled &ldquo;The EC and Ireland &mdash; The Difficult Path to Cohesion&rdquo; stated that:</P>
    <P>In 1992 it is forecast that Ireland will have a GNP per head of 61.4 per cent of the EC average. Back in 1960 we had 62.3 per cent of the EC average. While there was some convergence of the GDP measure this is an inappropriate measure of economic welfare in a country with large capital outflows like Ireland.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The difference between GDP and GNP back in our 1960 base year was <Col N="221" /> that we then had factor flows inwards. GNP was then 2.5 per cent greater than GDP.</P>
    <P>It points out that in 1960 Spain and Ireland had more or less the same living standards, with Ireland at 62.3 per cent of EC GNP per head. Today Spain has moved to 80 per cent while Ireland has fallen to 61.4 per cent. Instead of convergence being developed within Ireland we have fallen back slightly in real terms relative to the other European Community member states. It is not helpful to the debate for the Taoiseach to use selective statistics to try to present an unreal case.</P>
    <P>It is commonly acknowledged that Ireland has not bridged the gap, in relative terms, between our living standards in 1972 and those of today. The Regional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament commissioned a group of independent consultants to carry out a fairly important study which shows that, because of the way they are applied, Structural Funding and, in particular, Common Agricultural Policy funding operate regressively in many respects in Ireland and other peripheral and underdeveloped economies in terms of the overall share of income for the people of the countries or regions concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest disappointments, for Ireland, of the Maastricht Agreement, must be its failure to provide for any common industrial policy to help fight unemployment in this country. Whatever about other areas, the European Community has failed utterly to live up to the promises made that membership would combat unemployment. During the referendum campaign in 1972 we were told that markets in Europe would mean jobs at home. At that stage we had an unemployment level of approximately 70,000. Now our employment level is four times that.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably the most serious shortcomings of the new and old Treaties is that they are intentionally almost totally devoid of employment creation instruments. An industrial policy chapter has been introduced in the Treaty but all <Col N="222" /> the eggs are still in the creation of a deregulated competitive environment basket, still following the eighties dogma that prosperity generates employment. We know to our cost that that is not true. We dispute the argument that intervention to manage industry from a social and regional perspective is incompatible with the notion of efficiency and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The failure to provide for a common industrial policy can only constitute an abandonment of those without jobs &mdash; not just our 300,000, but the 13.5 million officially unemployed throughout the Community. If unemployment levels are ever to be reduced EC intervention is required to ensure that jobs are brought to the people on the periphery and not the other way round.</P>
    <P>As the only Community country which is not a member of NATO and as one which has pursued a policy of military neutrality, the provisions regarding foreign policy and security require particularly careful attention. As Irish citizens and as citizens of Europe we believe that the interests of the peoples of the Community and of the world will be best served by a common foreign and security policy which would be subject to control by democratically accountable institutions, be dedicated to the promotion of peace and without superpower aspirations, operate under the umbrella of the CSCE and be committed to redressing the North-South gap. Judged against these objectives, the Maastricht Treaty fails on all counts. The Maastricht Treaty, in its present form, opens the door to the development of a military dimension to the Community and slams the door on the possibility of the evolution of a non-militarist security policy.</P>
    <P>Maastricht was a lost opportunity for the Community to turn away from seeking to create a new military superpower. Just when the cold war and the system of hostile military blocks had collapsed and become redundant, the peace dividend is being swiped from under the noses of the poor of Europe and the Third World.</P>
    <P>We have a choice to make at this juncture. Maastricht provides for the setting <Col N="223" /> in motion of the development of a militaristic defence policy with maintenance of the existing nuclear arsenal of France and Britain and of political intervention in developing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland must insist that the Community develops a policy which rejects the principle of resolving international conflicts and problems through the use of force. We must continue to point out that the real threat to the security of the EC and the rich world generally lie in the poverty, underdevelopment, lack of democracy, and destruction of the global environment under which most of the world's population lives. We must insist that any transfers of power in the area of foreign and security policy cannot take place until there are democratic institutions in place to control it, and at a minimum that means co-decision-making for the European Parliament with the EC Council.</P>
    <P>For all the reasons I have outlined we are urging a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on 18 June. Our campaign will be vigorous and constructive. We urge all of the electorate to judge the Treaty on its merits and to question the doomsday warnings of the Government in regard to what might happen if there is a no vote on 18 June. If Ireland, or any other country, fails to ratify the Treaty then the EC will continue in its present form until negotiations between the Twelve develop a formula for progress towards a democratic Union, while we in Ireland &mdash; this is most important &mdash; must insist that Irish negotiations are acceptable to the Oireachtas at every stage. This requires far more involvement by this House in the development of the European Community and the role the Irish Government play in the various institutions of the European Community.</P>

      <P>Mar pholaiteoir sa Teach seo a chaith ceithre bliana go leith ag plé le cúrsaí na hEorpa, tá an-áthas orm deis a bheith agam tráthnóna inniu labhairt sa díospóireacht Dála seo faoi Chonradh <Col N="224" /> Aontas na hEorpa. Tá tábhacht bhunúsach ag baint leis an Chonradh do Éirinn, agus mar a dúirt an Taoiseach an tseachtain seo caite agus é ag seoladh an Pháipéir Bháin:</P>
      <P>Our ratification of the Treaty is the most important decision facing us since that in 1972 to join the European Community.</P>
      <P>Ireland stands on the threshold of an exciting and vital stage in our development as a European nation. Maastricht offers the Irish people a unique opportunity to continue to play a leading role in the development of the EC, and to declare ourselves as enthusiastic and wholehearted supporters of the goal of European economic, monetary and political union. The expansion of our trading markets and the development of our economic infrastructure which will follow from Maastricht is of profound importance for the future development of Ireland and our position within the Community.</P>
      <P>These must not be put at risk, something which would happen if Ireland consciously decided to stray away from the mainstream of European development. If we are not at the centre of the EC policy on fundamental issues of vital importance to this country would be determined without Ireland having a seat at the negotiating table. In the economic and monetary area the consequences of Ireland opting out would be disastrous for a small open economy, so heavily dependent on trade, and requiring access to existing and new markets. The weaker Ireland's voice is in Europe in the economic sphere, the more we would have to suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without full membership Ireland would be left to limp along in the shadow of the main economic nations of Europe. There are, of course, dangers associated with this. For example, if Ireland were to come to be regarded as a wavering member of Europe the consequences for foreign investment in this country could be very serious. We already have enough difficulties in the area of economic development associated with our peripheral <Col N="225" /> location in Europe without excluding ourselves from the enhanced opportunities for open trade associated with Maastricht.</P>
    <P>In more general ways, the isolation of Ireland which would follow on rejection of the Maastricht Treaty would also affect the political, social and cultural growth in our country. The development of Ireland and our ability to play a major and equal part in the development of European unity in the future can only be ensured through full membership. In a nutshell, we must ensure that we are not only at the heart of Europe, but that our hearts are there too.</P>
    <P>When the Channel tunnel opens next year, Ireland will be the only EC member state without a land link to mainland Europe. As Europe's most peripheral member state, Ireland has unique transport needs which can only be met with the help of significant levels of EC assistance. The EC is committed to providing such assistance to ensure that the peripheral regions are better linked to Central Europe and to ensure that transport improvements are widely spread throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme on Peripherality agreed between the Government and the EC Commission provides the framework for assistance from the EC Structural Funds in respect of transport investment in the period 1989-93. Total expenditure under the programme on roads and other transport infrastructure will be £865 million and the EC will contribute £555 million of this. The bulk of the expenditure has been earmarked to improve Irish roads, but the programme will also include major investments in airport, port and public transport infrastructure.</P>
    <P>My Department's allocation of funding amounts to £140 million with the EC contributing about £75 million of this investment in public transport. Under the programme, investment in public transport of up to £30 million is planned, of which the EC are providing almost £20 million. More specifically, approval has recently been secured for investment in the Dublin-Belfast railway line. The project <Col N="226" /> will involve investment of £73 million. It will be completed within five years and 75 per cent of the investment cost is being funded by the EC. This project is of major significance and importance in the context of developing closer North-South economic co-operation as part of the wider process of improving economic, political, and social contracts between both parts of Ireland. These links will assume even greater importance in the context of the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>There is also a huge need for major investment in a modern public transport system for Dublin, with the upgrading of the mainline rail system also being mentioned as another priority. Such investments could not possibly be undertaken without major financial support from the EC, including assistance under the increased Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund which will flow from Maastricht.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Dublin transportation initiative, which will present an interim report in the autumn of this year, will contain radical and innovative proposals to resolve Dublin's traffic congestion problems. These are now very severe and are making it almost impossible to provide effective and efficient public transport services. One potential solution being advocated is the development of a city-wide light rail mass transit system as a possible way of solving the traffic congestion problems in Dublin. Such a solution is clearly very attractive and would give Dublin a modern public transport system comparable to those which are operating in many European cities of similar size.</P>
    <P>The massive investment which would be required to support such a development is clearly beyond the capacity of the Irish Exchequer either at present or for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The quality of service on our mainline rail network has come in for considerable criticism in recent times. The problems are largely related to the age and condition of the track, signalling and rolling stock, all of which now require significant levels of investment. A major strategic <Col N="227" /> review of the future investment needs of the mainline rail network is currently being undertaken by CIE in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Finance. This study is examining all the major issues, including the options for the future of the railway network and the costs, investment requirements and funding possibilities in relation to all these options. The results of the strategic study will form an integral element in the formulation of an investment programme for the railways.</P>
    <P>The levels of State support for the railways over the years has been very significant. Between 1980 and 1991 total direct State support to the railways was more than £940 million. In addition, capital investment of almost £230 million was made by CIE over the same period. In the current year, the State subvention to CIE will amount to £108 million, of which approximately £90 million will be allocated to the railways. With State funding for the railways already at a high level, it will clearly be difficult for the Exchequer to provide significant additional resources to support the large investment now required. I intend, therefore, to pursue the possibilities of EC assistance from the Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund for a railway investment programme. I am determined to ensure that public transport receives a significantly greater share of EC funds for investment than in the past.</P>
    <P>Ireland has welcomed the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty concerning the development of trans-European networks in the areas of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructure. Investment in these networks, together with improved access to them, is of special importance to peripheral regions like Ireland. This is particularly important in the case of transport networks when it is realised that improving access to and from Ireland often depends on transport systems in other countries and on the willingness of their Governments to invest in transit routes.</P>
    <P>Improved access to the European <Col N="228" /> transport networks is a vital factor in promoting the economic development of Ireland. I would like to again take this opportunity to emphasise that the Irish Government's priority is to improve and invest in transport links with Europe on the basis of maximum assistance from Community financial instruments.</P>
    <P>Ireland has participated actively in the recent detailed discussions at Community level relating to the development of combined transport and high speed rail networks. We will continue to take a special interest in these areas, following on Maastricht, and in the developments associated with the Cohesion Fund. On a general level, the Irish authorities believe that projects to be assisted under the Cohesion Fund should not be confined or limited to those which have been identified in the course of the work on combined transport and high speed rail. Flexibility is essential if member states like Ireland are to be in a position to productivity absorb the resources becoming available under Cohesion for development purposes.</P>
    <P>Strategy for the development of trans-European networks must also acknowledge that in the case of peripheral regions like Ireland, with no land connections to mainland Europe, maritime and shipping links should figure as an inherent element in the development of the community's networks. In Ireland's case such links require major Community investment in the central and southern sea corridors on the Irish Sea. Already the EC has acknowledged this requirement in the study of &ldquo;Europe 2000&rdquo;&mdash; it noted that problems of peripherality are often exacerbated by the existence of natural barriers, such as sea and mountain ranges. Accordingly, the Commission accepted that the existence of such factors increases the costs of linking the periphery to the rest of the Community, to the disadvantage of Ireland and Greece, in particular.</P>
    <P>I recognise, however, that European transport networks must, of course, be developed in response to the demands of the market and having regard to the resources that are available. In framing <Col N="229" /> the overall strategy, the difficulties and different characteristics and requirements of the peripheral countries must also continuously be addressed.</P>
    <P>The implications of the Maastricht Treaty, and in particular the provisions concerning trans-European networks, economic and social cohesion and the establishment of a Cohesion Fund are now being assessed in detail by the Irish administration.</P>
    <P>Under the current peripherality programme, development works at Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports are also being assisted by the EC to the extent of almost £40 million, at a total cost of £79 million. I recognise that EC assistance for improvements at the airports beyond 1993 will be crucial. Passenger traffic at Dublin Airport reached 5.4 million in 1990 and put a very severe strain on the capacity of the terminal building. Traffic at the airport fell by 4 per cent in 1991, owing to the effects of the Gulf War and the international recessions in the USA and UK. However, traffic at Dublin Airport to date in 1992 has shown renewed buoyancy, up by 6 per cent on the same period in 1991.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta estimate that if growth continues, a new passenger terminal will be necessary at the airport early in the next century, and have asked Dublin County Council to make provision for this in their county development plan. This will be a major project, costing upwards of £150 million and generating several hundred new jobs during construction. It is a project for which we will be looking for considerable financial support from the EC. We will also be looking for EC support for further improvements at Shannon and Cork airports.</P>
    <P>The current network of regional airports &mdash; Waterford, Farranfore, Galway, Connaught, Sligo and Carrickfin &mdash; is of fundamental importance in facilitating balanced regional growth and meeting the tourism and transport needs of our most peripheral regions. These airports provide access to some of the country's best tourism products.</P>
    <P>A European Regional Development Fund assisted development programme <Col N="230" /> is under way at the regional airports. When this programme is completed at the end of 1993, the regional airports will have the capacity to handle significant increases in passenger volumes. Like the State airports, the regional airports were adversely affected in 1991 by the Gulf War and by the recession in the USA and UK. Passenger traffic fell by an average of 23 per cent for the six airports in 1991 compared with 1990. To date in 1992, there are some indications of renewed growth.</P>
    <P>When the present European Regional Development Fund assisted programme at the regional airports is completed, two of them will be able to handle jet aircraft &mdash; Farranfore and Connaught. Jet capability could well be necessary at some of the other regional airports in the light of traffic growth in the next few years, costing up to £30 million. These projects, if they prove necessary in the light of traffic increases, will be put forward for assistance from the EC.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the tourism sector. The Government see the tourism industry as a major contributor to economic development in Ireland in the future. Over the past three years, EC Structural Funds have played a crucial role in securing a dramatic increase of up to 45 per cent in foreign tourism earnings. In 1991 tourism earnings stood at £1.2 billion. In the three year period up to the end of 1990 the tourism sector has helped to create over 16,000 additional jobs in the Irish economy. Tourism now accounts for one in 14 of all jobs in the economy or one in every eight in the services.</P>
    <P>The major developments now under way aimed at improving our tourism product range are largely attributable to the funds being made available to Ireland under the EC Operational Programme for Tourism. Under this programme, which runs until the end of 1993, the European Community will invest more than £130 million from the European Regional Development Fund and over £30 million from the European Social Fund in the development of Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> This investment funding is being directed at product development, marketing and training. In the product area investment is spread over a wide range of amenities and facilities including walking-cycling trails, cruising, equestrian centres, and in world class facilities for golf, indoor leisure, water, field and adventure sports, conferences and language and craft learning.</P>
    <P>This EC investment is serving to lever large amounts of public and private investment into tourism development in Ireland. So far, over 300 projects have been approved for assistance under the Operational Programme for Tourism, involving a total investment cost of about £300 million. The EC contribution to this amount is almost £100 million.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1993, it is expected that EC investment in Irish tourism will amount to more than £200 million when account is taken of all EC programmes associated with tourism development in Ireland. This EC funding has been instrumental in generating up to £1 billion of new tourism investment over the period into one of the best performing sectors of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Maastricht Treaty will ensure that the Irish tourism sector continues to have access to this considerable source of assistance and will help towards further growth in the sector which now represents almost 7 per cent of gross national product.</P>
    <P>In addition to networks in the transport and energy fields trans-European networks are being developed in the area of telecommunications. These will essentially be in the fields of integrated services digital networks (ISDN), broadband communications and data networks.</P>
    <P>The Community is required, under Article 130A of the Maastricht Treaty, to develop and pursue its actions leading to economic and social cohesion and in particular to aim at reducing the disparities between the levels of development of the various regions. In order to achieve these objectives in the field of telecommunications Article 129b requires the Community to contribute to <Col N="232" /> the establishment and development of such networks and to take particular account of the need to link island, land-locked and peripheral regions with the central regions of the Community. Action by the Community will aim at promoting the interconnection and inter-operability of national networks as well as access to such networks. The Commission may support projects of common interest through feasibility studies, loan guarantees or interest rate subsidies.</P>
    <P>The establishment of these networks at a time when ordinary commercial requirements might not justify them will be extremely expensive and the financial assistance which may be provided under the Maastricht Treaty will facilitate the establishment in Ireland of such networks. Our linkages to trans-European telecommunications networks is another area which would suffer financially if the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty are not implemented.</P>
    <P>Failure to ratify the Maastricht Treaty would put the funds and development plans that are so crucial to Ireland's development in jeopardy. This would have the most serious consequences for the Government's overall plans for development of the tourism, transport and telecommunications sectors in the economy. Many of our public expenditure programmes would have to be severely curtailed in the absence of EC funding.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty is an important practical step in making the European Community more relevant to its people and in promoting a sense of shared European identity. Ireland's interests and our people's welfare are best served by wholehearted and active participation in the move forward towards European Union. What the National Economic and Social Council pointed out in 1974 is equally true today &mdash;&ldquo;it is not possible to stop the world and let Ireland off&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, I have no hesitation in calling for a clear and decisive &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June. I am very hopeful and positive about Ireland's prospects. We must vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the Maastricht <Col N="233" /> Referendum to ensure that we can prosper through our continued full participation in Europe.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Maastricht Treaty and to speak on the Referendum to be held on 18 June 1992. I am annoyed by the Government's approach to this very important fundamental issue involving one of the most important decisions our people will have had to face since the foundation of the State. What should be a wholehearted response to the Treaty by a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote has been turned into turmoil by the Government's inability to approach the matter correctly. The right to travel and to information should be resolved before the holding of a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. The Government, however, have come in here every morning with their trousers on back to front and are running the country in the same manner. That is outrageous at a time of such serious developments in our country.</P>

      <P>In this House the Taoiseach threatened the women of Ireland that if they did not vote in a certain fashion it was woe betide them as he would unleash all the powers of the law on them. Such a statement is outrageous. It is an insult to women and should never have been uttered. The Taoiseach owes them an apology.</P>
      <P>I have stated my reservations and those of my party but I am fully in favour of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June. The alternative is unthinkable. The benefits to be reaped from showing we are fully committed to Europe are there to be taken but we will not reap them if we do not have people of ability to negotiate on our behalf. We have been sadly lacking in this respect over the years. We have not to date reaped the benefits of membership of the EC. We are missing out in many areas of opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I attended a regional conference <Col N="234" /> addressed by the EC Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, a former Minister for Agriculture and for Finance. This well attended meeting drew people from as far apart as Clare and Donegal &mdash; local authority representatives, farm and rural organisations representatives, farmers and their wives. People were worried about what the future held for them. The presidents of the IFA and the ICMSA also addressed the meeting, but their message was far from bright. The Commissioner made an excellent address and I congratulate him on his straightforward speech. People need to understand clearly the direction in which they are going and what the future holds for them. This is vitally important, more so in rural Ireland than elsewhere in the country. The Commissioner made the point that the LEADER programme, and other EC programmes, should not be seen as a substitute for agri-activities but as a supplement to agricultural development. I am annoyed at the Government's decision to buy up the 10 million gallon milk quota and remove it from an area in a line north east-north west from Galway to Dublin to the south of Ireland with a consequent loss of £8 million to the economy of the region I represent. This is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn speak about cohesion at EC level but I think we should talk about cohesion at national level. The Minister made many fine points in her address. She dwelt at length on the transport problems in Dublin city and the need for a rail link system but she did not make any reference to the question of county roads. These roads are in such bad condition that people cannot get from their homes to their place of worship; their children cannot go to school and farmers cannot get their products, which they produce in such quantity and quality, to the processors. We talk about cohesion. Let us have cohesion at national level and distribute the wealth from the EC and the wealth we generate nationally to <Col N="235" /> rural Ireland. The Minister talked about tourism being concentrated in the areas of large population.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Mental Treatment (Amendment) Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I said the objectives of this Bill were admirable. Many other speakers echoed the same sentiment. It is difficult to comprehend the horror and turmoil of wrongful incarceration. Wrongful detention in a mental institution must be akin to some Kafkaesque nightmare.</P>
      <P>I have complimented Deputy Fennell for highlighting this particular issue. It is timely, as we have seen from a couple of recent extraordinary cases, that the issue be discussed, brought out of the shade and highlighted politically. The Bill has made progress in that it has achieved that purpose. I said also that while I believe the Bill will not go beyond Second Stage the considerable purpose will have been served in that the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Connell, has already given a clear indication that it is his intention to provide in the Green Paper for this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of my contribution last week I mentioned, too, that I felt that the subject matter of this Bill was so complex and so multifaceted that it was not appropriate legislation to cover in Private Members' time. I mentioned that legislation in this area should cover many areas which, through no fault of the drafter, are not covered in this Bill. Clearly, it must cover responsibility for services, deal with the issue of designation of centres for the provision of the services, deal with the issue of licensing and the control provisions, guardianship, protection against exploitation &mdash; particularly exploitation when we <Col N="236" /> move into a community care mode &mdash; the issue of advocacy and the establishment of mechanisms to vindicate rights. It strikes me that these can only be addressed in legislation produced by the Minister for Health, with the benefit of all the professional services that a serving Minister has, and also following the production of a Green Paper which the Minister has indicated he intends to produce.</P>
    <P>The matter of admission to hospital or a psychiatric centre needs to be given far greater consideration in law than is provided for in the proposed Bill. The Bill does not, for example, address the matter of voluntary admission and its replacement by informal admission. Clearly, any new legislation must incorporate a change whereby patients can enter psychiatric services, hospitals or centres with no formality other than what currently exists in the general hospital.</P>
    <P>As the time is short I will abbreviate some of my comments. It is clear also that the whole time element needs to be dealt with in greater details. It is important that new legislation should provide for a much shorter period for detention than the six months currently in vogue. Furthermore, any new legislation should contain within it a review period; I suggest a review period of a week and certainly not more than a month on any detention order before allowing it to become effective.</P>
    <P>The reality is we are dealing with an extraordinarily complex area, an area that is tragically difficult to deal with it in Private Members' time. A Bill on this issue should concern itself, in greater detail than this Bill does, with the whole issue of consent for treatment. A matter of compulsory treatment for people deemed to be seriously ill and in need of such treatment but who refuse to have such treatment, will have to be the subject of review and detailed consideration. The Bill does not take cognisance of a wide range of issues which must be the subject of any proposed new legislation. These issues would reflect the considerable progress which has been made. While there are dark areas in mental <Col N="237" /> treatment it is important to recognise that considerable progress has been made during the past few years.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset of my contribution the previous day that I was pleased to be able to deal, however briefly, with this extraordinarily complex area. I said also that I have the utmost confidence in the Minister for Health who has indicated the prerequisites for resolving the difficulties. He has indicated, first, that he is conscious of the problem and, second, that he has the compassion needed to resolve it. From what we know of his character he has the will to resolve the problem. While I compliment Deputy Fennell for introducing the Bill, I am confident that we can reposit our confidence in the Minister on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Fine Gael for the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate and, in particular, Deputy Nuala Fennell for taking the initiative to draw attention to an appalling and glaring absence in the whole area of law reform, a situation that was highlighted by the unfortunate case of the woman who had been taken almost summarily into the custody of one of our mental hospitals but who was, at least, able to make contact with the outside world, convince people of her sanity and, through Deputy Fennell and others, highlight the utter inadequacies of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, as a vehicle of protecting and ensuring the rights of people who are alleged by others to be somewhat mentally deficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, is the most outdated item of legislation relating to the general area of civil liberties and medicine in Ireland today. It is particularly significant, despite the many developments that have taken place in both the legal and medical areas, that our legislation in this area has fallen so far and so notably behind. The draconian nature of the 1945 Act is based on the idea that those with mental deficiency or handicap are considered less than human by the great majority of us. The deference paid on the other hand to the unquestioning judgment of members of <Col N="238" /> the medical profession adds to the unsatisfactory nature of the provisions in the 1945 Act that have existed for far too long. These ideas were graphically brought home to me as a practising solicitor in the early seventies. One of my first cases involved &mdash; I hope the House will bear with me while I explain it &mdash; a man from the west who was lodged in the central mental hospital in Dundrum. He wrote to me and I went to see him. He explained that because of a marital disagreement between himself and his wife she had literally got to the local priest and doctor quicker than he had &mdash; not that he ever suggested he would take that avenue &mdash; and by one device or another he ended up in a district mental hospital.</P>
    <P>There, protesting to the resident medical superintendent his innocence and sanity, he was simply ignored and spurned. As the resident medical superintendent turned on his heel to walk away, this patient picked up a stone, threw it in his direction and missed. Nonetheless he was charged with the offence of common assault, was certified by the district justice within the terms of the Act, and on a certificate of the Minister for Justice of the day, ended up in Dundrum Central Mental Hospital. That was in 1953. In 1975, 22 years later, I met that man, sane as the day he went in but, unfortunately, at that stage very institutionalised. The doctors' concern was not with regard to the man's sanity but rather with his inability to cope with the outside world should someone take the courage and the decision to discharge him. Shortly afterwards, as a result of a lawyer now showing some consideration, the case was reviewed and, within a short time, he was returned to the district mental hospital and, eventually, released into the commmunity. In the early days of his committal he challenged the whole process in the High Court, but the law of the day in reviewing it through a process of judicial review <i>certiorari</i> was that the strict letter of the law had been complied with. For upwards of 22 years a sane, inoffensive man was detained unnecessarily at Dundrum Central Mental <Col N="239" /> Hospital, and only because of the provisions of the 1945 Act.</P>
    <P>Shortly after, as a knock-on effect, another unfortunate man wrote to me from Dundrum Central Mental Hospital. This man, spurred by the success of his co-patient, had written to the High Court to complain that after 15 years something should be done about the fact that as a sane person he was still incarcerated in Dundrum Central Mental Hospital. This man, again, was sane and inoffensive. He was eccentric, certainly, and a person of very determined and emphatic view. The case was lost in the High Court but, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the then Chief Justice recognised that while the letter of the law had been complied with, the assertions of the man, so carefully set out in documentary evidence and almost screaming his sanity, opened up the possibility that a person, though technically and legally correctly lodged, could nonetheless challenge the medical view and use the courts as a device to do that. Again, the Supreme Court asked if I would act on his behalf. I did so temporarily but, as part of his eccentricity, he decided he would do better in the Supreme Court arguing his case without my services. Subsequently, on my election to the Dáil in 1987, I was extremely pleased to be called to the gate of Leinster House to meet this man. Though he had failed in his legal arguments in the Supreme Court, he was subsequently transferred back to the district mental hospital and released back into the community because of the initiatives he had taken. He also was as sane and inoffensive though perhaps as eccentric as the day he went in.</P>
    <P>These two cases brought home to me that people who have been plucked from our community and lodged in a mental hospital on the certification of one or two doctors are in the worst possible position to launch a case on their behalf. It is remarkable that so little has been done over the years to review the operation of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945. There are many provisions in that Act which are totally inconsistent with our constitutional <Col N="240" /> thinking and with medical opinion and practice today. It is because the people concerned are in our mental institutions and are so little regarded that so little has been done.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable achievement by Deputy Fennell and those who have been drawn into a broad group, to have produced legislation, however limited in the way it is expected to act, designed to challenge the 1945 Act, how it has worked since it was introduced, and highlight the need for action. To the extent that that is the purpose of the Bill, I am happy, on behalf of the Democratic Left, to support it. I committed that support in writing to Deputy Fennell on receipt of the Bill. As a mechanism to force us to address legislation that is long out of date and in need of reform, this initiative by Deputy Fennell and Fine Gael deserves the support of the House. One has to accept that this Bill may be defeated if the Government take an absolute position against it on the vote, but if the Minister for Health will give a commitment, if he has not done so, to take direct action on the issues raised it will be a good thing.</P>
    <P>There was reference to a Green Paper or, perhaps, a White Paper on the issues. I am concerned about that because I have argued the need to bring forward a verdicts Bill to deal with insanity as an issue in the criminal justice area. If that is to be deferred to await this paper, we will have to wait longer than we expected for the legislation promised by various Ministers. Whatever about the desirability of having a major paper on this area of work, there are too many cases in which the Mental Treatments Act, 1945 is being abused in a way that we never intended. If we are not to take on board this legislation and await longer process of report and debate then the Minister must give a commitment to take decisive interim action employing whatever provisions in the 1945 legislation as are available to him. In particular the Minister should agree that the inspector of mental hospitals be given adequate resources and a directive to carry out an overview <Col N="241" /> of all patients now in the Central Mental Hospital and in district mental hospitals that are a cause for concern.</P>
    <P>The legislation is particularly welcome and must be fully considered. It presents an opportunity that must not be missed. The constituency of the mentally handicapped or deficient, of the people who are in our mental hospitals, is so marginalised that it is rarely a Deputy, particularly from the Opposition, has the opportunity to bring forward reforming legislation on their behalf. It is almost akin to the position of aliens in Ireland who are so poorly treated by Government and administrative officers. Again, the prospect of ever developing any movement within this House to bring forward legislation to establish a proper administration procedure for dealing with aliens coming to these shores is so unlikely because they are such a marginalised constituency. The same applies to the mentally handicapped and for that reason I would be slow to allow this legislation to slip lightly away from this Chamber on the basis that the issue will be looked at in due course by Government. It needs a more specific and stronger commitment than that.</P>
    <P>The legislation is brought forward to deal specifically with two phenomena. The first is the use of the Act as a device to take people into custody in extraordinary circumstances and in circumstances never contemplated by the Act. Those are the type of short term actions taken in classic family rows or marital disputes where the certificate of a doctor &mdash; or doctors &mdash; is required for the purpose of committing someone to a psychiatric hospital.</P>
    <P>The first point I want to make refers to a more general matter, the very curious provisions of the 1945 Act, which say that if the patient is being taken to a private hospital there is a need for two doctors to sign the commital form but that if the patient is being taken to a public hospital, only one doctor need sign. The very clear discriminatory provision in that Act is based on the fact that a private hospital will be receiving well off &ldquo;private&rdquo; patients and that public hospitals are for the poor. It is a remarkable class discrimination <Col N="242" /> written into the 1945 legislation which has survived for so long, despite our Constitution and its provisions.</P>
    <P>It is an invidious discrimination which, in any amending legislation, should be addressed; Deputy Fennell proposes to do that in her legislation as, from now on, two doctors will be needed to sign the form. However, I do not believe that in her legislation there is a requirement that at least one of the doctors should be someone employed or appointed by the Minister of the day with specific expertise to assess these types of cases, as provided for in the 1983 legislation in England. It is something which should be addressed so that one doctor is not supporting another colleague at the same level or in the same discipline or practice. It is very important to have one perhaps from the community in general practice and the other a doctor with psychiatric or specific training and expertise who can professionally assess the correctness of the procedure.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposals in the Bill dealing with the abuse of the situation which exists &mdash; which is all too common and continues to this day &mdash; of using the 1945 Act as a device to resolve interfamily disputes or marital problems, the first phenomenon I mentioned, the legislation proposed by Deputy Fennell, argues for the setting up of a review board. There is a fundamental difference between the process of reviewing and the process of appealing against a decision. In a review you are simply asking a higher authority to survey what has gone before and to decide whether it was correctly dealt with on the facts available to the original people who made the decision. However, in an appeal process, you are moving to a higher authority and you are entitled to look for an entirely new decision based on additional or new evidence and on an entirely new process or hearing.</P>
    <P>In any legislation dealing with this issue I would much prefer to see a process of appeal in place as opposed to a process of review. In fact, some of the later provisions in the Bill circulated by Deputy <Col N="243" /> Fennell seem to suggest that, while she is legislating for a process of appeal, she calls it a process of review. That is particularly suggested by the provisions in section 6 which entitle the review board to make separate types of orders from those originally given, to release a person where they are not happy with his or her commital and to allow for the hearing &mdash; orally or otherwise &mdash; of the review process. The importance of an appeal is that a person is entitled to be present, to be represented, to call additional evidence and witnesses and to be heard on his or her own behalf. That is not the established law in a process of review but it could be dealt with on Committee Stage of the Bill and rectified. It is really only a matter of terminology in the Bill, as opposed to anything in principle, which would divide Deputy Fennell and myself.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the period of time provided for by way of review. If the legislation is specifically seeking to provide a vehicle for tackling the kind of situation which led to Deputy Fennell outlining the case of the unfortunate woman, which was so well documented in the media and in this House on the Adjournment and in other debates, a period of one month is extremely long to enable action to be taken by the review board. I would have thought that a person complaining that he or she had been summarily taken from home, workplace or other area and committed to a mental hospital and who was protesting his or her sanity should be entitled to be heard within a matter of days &mdash; if not hours &mdash; rather than the period of one month provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Certainly different considerations arise with the second phenomenon, that of the longer stay patient who has been in a district mental hospital for over one year or thereabouts where the Bill argues for a systematic review of all these cases. In that case a period of one month would seem to be reasonable but I suggest to Deputy Fennell that she should shorten the period provided for in her Bill. I do not think there could be any objections if the principle and idea is that we should <Col N="244" /> not tolerate the abuse of this type of legislation to take people unwarrantedly and summarily into custody on medical grounds. They should be entitled to an immediate review or appeal.</P>
    <P>Because of the quasi-judicial nature of the process suggested, there is also a need to reaffirm in this or any legislation that it is not a substitute for the provisions of <i>habeas corpus</i> which exist in the broader law. There is also &mdash; and should always be &mdash; the right of a litigant to go directly to the courts if he or she decides to do so. There may be occasions when it is much more appropriate to get the sanction and protection of the court rather than simply relying on an internal review procedure. That is something which should be provided for. I say that not just simply as a throwaway consideration; there is a body of law developing on the administrative, natural justice side within our courts which says that if there is an avenue of redress administratively within the authority, a hospital, school, university or union, the courts tend to deny the review procedures of the courts in favour of exhausting the internal remedies first. However, <i>habeas corpus</i> is a very important right and should always be available to a patient or a person in custody in addition to or over and above any administrative internal arrangements.</P>
    <P>Because of the vulnerability of the people in hospital, we should also provide in any legislation for the establishment of duty solicitor schemes in relation to each of the hospitals. This can be very easily provided for and established in consultation with district Bar associations and district associations of the solicitors' profession. In every county or region in which there is a district mental hospital there is a readiness by solicitors to work on a duty rota system, in consultation with the Department of Health, to provide an immediate panel of lawyers who can be contacted on behalf of a patient to say that he or she requires legal advice and assistance and to ask for a lawyer. Mental hospitals have very high walls and are terribly remote <Col N="245" /> places. Unfortunately, communications from them tend to be ignored or put aside on the basis that they are from people who are less than human things. That is why a duty solicitor scheme is very important, it should be established if not legislated for.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions in the Bill argues that non-family persons who seek a review can only do so at the discretion of the review board. I suggest that a rider be attached to the effect that the discretion only be exercised for good cause. Perhaps the discretion should be taken away entirely. A person can be wrongly committed following internal family rows. The person committed might not have within the immediate family someone who would come to his or her aid. It is important that there should be an outside person, a friend perhaps, who should not have to show good cause and who would have the same rights to come in as a family member.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the board would not be entitled to release a person unless satisfied that the person would not be a danger to his self-interest or a danger to the community. This is very close to the provision in the British legislation. If a person is wrongly lodged in the first place, he or she should be entitled to be released provided that the review board consider him or her mentally fit. The fact that the person concerned might on release assault the person responsible for having him sent in is not a matter that should be borne in mind. A person could have a huge grudge against a spouse or other family member perceived as having been responsible for having him or her put into hospital in the first place and it would be a matter for the criminal code to deal with any such assault. If a person is of sound mind, that should be the only criterion with regard to release.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions dealing with people who are detained unnecessarily for inordinately long periods. It is important that there be a systematic review by an independent body. Under the 1945 Act that work is supposed to be ongoing by the Minister for Health through the inspector of hospitals. From my experience <Col N="246" /> of visiting mental hospitals, patients are not aware of that. They are totally at sea, not knowing that there is an authority looking after them and taking an interest in them.</P>
    <P>The legislation is a valiant effort to highlight an area of major oversight by our legislators. That oversight is rooted directly in the problem of peripherality and isolation which is the constituency of mental hospital inhabitants. A very good opportunity is presented by this Bill. The 1945 Act is grossly outdated in many of its concepts and ideas. It is incumbent on us as a matter of urgency to legislate in this area. For those reasons my party will support this Bill on Second Stage and we commend Deputy Fennell on her initiative.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Fennell on bringing forward her Bill. It is very timely because it gives the House an opportunity to discuss the 1945 Mental Health Act. The input to the debate will be useful to the Minister in his onerous responsibilities in the coming months.</P>
      <P>We all accept that the 1945 Act is outdated in terms of dealing with the admission of persons against their wishes. The case Deputy McCartan first instanced would suggest that in his opinion it was outdated in 1953, within eight years of its passage through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that there should be a legal framework for the development of community psychiatry, which did not exist to any great extent in 1945. We would all have to be very concerned at the wrongful detention of any person in a psychiatric hospital or elsewhere and the purpose of this Bill is to deal with that. It is also important to keep a balance. We do not want to frighten people outside who find themselves in need of psychiatric treatment in a hospital. We must not give the impression that something is very <Col N="247" /> seriously wrong there and that their rights will not be attended to. In my experience as a medical practitioner and in the Department of Health the number of complaints about admission was small.</P>
    <P>Consultants in the psychiatric hospitals have very rarely seen people admitted who did not need admission. It is important to recognise that of the people who go into a psychiatric hospital, 80 per cent do so voluntarily. Of those who go into hospital involuntarily, 80 per cent are out within six months. The number of people going into hospital for longer than six months is very small. In St. Davnet's, a major psychiatric hospital in the Cavan-Monaghan area, ten patients were admitted for longer than six months in 1991. It is expected that at least two thirds of those will be back living in the community within two years. Nowadays there is nothing like the position which obtained some years ago when patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals might spend the rest of their lifetime there.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned that there should ever be a wrongful admission or a wrongful detention. There is a major responsibility on everybody concerned in the admission of a patient to a hospital against his or her wishes. There is a major responsibility on the applicant, on the general practitioner who makes the recommendation and on the consultant at the psychiatric hospital. If a medical practictioner were wilfully to sign a recommendation and a reception order against the interests of the patient, that would bring on the doctor the wrath of the Medical Council and probably erasure from the medical register.</P>
    <P>It surprised me that Deputy Fennell when dealing with admission to hospital dealt only with the recommendation. This legislation would require that two doctors should sign the recommendation, but there is no reference to the person signing the application. Deputy Fennell cited the case of a husband who signed an application to have his wife committed to hospital a week after she had secured a barring order against him. The fault in that instance lay with the applicant. The <Col N="248" /> reform of legislation in this area should begin with the application. Perhaps an applicant should declare any issue that might bring undue influence, that might be a source of undue influence or be perceived to put undue influence on the decision to be made.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether two applicants rather than two general practitioners should be required to sign an application for involuntary admission into a psychiatric hospital, it seems to me that whether the signatures of one or two general practitioners should be required is not particularly at issue. Deputy McCartan and Deputy Fennell have pointed to a wide variation in what happens in major urban areas as compared with rural areas. In rural areas it is generally the family doctor who would sign the recommendation for admission and the family doctor, or any other doctor from the area who might be standing in for him or her and would know the people concerned and their background. The kind of occurrences described by Deputy Fennell and Deputy McCartan would as a result be highly unlikely to arise in rural areas. The Minister might therefore consider the question of applications, the way in which they are signed and whether there are any factors that might bring undue influence or might be perceived as constituting undue influence on the part of the person making the application. A reception order is signed by a consultant psychiatrist, who has seven days in which to sign such an order. That time might be shortened. A case might be made for the issue of a reception order as soon as a patient arrives at a psychiatric hospital, which order would be valid for only 72 hours, when it would be reviewed by the psychiatrist, who would issue a further order if that were considered necessary.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of major concern to each and every one of us that no one should be wrongfully detained in a psychiatric hospital. At the same time, it is important that there be procedures in place whereby a person who does need to be detained in a psychiatric hospital, either in the interests of protecting themselves <Col N="249" /> or in the interests of protecting other members of the public, might receive the necessary care effectively and expeditiously. Of course we have to be careful that we do not create an environment in which people could be admitted or detained wrongfully in a psychiatric hospital but it is important to keep a balance. Society expects that. We would not be thanked if we were to bring forward legislation that would prevent persons who were a danger either to themselves or to others from being detained in an involuntary way if that was necessary.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made last week by the Minister and the Minister of State in relation to mental health review boards. It is desirable to have mental health review boards in place but it is important to carefully examine the kind of review board to be put in place. Under Deputy Fennell's Bill a review board would consider the position of a patient only on the application of a relative. I believe that the provision should be much broader that anybody would have access to a review board and that all patients should be reviewed from time to time. We have to conform with the European Convention and with United Nations regulations. Legislation adopted should also specify who would be involved in a review board. I consider that a review board should constitute a psychiatrist, perhaps a legal person and a lay person. In time, the review board would review all patients. Deputy Fennell's Bill would result in a review being made only on the application of a relative but that would not conform with one of our obligations under the European Convention. We must guard against introducing legislation that would prove to be unsatisfactory and therefore never be implemented, as happened in 1981.</P>
    <P>Section 9 places an obligation on the senior psychiatrist in a hospital to provide the patient with all of the documents when an order is made. While I agree that the principle of this provision is desirable, such a measure would not work. First, the psychiatrist would need to take account of the patient's mental capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> At the time of such an order being signed, many patients would not be in a position to understand what was happening. In my view, it is not practical to implement legislation that would provide that on the signing of a reception order patients had to receive into their hands documents relating to their admission to and detention in a hospital. Another point worth mentioning is that if all of the documentation were to be handed to patients as soon as they went into hospital, people outside might be deterred from making an application. None of us wants an application made that might wrongfully detain a person &mdash; and, as I have said, that is a very rare occurrence &mdash; but at the same time we do not want a situation to develop in which relatives in particular will not sign an application in the instance of a person needing to be admitted to hospital because they are afraid of the paper being handed to the patient and the patient taking redress on release from hospital. There is a very real danger that such a situation could develop, and I am sure that Deputy Lee would agree with me on that point. While I agree with the principle of section 9 that a patient should be entitled to all of the information necessary, the provision should be studied very carefully before being written into legislation.</P>
    <P>At column 1847 of Volume 418 No. 7 of 28 April 1992 of the Official Report Deputy Fennell said:</P>
    <P>People with mental health problems are regrettably the poor relations of the health services. Mental health has a low priority in terms of budgetary or monetary planning. There is a great need for broad-based reform which would concentrate on reducing overcrowding in our institutions, developing community facilities...</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Fennell that mental health in any way has a low priority in terms of budgetary or monetary planning. The document <i>Planning for the Future</i>, published in 1984, was the first major report on any area of the health services in the eighties. Other reports, such as the report on the elderly <Col N="251" /> and the report on persons suffering from mental handicap, followed that publication. I pay tribute to Mr. Barry Desmond that that report was prepared in his time in this House. It was the first of many reports. That does not suggest that mental illness is low on the list of priorities, it suggests that it was very high on the list of priorities in the early eighties.</P>
    <P>No discipline in health care has developed to the extent that psychiatric treatment has in the last 25 years. Modern drugs have dramatically changed the pattern of management of mentally ill patients. Deputy Fennell refers to the need to develop community services. We can be proud of the extent to which we developed our community services in the eighties at a time of financial constraint. The Department and the health boards were responsible for drawing up development plans and those plans were initiated, and many of them were implemented throughout the country. In 1958 there were 22,500 patients in psychiatric hospitals and at the end of 1991 there were 7,800 patients. That is a dramatic reduction. No other area of health care has changed so dramatically in a generation and has been so beneficial to the public, particularly those who are mentally ill.</P>
    <P>It is important to look too at developments in psychiatric services in hospitals. Many acute psychiatric patients are now treated in our major general hospitals. New major acute psychiatric units have been established in such hospitals as Cavan, Tralee, Rocommon, Naas and so on. It is encouraging to see the old Victorian building which was the psychiatric hospital in Sligo being sold to be used as a hotel. It is encouraging also to see that the Grey building in Cork has been closed. There have been major developments in the hospitals and in the community facilities. There has been the development of hostels, day care centres and workshops.</P>
    <P>An area which needs to be looked at and which was touched on by Deputy McCartan, is a relationship between <Col N="252" /> psychiatric hospitals and the Central Mental Hospital. The dividing line between guilt for crime and psychiatric illness is very thin. I am sure we all know people in prisons who we feel should be in psychiatric hospitals and <i>vice versa.</i> There is an area there where I would like to see patients from rural areas being treated in their own psychiatric hospitals rather than in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    <P>Another area at which the Minister should look is escorting patients, particularly violent patients, to psychiatric hospitals. I commend the Garda for their co-operation but they are constrained to an extent by the 1945 Act in that they can only transport a patient for detention for longer than six months, which is totally against the modern trend. The Minister should look at that.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Fennell in her Bill, the Bill is defective. It is not far-reaching enough and it is not comprehensive. It is in the best interests of the patients for us to wait for the Minister's Green Paper and discuss it. Knowing the Minister, I have no doubt that he will bring legislation before the House expeditiously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Fennell for bringing this matter before the House and the Minister for his reasonable response. I hope the Minister's response will be reciprocated and that in the final analysis Deputies will understand that a Green Paper to address the matter in a far-reaching way is very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to relatively recently the care of psychiatrically ill patients was Victorian &mdash; there were Victorian buildings the length and breadth of the country which were never suited to caring for psychiatrically ill people. A couple of years ago when the inspector for mental hospitals visited Our Lady's Hospital in Cork which housed psychiatrically ill patients, he was appalled at the standard of the building. He was appalled when he saw what were obviously rodent droppings in the rooms, the state of the building in general and that human beings should be <Col N="253" /> obliged to live in such conditions. This was not just true of Our Lady's Hospital in Cork, it was also true of other psychiatric institutions.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, what is hidden from the public eye is often forgotten, and what is not seen is not spoken about. This is one of the major reasons I compliment Deputy Fennell for bringing this matter before the House and the Minister for the consideration he has given it.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have made considerable progress in caring for psychiatrically ill patients, but that is not to say there is not a very long way to go. The document &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; represents the first genuine progress in the care of the psychiatrically ill here in this century. Day care centres have been opened throughout the country to care for people in their own communities. This kind of futuristic thinking was lacking up to recently. A human being is entitled to the environment in which he or she can be most comfortable. In the care of the psychiatrically ill, except in extreme cases it would be fair to say that the fairest way to treat such people is within their communities where they can integrate with people they know, doing things daily in places with which they are well acquainted. Locking people away in large institutions, in large concrete jungles, was never and could never be a recipe for addressing a psychiatric illness.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that the proposals of &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; will not work unless the problem of sheltered employment is addressed urgently. Irrespective of the state of a person's health, but certainly when a person is psychiatrically ill, there is need for an occupation. In many cases it will not be possible or feasible for people residing in hostels around the country, in day care centres, to be fully occupied, a fact to be regretted. In the day hostels established nationwide to date there had been a certain degree of success in that patients accommodated there are fully occupied daily, returning to their hostels in the evening, another category of patient who would best benefit from sheltered employment. Indeed, the matter of sheltered employment will <Col N="254" /> have to be addressed by some Government, and the sooner the better, if we are to care adequately for the psychiatrically ill in our community. I contend that implementation of the proposals contained in the document &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; will not succeed unless adequate sheltered employment is guaranteed.</P>
    <P>One matter which distresses me enormously, which should have been addressed many years ago and which must be addressed now, is that of accommodation for adult mentally handicapped persons. It is very wrong that, as we approach the end of the 20th century, mentally handicapped people, with nowhere to go, should be housed with psychiatrically ill patients suffering an altogether different disability. To say the very least it is Victorian, in this day and age, that there should be such an inadequate supply, indeed shortage, of accommodation for our adult mentally handicapped. Knowing that he has the capacity to do so, it is a problem I should like to see this Minister address urgently. Funding will have to be found for the provision of this type of accommodation. If we do not succeed in doing so we shall be failing in our social duty in this respect, as has been the case since the foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>In that context it would be remiss of me not to refer to the outstanding work being done daily &mdash; 365 days a year &mdash; by the Rehabilitation Institute of Ireland. Their singular unique contribution to the training of mentally handicapped people is very often not recognised for what it is. I know that very many people with a disability have been assisted back into the community by the Rehabilitation Institute of Ireland. Such people have been reintegrated into the community, their dignity intact, because of the training provided by that institute. Their role in Irish society should be lauded for the wonderful thing it is.</P>
    <P>In general terms by way of progression of the proposals contained in &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; I should like to see established a system of sheltered employment in the community, a continuing shift from institutionalisation, so that people with <Col N="255" /> mental illness may live, indignity, in places with which they are well acquainted. I sincerely hope that the good work begun under the auspices of the document &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo; will continue. It would be my hope also that we will continue to remove patients from long-stay accommodation and buildings, more relevant to an age long past.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Fennell on having introduced this Bill, she alone having been the standard bearer for psychiatric patients' civil rights since 1972. Successive Ministers for Health, and, in the main, Ministers for Health of the present Government, have been totally remiss in safeguarding or defending the civil rights of psychiatric patients. Indeed, in the course of his remarks in the House on 28 April 1992, the present Minister admitted that when he said the following about one of his departmental inspector's report:</P>
      <P>Some of the conditions described by the inspector were extremely disquieting and should have no place in a modern day health service.</P>
      <P>I will repeat that because it is a most significant statement on the part of a Minister for Health:</P>
      <P>Some of the conditions described by the inspector were extremely disquieting and should have no place in a modern day health service. What was even more disturbing was the fact that in so many instances the level of service provided fell so far short of the standards one would reasonably expect to see in place.</P>
      <P>The Minister continued to say:</P>
      <P>I accept that the excuse for some of this was due to resourcing difficulties &mdash; a very fancy phrase &ldquo;resourcing difficulties&rdquo;&mdash; but the standards of accommodation and quality of service varied so greatly that much of it cannot be blamed simply on lack of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put that statement into <Col N="256" /> plain, ordinary language that people on the street use. &ldquo;Resourcing difficulties&rdquo; sounds nice but means simply a lack of finance. I will endeavour to further define that phrase and describe them as the Fianna Fáil cutbacks for which the Minister at long last accepts responsibility. It has not happened so far in the history of this Dáil of which I am aware but the Minister, judging from his remarks, is now accepting responsibility. It is another example of the evolution under the present Government of a most unchristian, uncaring attitude to the most vulnerable members of our society, our fellow brothers and sisters in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>We have not yet seen the Minister's Green Paper on Mental Health. In addition, I saw no mention in the Minister's contribution of a charter for mental hospital patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be included; it has already been prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be. I heard the Minister speak recently about a charter for patients in general hospitals. It is much more important that patients in mental hospitals, many of whom are deprived of their basic civil rights, should have a charter in this day and age and I would respectfully ask the Minister to consider its provision. I call on the Minister, first, to establish this charter for mental hospital patients, with a judge to research complaints, second, to establish a system of complaints and, third, to establish a system of investigation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatLee" hpid="Dr. Lee Dr. Lee">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the same judge to draft the charter to include the proviso that the aim of the hospital and the duty of all staff be to service the needs of patients at all times; in this case the paient must be paramount, providing for a mandatory censure and, if necessary, prosecution of all errant staff by the relevant health authority. There must be a proper complaints procedure which will deal with <Col N="257" /> complaints about staff, conditions and treatment. Fourth, I should like the charter to provide for the establishment of an inspectorate of mental hospitals to replace the present inspector of mental hospitals post. The chairman of the inspectorate should be a lawyer or an ex-judge while the investigator should be a member of the Garda Síochána or a person who has experience of carrying out investigations. The inspectorate should also include members of the medical profession &mdash; consultants, general practitioners and community psychiatric nurses, and any other back-up staff required.</P>
      <P>Fifth, the charter should insist that organs cannot be removed from patients either living or dead. No psychiatric patient, with or without his permission, should be subjected to experimental drug trials. Sixth, nurses in mental hospitals should be recruited &mdash; this is open to debate &mdash; from nursing staff in general hospitals who wish to specialise in this branch of medicine. I accept that this is probably a matter for An Bord Altranais under the auspices of the Minister. Nevertheless, I should like this provision to be included in a charter for psychiatrically ill patients.</P>
      <P>Seventh, nurses working in the mental hospitals system should, on a regular basis, be able to take one year's break to work in a general hospital. Eighth, non-political visiting committees who would have 24 hour inspection rights to all areas of mental hospitals should be set up. These committees should be of short term duration, lasting one to two years, and should be recruited from various interested bodies and by way of press advertisements. At present many members of visiting committees are political appointees. The present visiting committees who have responsibility for visiting psychiatric hospitals and overseeing mentally handicapped services are, in part, made up of political appointees and comprise 12 members of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not yet made public the inspector's report for 1988-89. Even though this scandalous situation did not evolve under the Minister's stewardship, <Col N="258" /> he has to accept responsibility for it. One can justifiably ask why is this the case? This report has not been made public. Why has there been a three year delay in publishing the 1988-89 inspector's report on the mental hospitals? It seems extraordinary that this situation should have been allowed to evolve. One can also justifiably ask if there are cases in this report which are grossly damning of the psychiatric hospital services. From the best information available to me, I believe part of the inspector's 1990 report was made public last June at a meeting of the Eastern Health Board. Much of that report dealt with the psychiatric hospitals in Dublin and contained alarming information.</P>
    <P>Trainee gardaí and prison officers should spend at least four weeks working in psychiatric hospitals as part of their training. I have called for this measure before both inside and outside this Chamber which I am certain will save lives in Garda or prison cells at a later stage as many members of the criminal fraternity have mental, drug, drink and social problems. More voluntary groups should be encouraged to work on a voluntary basis in psychiatric hospitals. Psychiatric patients need to meet people other than hospital staff. They also need to be treated in a more friendly environment, a home atmosphere, and need to be in normal surroundings. The volunteers who visit these hospitals could include non-violent prisoners, FÁS trainees, personnel from the Army, Navy or Air Corps, women's associations, men's associations and religious groups.</P>
    <P>As a general practitioner and community doctor, I welcome Deputy Fennell's Bill. I have first hand experience of the shortcomings, trauma and heartbreak which mental illness causes. It is perhaps the most insidious of all illnesses; it is certainly one of the most difficult illnesses to treat. Many mental patients are in their prime, they are physically perfect. We are all familiar with the picture of chronically depressed patients sitting in a room looking into space, oblivious to all around them. While they may seem to be in good physical health I can assure Members that <Col N="259" /> they are not. We are all familiar with the unfortunate patients with a psychiatric disorder who run amok in the community and are a danger to themselves, their families and the community and who are committed to psychiatric hospitals under temporary restraining orders. We are also too familiar with the problems caused by the 1945 Mental Treatment Act.</P>
    <P>Her article in today's <i>Irish Press</i> entitled &ldquo;Philomena's Story&rdquo; gives an account of a tragic story. This unfortunate lady tells about how she was forced into a psychiatric hospital. She had no history of psychiatric illness or alcohol related problems. She was committed to a psychiatric hospital against her will. It would appear that she was committed solely on the false claims made by her husband. This is one of the problems caused by an inadequate and unamended Act. Murphy's law states that if it can happen it will happen. Unfortunately, it happened in this instance. The 1945 Mental Treatment Act has been described today as internment without trial. That is an inflammatory definition of that Act. A new pressure group called Wrongfully Institutionalised People &mdash; WIP &mdash; have called on the Minister to establish a review system for the victims of the 1945 Act. They have urged the Minister to adopt, as an interim measure, Deputy Fennell's Bill pending the introduction of a new mental health Bill.</P>
    <P>The public at large do not realise that when a person is compulsorily committed to a psychiatric hospital he loses many of his civil rights. In many cases, when they are discharged having been successfully treated, they become productive members of society on whom their families depend but because of this committal they experience many social difficulties.</P>
    <P>Life insurance is very difficult to get, bank loans are virtually impossible to obtain, as are credit cards, if one wants them. They experience severe problems with passports and visas, a loss of friends due to the social stigma and, last but not <Col N="260" /> least, perhaps the most profound stigma, poor credibility in the family law courts &mdash; that applies to males and females.</P>
    <P>Another example which typifies the serious shortcomings of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 is documented in today's <i>Irish Press</i> and gives a balance to the story. It refers to a young man in his 30s who was committed as a result of allegations by his wife and brother-in-law after he consulted with her family about her drinking problem. He is now receiving psychiatric treatment for problems caused by the electric shock treatment he received while involuntarily committed. The Minister must urgently amend the 1945 Act. In fairness to the medical profession these cases are the exception rather than the rule. Such loopholes as exist in the law must be closed off urgently.</P>
    <P>In recent days I have had extensive consultations with other general practitioners and doctors in the psychiatric services and we have no problem with a built-in requirement for two qualified doctors to sign the temporary commmittal form, Form No. 6, about which there has been so much talk. On the first page of that form the person's name, address, age, sex, marital status, religion and occupation must be filled in. There is a separate section for committal whereby the applicant must state relationship to the person whom he wishes to commit, whether it be husband, wife or relative &mdash; it must be a blood relative rather than an in-law. There is a section on the form where if no relatives are available somebody else may apply for a committal order, for example, the community welfare officer. On the reverse of the form is the section which is the cause of so much controversy, the requirement that there should be the signature of one doctor. It is a simple, straightforward form to complete. Part III, which refers to the order for reception and detention, is very important and it states:</P>
    <P>I have considered the above application and certificate and I hereby order that the said person be received and detained in the mental hospital <Col N="261" /> named in Part I of this form as a temporary patient and as a chargeable patient.</P>
    <P>Signature: . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</P>
    <P>Person in charge of the hospital or an officer of the hospital authorised to make a temporary chargeable patient reception order.</P>
    <P>There are various notes and conditions attached to that form.</P>
    <P>The form which relates to private patients is virtually the same, but two doctors must sign this form. It also contains a section on order for reception and detention of the patient. To put into context this whole matter of the signature of one doctor for a public patient and two doctors for a private patient one must go back to the time the Act was introduced in 1945. At that time it was decided that for many reasons &mdash; for example, geographic remoteness &mdash; it would be virtually impossible to find two doctors who would be in a position to examine a mentally disturbed patient. For example &mdash; I hope the people from the various parts of the country that I mention take no offence &mdash; if a patient in Connemara west, the remotest end of the Ring of Kerry or the Fanad peninsula, needed to be urgently admitted to hospital for treatment it would be impossible to find two general practitioners to sign the form. Hence the requirement for a single signature. We should remember that this Act was introduced in 1945 after the war when petrol was in short supply and there were very few motor cars. That is why only one signature was required.</P>
    <P>I further suggest that at two o'clock in the morning in a remote part of the country it would still be almost impossible, to obtain two GPs to certify the patient. A patient who is extremely disturbed, agitated, violent and a danger to himself and to those endeavouring to calm him will, in these circumstances, be denied vital, early and urgent treatment because of a loophole in the proposed Bill. A balance must not be lost.</P>
    <P>When a patient is admitted to hospital <Col N="262" /> he or she must, under the Act, be examined by the person in charge of the hospital or an officer of the hospital authorised to make a temporary chargeable patient reception order. This means in practice that the consultant or the senior registrar on duty must examine the admitted patient within 12 hours before that person is certified as an in-patient.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that these doctors are highly trained medical personnel. Nowadays in practice consultants and senior registrars list on the chart &mdash; indeed, this must be the practice for all future committals &mdash; the reasons they must make this order absolute &mdash; for example, chronic and severe depression, danger to the person concerned or to his or her family, severely mentally disturbed or possible suicide. This practice must be made mandatory. It will be another fail-safe mechanism. No person, least of all a doctor, is perfect. We all make mistakes, but we must learn from them. I reiterate that we in the medical profession have no difficulty in agreeing to amending the Act to provide that two doctors must sign the form.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the psychiatric service is the poor relation of the health services the &ldquo;fag-end&rdquo; of the caring service. It gives me no great pleasure to say that the Department have neglected the psychiatric services. Commonsense, that rarest of commodities, will demand that this Act should be updated. It is the Minister's responsibility, and it behoves him as a medical practitioner, to do this, and I am sure he will.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Fennell on bringing forward this Bill and on the work she put into it. Most speakers have given due recognition to her efforts in this regard. The legislation dates back to 1945 and I believe everybody will agree that since then there has been great change in attitude towards mental health. I know Deputy Fennell is fully <i>au fait</i> with the developments regarding the policy document, Planning for the Future, which was introduced in 1985. If we are to address the area of mental health and give due recognition to changing attitudes and changes in mental health since 1945 we <Col N="263" /> will have to introduce very wide-ranging legislation. The previous speaker referred to the Minister's speech of Tuesday, 28 April, in response to the Bill. He read a couple of specific lines and I would now like to focus on one or two of those sentences.</P>

      <P>A massive vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty is vitally important for this country. Let there be no doubt about that. The benefits are far-reaching and if we have the ability to reap the benefits we will progress as a nation. A vote in favour of Maastricht is a vote for economic union for the benefit of the country and has nothing to do with a moral decision. While I accept the legitimacy of the points being raised by various groups they should not could the issue facing the people on 18 June.</P>
      <P>A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote means that we will be integrated into a single market of 300 million people. When the Channel Tunnel comes into operation we will be the only island nation on this Continent. We will have golden opportunities in the food production sector. After the malaise that has affected the food processing industry over the past number of years has been sorted out we will get back to producing quality food for which there is an unlimited market. Despite all the doom and gloom about food mountains, there will always be a market for quality products and we can produce the best in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism offers us unlimited opportunities. Tourism means that people visiting our country have the opportunity to move out into the country instead of being concentrated in large hotels in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway. We need to develop tourism in the north-east and north-west more so than in any other area of the country because of the number of farmers who have to survive on small holdings. Agri-tourism has a great deal to offer but this cannot be developed if the infrastructure is not in place &mdash; in layman's language if we have not good county roads on which people can travel to the lakes and rivers and other scenic areas. We make no apologies to anybody for seeking to develop our infrastructure. The Minister, Deputy <Col N="265" /> Geoghegan-Quinn, spoke about cohesion and about the development of light rail transport in Dublin. We are entitled to benefit from cohesion and to the transfer of resources from central government to rural areas. While I make the case for my own area, it also applies to Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and parts of Kerry and Cork. It is only fair and reasonable that there be a transfer of resources. If that is done I have no doubt that we can reap the benefits, and tourism will be a big factor in our economy in the years to come.</P>
    <P>It is now generally believed that sun holidays are not good for health and that because of our mild climate we have more to offer. People will come if the infrastructure is in place and the accommodation is available. I hope that my contribution has not gone unheard. There is no point in my making relevant points if the Ministers who now have the opportunity to do something do nothing. If there is a change of Government in the months ahead they may then not have that opportunity as they will be replaced by people who have the ability to do the job.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn spoke prior to the last Government speaker but when I read through her speech I was disappointed to learn that she did not refer at all to the Protocol, which is affecting the consciousness and attitudes of women. I have great regard for Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn because I know she has an insight into the feelings, fears and aspirations of Irish women. We would have welcomed the opportunity to hear her views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this Bill and endorse the amendment in the name of my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe. I deeply regret that this debate on the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill and the broader discussion on the Referendum of 18 June is so clouded by the bitterness and division over the Protocol and the question of abortion rights for Irish women. We have to take full responsibility for this <Col N="266" /> and no blame can be attached to the Community or any of its institutions for the dilemma in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Like most Members I am deeply committed to Europe for many reasons. I do not see our membership of the Community in terms of greater funding alone, bigger grants and an unending source of finance, the gravy train as it has been called. Financial assistance is important to underdeveloped countries; we are a poorer country in comparison with other countries in the EC and we need the transfer of resources. We can see the benefits of EC grants: our roads have been upgraded, indeed the character of rural Ireland has been changed by a more efficient infrastructure. EC funding has focused on training, employment, education, health facilities, our environment, our work practices and above all on legislation on equality and fair treatment at work. However, I regret that the predominant thinking is that the EC is a gravy train and that we will get money from it. We have to think of what we can offer Europe and how we can integrate better into the Community.</P>
    <P>All of this would count for nothing if the predominant point of EC membership, the creation of peace in Europe for the past 50 years, was not such a fundamental outcome of the Community. During this period there has been a classic demonstration of how nations can and do co-operate on issues fundamental to everyday life. If countries can work towards social and economic goals they are unlikely to develop aggressive or destructive relationships. This was part of the inspiration behind the original Treaty of Rome. The farsighted vision of the architects of the European Community should be saluted today. In voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the Maastricht Treaty we are giving a vote of confidence to this continuing peace and the ability to work together while identifying differences at national level. How much wiser it is to use our resources and our energies collectively to improve the lot of men and women both within the Twelve and outside than to destroy each other and create wastelands through war <Col N="267" /> and strife. Indeed the prosperity and the harmony among people through European unity is in stark contrast to the destruction, killing and waste over 20 years in Northern Ireland. The profound regret is that the spirit of Europe and the unity and co-operation we have seen in operation there fails to be understood by the aggressive and destructive groups on both sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland. It is regrettable that they do not see that unity and co-operation and an understanding of each other's points of view &mdash; which is part of the principle of Europe &mdash; could help to solve the difficulties experienced in the different communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the single market and our greater integration with people of other groups will, I hope, isolate the terrorists in time and encourage the communities that shelter them to give up ghetto-living and relate to the broader island of Ireland and to the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>I support European unity for many of the economic reasons the Taoiseach stated in his speech. I welcome investment to clear up our pollution problems, to continue to contribute to training in jobs, to create more jobs and to secure those we have. I welcome investment in road building, particularly in my constituency which has many of the country's blackspots. While I agree with much of what the Taoiseach has said my apprehension about the implications for women of voting for the Treaty makes me less enthusiastic. He and the Government have displayed a degree of arrogance and insincerity in regard to the feelings of women from the start of this debate. There is real and understandable anger and frustration among women and women's organisations at the approach being taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the insertion of the Protocol, without any reference to this House or indeed to the Cabinet &mdash; as we have now been led to believe &mdash; no debate or consultation with any of the groups representing women's issues, such as the Council for the Status of Women, <Col N="268" /> indicates a most cynical approach by the Government. This Protocol, in effect, closes off access of the European Courts in cases such as the right to information relating to Article 40.3.3º. Without a by-your-leave, the men at the centre of the negotiations, Deputy Haughey and Deputy Collins in one stroke eliminated a basic right of women in the misplaced notion that it would secure the referendum. I question whether they ever thought they would have to come back and answer for what they did in this country.</P>
    <P>We may have a new Government, a new Taoiseach and a new Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I do not see them doing any better collectively. They do not inspire confidence in relation to the vote or the campaign. That is why the referendum vote is and will continue to be linked to abortion. Women want to know, and with absolute surety and clarity, what will happen after 18 June and what action will be taken. We have had the spectacle of one injunction taken by the State on a 14 year old girl preventing her from travelling to Britain to have an abortion, which was her agreed choice and that of her parents. We now have the suggestion that there may be other cases, all of which were predicted in 1983. It has taken some time to come about but it is now a reality. Women in this country are living under a cloud of uncertainty and dread. I should emphasise it is the likelihood of such injunctions and the almost inevitability that they can happen, as much as the reality of their happening, which creates such a demoralising climate and makes a statement about women's lack of full status as persons and Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>Whenever the issue of the Protocol comes up the Taoiseach constantly presumes we are seeking &mdash; those of us who want to have some action &mdash; to have the matter resolved so as to influence our EC partners or what happens in Europe. We are not: we are saying, please make a clear statement of intent for ourselves, for the electorate here but specifically for women who are anxious and uncertain, so that women can freely and happily <Col N="269" /> vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on 18 June to that which we all aspire to which will be good in the long run for women and men. As it is now, more women will be proud of being European than of being Irish. Being Irish and female is to have to make excuses, it is to have to rationalise, to explain why one is not to be trusted to make decisions that are right for oneself. It is akin to being treated like a criminal or an immature child. The Government can and must change this if they are to eliminate the risk of defeat by women on 18 June. I hope they will do it because it is the right thing to do for half the citizens of this country and perhaps eventually that message will get through.</P>
    <P>My clear message to the Government tonight is: do not try to move back from the Supreme Court judgement earlier this year; do not try to turn the clock back to before 1983; do not try to resolve the right to information issue by some sort of Dutch auction to satisfy the narrowminded and conservative lobby who would like to see the right to information severely restricted. No one has the right to say what I or any other woman can read in the area of health. Why should my reading material be censored? It is ludicrous that women's magazines such as <i>Cosmopolitan</i> and other magazines coming into the country have had pages taken out to ensure that I and every other woman who will buy them will be prevented from finding an address, and that is outrageous and deserves to be defied. I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Government to listen to what women are saying and not to feel threatened by it and to bring forward their statement of intent before 18 June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and other speakers have already underlined the importance of this debate and of the decision which the Irish electorate will face on June 18 next concerning the ratification of the Treaty on European Union agreed at Maastricht. It is not an exaggeration to say that the outcome of the referendum will determine the whole future of this country &mdash; whether it will continue to play a full role <Col N="270" /> in the European Community and through the Community in world affairs, whether it will seize the opportunities and face the challenges that will become available from the developments provided for in the Treaty and whether it will follow the only course that offers real hope for the improved welfare of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I want to concentrate on the economic aspects particularly as they affect employment and to refer also to the social provisions of the Treaty on European Union. For me, as Minister for Labour, a most encouraging and positive feature of the Treaty has been the recognition for the first time in Community law that the promotion of employment should be the main social objective of the Community. That provision is all the more pleasing as it was proposed and pressed for by Ireland in the course of the negotiations leading to Maastricht. In more practical terms, we can be confident that it will lead to even more positive Community action to help promote employment and that employment considerations will be taken fully into account in the formulation of other Community policies across a whole range of areas. Reinforced by a strong positive mandate from the people on June 18, the Irish Government will ensure that this new and specific commitment to employment promotion by the Community will be fully honoured.</P>
      <P>The EC Commission study entitled &ldquo;The Economics of 1992&rdquo; has estimated that the creation of the Single Market could increase Community GNP by up to 7 per cent, could create 5 million nett jobs and make the price level approximately 5 per cent lower than it would otherwise be. A more recent Commission study gave a very positive evaluation of the likely economic impact of Economic and Monetary Union. In particular, it suggested that when account was taken of the dynamic effect of a number of factors, European Monetary Union could more than double the beneficial influence of the Single Market on output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substantial gains to the Community that are expected to flow from the Single Market and European Monetary <Col N="271" /> Union are, of course, of great significance for this country. As we are all aware, the Irish economy is extremely open, with exports of goods and services amounting to about two-thirds of our national output last year. This proportion is exceeded in the Community only by Belgium and Luxembourg. It is, therefore, in our interest to have an external environment which is conducive to economic growth based on price stability. Just such an environment will be created by Economic and Monetary Union. It is against such a background and supported by the Community's commitment to economic and social cohesion that policy in Ireland can be used to the maximum effect to generate growth and, of course, to generate employment.</P>
    <P>Economic and Monetary Union will also benefit Irish business and individuals through the elimination of currency transactions costs in trade and tourism. In fact, the benefits will be proportionately higher for Ireland than for most other member states because the Irish pound is not a widely used means of international payment. Our competitors will, of course, have less costly access to the domestic market but, on the other hand, Irish exporters will have more opportunity to gain in bigger market shares in other member states.</P>
    <P>A key element in the development of a dynamic Community in which the breakdown of internal barriers releases the full potential of the member states is the motion of economic convergence. Ireland is committed to the goal of European Monetary Union and is determined that it will satisfy the convergence criteria necessary for full participation at the appropriate time. The narrowing of differentials, accompanied by the expected lower inflation in European Monetary Union, should have a particularly beneficial impact on Ireland's public finances and on domestic investment. The commitments obtained on economic and social cohesion, particularly in relation to the Structural Funds, will be of considerable further benefit.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the most serious <Col N="272" /> problem facing this country. This Government have placed unemployment at the top of the agenda and have geared all of their economic and social policies accordingly. Since 1987, the Irish economy has performed remarkably well particularly so in the face of global recession which has proved the deepest since the thirties. GNP growth averaged 4.5 per cent a year over the last two years while, in 1991, our trade surplus showed a year-on-year increase of £300 million as a result of Irish industry increasing their share of overseas markets. Since 1987, private sector employment increased by 70,000. That is in stark contrast to the mid-eighties when we lost 80,000 jobs in manufacturing industry as a result of the policies being pursued by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition. It is clear, however, that growth of this order is not enough to accommodate the numbers out of work and those entering the labour market for the first time.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that 36,000 net new jobs were created in the year to end-April 1990. This increase occurred on the back of the highest GNP growth in 22 years. It is apparent, however, that if any inroads are to be made into the problem of joblessness through the creation of real, self-sustaining jobs, what is required is a number of years of unprecedented economic growth.</P>
    <P>Failure to ratify the Treaty means that Ireland will not be participating to the full, it will condemn us to the economic margins of the Community and, because of the probable diminution of the Structural Funds in real terms as well as the loss of the competitive advantage to be gained by convergence, it will mean that the economic growth needed to solve our unemployment problem will probably never happen.</P>
    <P>The effects of the Treaty of Rome with regard to freedom of movement have already been felt in Ireland. Emigrants are now far more likely to go to continental Europe than in the past. The mutual recognition of qualifications is likely to accentuate this trend over the next few years. The Irish economy has much to gain from this mobility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> The Culliton report noted that &ldquo;the perception of many managers that there is not a skill shortage may itself be part of the skills problem facing Irish industry ... The real skills gap is one which exists between skill levels in firms in Ireland and that of the best practice firms in competitor countries&rdquo;. A contribution to bridging this skills gap can be made by those who while working abroad, become aware of new processes and techniques. On their return, they have the ability to introduce and apply them to improve the competitiveness of individual firms and, by extension, the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>FÁS have taken a number of initiatives in this area. A recent major initiative is the proposal to locate FÁS employees in employment offices of appropriate EC member states following official discussions. Such persons will also help out in relation to accommodation and acclimatization generally. I would emphasize the voluntary nature of this initiative &mdash; there is no question of forcing unemployed persons to take up such employment.</P>
    <P>In view of the serious unemployment position and the opportunities offered by membership of the Community we would be failing the young people of this country if we did not bring job opportunities to their attention and assist them in every way possible when working abroad.</P>
    <P>A well trained workforce is a key element to the competitiveness of industry and business generally. While firms themselves must ensure that their workers' skills are regularly upgraded and updated to meet the changing needs of the firm, workers must be assisted and encouraged to develop their overall skills to enable them progress and contribute to the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>Training is also the key to getting the long term unemployed and disadvantaged a foothold in the labour market. They must be provided with training opportunities which will give them a qualification recognised both on the domestic and Euro labour markets. The Government will continue to accept responsibility for the training of those <Col N="274" /> out of work to the extent that funds are available.</P>
    <P>It gave me great encouragement to participate in the informal Social Affairs Council in Portugal when my ministerial colleagues from the other member states agreed unanimously that increased funding should be made available for vocational training.</P>
    <P>Of late there has been increasing recognition &mdash; or, more appropriately a re-emphasising &mdash; of the primary role of employers in training. This development is influenced by the belief that employers are in the best position to know what skills are required in their businesses. They are also in the best position to provide such skills. In many prosperous companies, there is an increasing recognition that investment in training gives the enterprise a competitive edge.</P>
    <P>The markets in which our enterprises are operating and the processes we are using to produce our goods and services are changing continuously. This involves continuous major restructuring in the firm. Such restructuring can only take place in the context of a well trained and well motivated workforce. As I already said, employers are in the best position to produce such a workforce. Such training needs to cover not only the operatives but also supervisors, technicians, technologists and managers themselves. What is involved is a new way of thinking on the part of the managers of our firms.</P>
    <P>Our training arrangements in the sixties and seventies tended to be based upon British practice. As we have widended our European horizons, other national models appear, including that of Germany and Switzerland. The German apprenticeship system covers around 370 trades as against about 30 designated trades in Ireland. This system is characterised by employer funding and the chambers of commerce administering the system. Certification of skills is also a major element of the system. This is another good reason there should be a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote for Maastricht.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour I am responsible for the European Social Fund. It provides massive financial support for <Col N="275" /> training and employment programmes in this country. In the five year period to end-1993, over £1 billion, or almost 40 per cent, of all the Structural Funds resources approved for Ireland will have been received from the European Social Fund. When allied to matching Exchequer finances, almost £2 billion will be spent on those vocational training and education programmes which are co-financed by the European Community. Equally the increase in the annual level of European Social Fund transfers has been dramatic. In 1989 ESF receipts totalled £139 million &mdash; in 1991 £371 million was transferred to Ireland from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>In formulating my contribution to the national development plan, which will inform the shape and content of the next Community Support Framework for Ireland, I will assess the effectiveness of the high levels of expenditure on training to date which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>As the Minister with responsibility for the European Social Fund, I am determined to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these payments. The achievement of that objective may require a better balance in the types of training now being assisted by the Structural Funds, with a greater emphasis on training for those sectors with the greatest potential for growth and the provision of jobs.</P>
    <P>Its achievement certainly requires a far more positive approach on the part of employers in identifying and providing for their own training needs and in influencing the content and relevance of vocational training programmes provided by State agencies and institutions. If the enhancement of the job prospects of trainees dictates that the quality of that training which is co-financed by the European Social Fund and by the Irish Exchequer is a more fundamental criterion than throughout numbers, then that reality will be recognised and acted upon.</P>
    <P>Our own apprenticeship system is being recast to move to a standard reached basis rather than the time served <Col N="276" /> basis that existed up to now. The question remains of extending, like the Germans, the number of occupations covered by apprenticeship and this is being examined as a matter of urgency. I believe it can cover not only manufacturing industry but consideration should be given to including a range of sectors, including the voluntary sector and the services sector.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the future of the apprenticeship system will be supplemented by the new job training scheme. Both employers and trade unions fully support our efforts to develop an on-the-job training system financed by employer and the European Community. The scheme is a work based training programme provided by employers on their premises in co-operation with FÁS acting as the State agency ensuring quality. Trainees will follow a structured and supervised programme of training in a work base setting tailored to individual needs. The scheme extends to continuing the consensus approach which has been so successful in correcting our Exchequer difficulties.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt but that employment is the principal means of integrating people socially and economically into society. Work skills and training are a necessary precondition on the part of the job seeker for employment. We will be looking to the Commission in the negotiations on the Structural Funds to support our efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>Our domestic arrangements for assisting the long term unemployed were considerably expanded last week with the announcement by the Taoiseach of a number of measures to be implemented in areas covered by the area based strategy to combat long term unemployment proposed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>It is important for Irish workers to appreciate that the Treaty on European Union contains a very powerful social dimension which will ensure that their interests continue to be advanced. The Treaty provisions and the consequential <Col N="277" /> Community actions to help employment promotion are, of course, of primary interest to secure the creation of new jobs, the preservation of existing jobs and the promise of better prospects for those who are unemployed to get back into employment. In addition, the Treaty contains provisions which are clearly intended to continue the upward development in employment standards to which workers are entitled. There is already a public recognition that our membership of the European Community since 1973 has contributed positively to improved working conditions in various ways. A particular area in which great improvements have resulted has been in the area of equal opportunities for women. The Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty has a specific provision for further improvements in the equality sphere.</P>
    <P>Reference to the Social Chapter of the Treaty leads me to comment on the question of the UK &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; from the proposed revision of the social provisions of the Treaty. Ireland in common with ten other member states, other than the UK, would have wished that it had been possible to move forward as Twelve in this important area.</P>
    <P>Our decision to subscribe to the Agreement between the Eleven fully accords with the general firm commitment to the promotion of social cohesion in the Community. The Government believe that the Agreement strikes a reasonable balance in the division of responsibilities between the Community and national and local decision making levels in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. The priorities given to employment and social partnership are of particular significance for Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the question of possible loss of competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK in particular, the position is that the provisions of the Agreement to which the Eleven are committed are likely to be used very sparingly and that the existing Treaty provisions relating to social policy will be the normal basis for Community actions. Indeed, the draft Directive on Organisation of Working Time, which of all the <Col N="278" /> draft directives would have most implications for competitiveness, will probably be the subject of a common position, which will bind all Twelve, at the next Social Affairs Council meeting on 24 June.</P>
    <P>There are also specific provisions in the new Agreement that social policy measures must have regard to the need to maintain the competitiveness of the Community economy and to the conditions in each of the member states. Small and medium-sized enterprises are guaranteed special protection because the Agreement lays down that measures adopted under it by the Community must avoid imposing undue burdens on small and medium sized enterprises in a way that might inhibit their creation and development.</P>
    <P>The principle of subsidiarity which is enshrined in the Treaty has particular relevance for measures in the social area. This principle means that desirable actions are taken at Community level only where they cannot be implemented as effectively at a lower level &mdash; national, regional and sectoral. Thus, much more flexibility is allowed to suit the laws, practices, traditions and circumstances of individual member states provided common objectives can be achieved.</P>
    <P>It may be of special interest, however, to draw particular attention to the fact that among the matters proposed for decision by qualified majority voting at Community level are measures designed to promote employment equality between men and women and actions to help the integration of disadvantaged groups into the labour market.</P>
    <P>These arrangements will ensure that women as well as categories of persons which experience particular difficulties in getting employment can be assisted by direct Community action. This special treatment will, of course, be available to those concerned in Ireland only if the Treaty itself is ratified on June 18 next.</P>
    <P>A most significant and welcome trend in the Agreement on Social Policy attached to the Maastricht Treaty is the very greatly increased participation of the social partners in Community decision <Col N="279" /> making. This development is entirely in line with the concept of social partnership which already operates so successfully in this country.</P>
    <P>The Agreement provides for consultation of the social partners as a matter of right on the advisability and content of Commission social policy proposals. This is in line with a proposal put forward by Ireland at an early stage of negotiations. The Government are confident that this provision for direct involvement of the social partners will result in proposals for Community instruments and other actions which are more realistic and more relevant than some proposals which have been put forward in the past because the first hand experience and knowledge of the partners will be given full opportunity to influence the terms and provisions.</P>
    <P>In social policy areas where the Community has competence under the Agreement, the possibility of implementing such collective agreements by a decision of the Council of Ministers at the request of the social partners is allowed for.</P>
    <P>The Council will decide on such proposals in accordance with the decision making arrangements applicable to the issues concerned under Article 2 of the Agreement. This entire arrangement represents quite a radical new initiative which will require further consideration as regards the manner of its operation, not least by the social partners themselves as they will be faced with new challenges as well as new opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am convinced a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to the Treaty on European Union offers significant opportunities to increase employment, reduce our unemployment, reduce emigration and simultaneously increase our living standards. As a nation we are dependent for our standard of living and our employment on our exports and by extension on our competitiveness. European Monetary Union offers us the opportunity of becoming more competitive. In addition, Structural Funds offer us the means of overcoming our relative lack of development compared <Col N="280" /> to our EC partners and the disadvantages arising from peripherality.</P>
    <P>Under the existing Structural Funds we will have received in the five years to 1993, £1 billion of aid towards our training and employment scheme. The funds have allowed us to increase the skills level of our workforce and job seekers and help the long term unemployed and the early school leavers. The reality is that without these significant financial transfers the Irish Exchequer could not on its own have provided the quantity and quality of the training and education available to so many of our young people and those at work.</P>
    <P>Clearly more needs to be done. A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will secure the resources to enable our training and education systems to continue to work in the interest of the Irish labour force and our young people now at school. For our part, we will continue to improve the quality of our programmes through more effective linkage with economic and industrial development activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The name &ldquo;Maastricht&rdquo; was not very well known in this country a couple of years ago but no name is better known here at present. However, no name is more associated with confusion than Maastricht. Everybody recognises the necessity to ratify the Maastricht Treaty for all the very good reasons advanced by various people so far; it would be irresponsible for any substantial group to do otherwise. However, it is equally irresponsible of the Government to introduce a Bill to enable a referendum to be held at a time when there are other issues, totally unrelated to the Maastricht Treaty, entangled in the debate on the present dispute.</P>
      <P>Because of the importance of the ratification of Maastricht, it is incumbent on the Government, even at this stage, to make a last ditch effort to extricate the other issues from the debate on Maastricht. If they do not, and in the unfortunate event of the Maastricht Treaty being defeated, then the public will visit their anger and vengeance on the people who failed to disentangle those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> There can be no doubt about the importance of Maastricht for people in all levels of society, for the unemployed as well as the employed. Whatever hope and chance we have depends on becoming part of a greater integrated Europe and gaining some of the opportunities we should get from that greater economy and great continent.</P>
    <P>There was a strident tone in the Taoiseach's speech today, a bit of the old soldier trick, calling on the people to remember what had been done. He referred to payments made to women under the equality legislation. He seemed to think as a result that women should thank him for being a decent and upright man and to support him because he had been so kind. His speech was patronising and dangerous, it would have been far better if he had looked carefully at all that has taken place &mdash; admittedly not planned by him or anybody else &mdash; which, unfortunately, brought this debate into conflict with other issues.</P>
    <P>The freedom of information, the right to travel, etc., are issues which affect women, whether we like it or not; the Taoiseach and members of the Government may delude themselves into thinking that they are not issues but I assure them that on the day of the referendum they will find that they are. I warn the Government, even at this late stage, to try to disentangle the issues and not to allow Masstricht to become confused with another argument which has no bearing on it or on European integration, or on issues which need to be determined domestically by the people elected to this House. I fear the outcome if that does not happen. It will do no good for the Taoiseach or members of the Government to call on the Opposition parties to do their duty. The Opposition parties will do their duty, unlike the Fianna Fáil Party on many occasions when they were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government do their duty and ensure that people voting in the referendum have only one issue to decide, namely whether we want European integration and all that goes with it. If the Taoiseach and the Government <Col N="282" /> can do that, they will do themselves and the country a great favour. Let us consider the alternatives. If by some mischance the whole thing goes wrong and the Maastricht Treaty is not ratified, how will our European partners regard us? Will they consider that we are constructive Europeans who want to be part of Europe? Will they think we want to share this new brotherhood, the ideal of the greater Europe and the Single Market, the Europe envisaged by Schuman, Monnet, Adenauer and others? Will they regard us as supportive members of that group in the event of our failure to ratify the treaty?</P>
    <P>Conflicting views have been expressed by the Taoiseach and others during the past few weeks as to what might happen in the event of failure to ratify the Treaty. They have trotted out various unfortunate possibilities. That should spur them on to ensure that all other issues are removed from the arena beforehand. I again appeal to the Government to take on board the sentiments expressed in the Fine Gael amendment. If not, they alone will have to bear the brunt of responsibility for anything that may go wrong afterwards. There would be no sense in claiming that they need a general election or in postponing a general election and hoping that people would forget about the problem. There will be no sense in having a series of referenda afterwards if this referendum does not yield the proper result. Those other referenda would then be irrelevant and would be carried out by a different Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour referred to the proposal to locate a number of FÁS trainees abroad. That is not exactly what we intended would happen in the greater Europe. It was intended to bring the jobs to the people as opposed to bringing the people to the jobs. The Minister went on at some length to point out the benefits of sending people to jobs in Germany, France, Holland and elsewhere. That might be a good thing as a last resort but it does involve emigration, the export of our young people. It is an indication of the object failure of the economic policies pursued by this administration that after <Col N="283" /> almost three years in office they are suggesting that our people should go abroad to be trained for jobs abroad. It is a sad reflection on the performance of the Government. They should consider whether we are getting the full benefits from an integrated Europe and whether it might be better to encourage people to invest here so that we would not have to export our people, young or middle aged, to seek job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Most other European countries have a very low rate of unemployment, including some of the EFTA countries. Austria, which is seeking membership of the EC, has an unemployment level of 5 per cent, as compared with 21 per cent here and growing fast. It must be recognised that we have failed to bring the jobs to the people, yet the jobs are there. We are in the European economic area and it should be possible to encourage the providers of jobs to come to where the people are.</P>
    <P>Other issues will arise after 1996 relating to European defence and security. I do not want to advance beyond the Maastricht Treaty. A number of people have genuine fears about neutrality at some stage in the future but that matter does not arise now. I have always felt that if we are part of a community which is economically, monetarily and politically united we cannot opt out of a security policy. It is not in our interests to opt out of a defence and security policy at some stage in the future. If we have an input at the decision-making level we have a better chance of influencing those decisions than by opting out, stepping aside and staying neutral. The Community will grow larger and will include a number of smaller countries, some with a history of neutrality. The more of those countries which are involved in influencing and taking decisions the better it is from our point of view.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union will be of much greater benefit to our exporters than we can imagine. A person travelling through the Twelve member states and deciding to exchange money at each airport would have very little left out of a <Col N="284" /> £100 at the end of his travels, perhaps only £10 or £12. One can readily recognise the difficulties this presents for business people. The elimination of these difficulties must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the Government recognise the need to ensure the smooth ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. If they do not, the consequences will fall on them. There will be no sense in pointing the finger at this side and suggesting that the Opposition parties did not do their work or were unfair or raised various issues. The issues are there and the onus is on the Government to resolve them and decide which should be taken first. The outcome of the referendum will depend on that. It is the epitome of irresponsibility for the Government to suggest that they can go forward on 18 June in the knowledge that there are two other issues, totally unrelated to economic matters, still unresolved. The Government should have the wit to resolve them &mdash; they certainly have the responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred earlier to the need for all the other responsible parties in the House to come on side. We do not have to come on side; we have been on side all of the time. We fully support the concept of European union, the Maastricht Treaty and all that goes with it. I wonder, though, whether the Taoiseach and his Ministers could say that they are fully united, that they have no problems in that regard and that they approach the impending ratification of the Maastricht Treaty without any worries or fears. I doubt that the Government themselves are 100 per cent behind the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. Fianna Fáil may have had a spectacular parliamentary party meeting recently that seemed to indicate unanimity on certain issues, but I wonder just how much of that was for the benefit of the consumer. What bearing might changes or the eruption of new events between now and 18 June have on the smooth exterior displayed by those on the other side of the House? I am sure that the two Ministers sitting across the Chamber at present fully understand what I am saying. I hope that none of those things happen but if they do the <Col N="285" /> Government will have the responsibility of resolving any ensuring problems. The only way to resolve issues that might come up is to clear the decks beforehand and allow the Maastricht Treaty to be debated on its own merits. Then and then only can the people of Ireland fully evaluate the benefits accruing to them from support for the Maastricht agreement, discuss dispassionately all of the issues involved in the agreement and as a result give their opinion freely and in the knowledge that they are not entrapping themselves on any issue.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty to consider the amendment proposed by Fine Gael and to examine whether it might not be in their own interest, if for no other reason, to allow the debate on the Maastricht Treaty to be dealt with separate from the debate now taking place, which involves several issues.</P>
    <P>If we ratify the Maastricht Treaty &mdash;and I hope we do &mdash; that will be taken in Europe as a signal of Irish willingness to participate fully in the greater Europe. It should be recognised in Europe as an indication of the support we have always displayed for greater European union and it should be recognised by us as a willingness to become completely involved in what will eventually become the United States of Europe. It should also be a means whereby we in Ireland recognise that not only can we expect to get benefits in direct payments, appeasements and subsidies from Europe but that we can also expect the Government to take on board the clear indication that we should have a right to equal opportunity within the European sphere; equal rights to jobs, equal rights to housing and equal rights to a good quality of life. Equal opportunity should apply as much in this country as in any other better and more advanced part of Europe. If we do not work towards the achievement of that end, then there is not much sense in being part of a European union. If we do not now recognise that all does not begin and end with subsidies, set-asides, handouts and easements, then our membership of Europe will be of only minimal benefit to us. We will never perform our <Col N="286" /> full role unless we recognise the need to become Europeans in the full sense by getting the equal opportunity that is our right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty of European Union is historic in its own right and is particularly historic from the point of view of education, in that for the first time education is being given a central role in a document of such seriousness. For that reason, the Treaty is critical to the entire future of the education system.</P>
      <P>The decision to be made on 18 June is very serious. It is important that in the remaining weeks both sides of the argument take part in a debate that is open and honest. The decision to be made is about the European Community. It is about committing ourselves not only to the financial, economic and structural surrounds but also to an ideal and to a direction for the Irish people. Therefore, all of the argument and counter-argument about funding and structures should not be taken lightly. The upcoming decision is about more than money; it is about the way we want to live in the decades and generations to come. It is a critical decision for this country.</P>
      <P>The decision taken on 18 June is as I have outlined. It is not about the other issues that have dominated the debate up until now. The decision concerns the economic future of the European Community and the commitment to an ideal of uniting Europe as we progress.</P>
      <P>In the few moments available to me I should like to address two issues in particular, economic and social cohesion and new or strengthened areas of Community action. Those issues are dealt with in a comprehensive way in Chapters V and VI of the White Paper on the Treaty on European Union. I intend to examine them specifically from the educational point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the White Paper points out, cohesion is the term used to describe the objective of progressive reduction in economic and social disparities between the more and less affluent regions of the Community &mdash; an objective which lies at <Col N="287" /> the heart of the 1957 Treaty of Rome. That Treaty established the European Social Fund. Since then, two other Structural Funds &mdash; the European Regional Development Fund and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guidance Section &mdash; have been established. Together, the Structural Funds constitute the chief Community financial instrument for the promotion of social and economic cohesion.</P>
    <P>Following the coming into force of the Single European Act in January 1989 the Commission proposed a major reform of the Structural Funds and a doubling of the resources available to them by the end of 1993. The current agreement between Ireland and the Commission governing the use of the Funds, the Community Support Framework (CSF), remains in force until the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>The income to the Department of Education in respect of training measures included in the CSF is as follows: £107 million in 1990; £107 million in 1991; an estimated £114 million for 1992; and £121 million for 1993.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Social Fund has been a major influence in the rapid expansion of our third level system over the past three years. It has also been a significant factor in the development of vocationally oriented courses at post-compulsory and post-leaving certificate levels.</P>
    <P>We are also receiving in excess of £92 million over the period of the CSF for the development of the third level educational infrastructure from the European Regional Development Fund. The new regional technical college in Tallaght is one of the projects included in this programme. Other projects in the vocational education committee sector, as examples only, include: Bishop Street College, which has a new college building at phase I; the College of Catering, which is undergoing major extension; and 28 smaller projects at ten regional technical colleges. Projects in the university sector include major extentions to Dublin City University, St. Patrick's College at Maynooth, <Col N="288" /> UCC and UCG. In addition, more than £15 million is being spent over the four-year period 1990 to 1993 on replacing obsolete equipment or providing new equipment in the third level institutions.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in February, the Commission published their proposals for the development of Community policies from 1993 to 1996. The aim of the policies is twofold: first, to create the conditions for economic convergence needed to make the transition to the final stage of Economic and Monetary Union in January 1997 and second to make Community economies and businesses more competitive. Again the Structural Funds will have a vital role to play. They will be based on the same principles, namely, concentration on regions whose development is lagging behind, a programme based approach, partnership between the member states and the Commission and additionality. But while the principles remain unchanged, improvements will naturally be sought in the effectiveness with which they have been applied up to now. In particular greater flexibility will be introduced into the management of the funds in order to enable them to be more responsive to emerging needs.</P>
    <P>As far as the size of the post-1993 funds is concerned, the Commission proposes an increase of two-thirds in the overall allocation for the least prosperous regions. The Treaty also makes provision for the establishment of a new Cohesion Fund, access to which will be limited to Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland. Taking the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund together, the Commission are proposing a doubling of the allocation to Objective 1 regions in the 1993-97 period.</P>
    <P>We welcome the main thrust of the Commission's proposals which we see as a satisfactory basis for the negotiations on a five-year framework. At this point, we will be arguing for a doubling of allocations to Objective 1 regions from the Structural Funds alone. We will also seek to persuade the Commission that it should agree to a higher rate of intervention than 65 per cent on the Social <Col N="289" /> Fund. We will argue that the necessity to provide 35 per cent of expenditure by way of matching funds will make it very difficult for us to meet the criteria laid down for transition to the final stage of Economic and Monetary Union after 1997. This is clear recognition of this problem in the Commission's proposals where it says:</P>
    <P>Steps should be taken to help countries concerned to achieve tighter discipline and greater efficiency in budgetary policy and thus work for more convergence and cohesion. The rate of assistance could be adjusted accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that Ireland was very successful in securing a substantial share of the Structural Funds available under the current CSF. We will be seeking to at least maintain and, if possible, increase our share in the next round. We will use arguments such as the high rate of unemployment and our peripheral position in the Community to strengthen our claim for a greater share of the funds.</P>
    <P>I will deal in some detail later with the inclusion of a new Article on education in the Maastricht Treaty. I refer to it here because it stengthens our arguments for Social Fund support for activities which were hitherto regarded an ineligible by the Commission. One example that immediately comes to mind is undergraduate programmes in the higher education authority institutions. We will be putting it to the Commission that there are many reasons Ireland's position is essentially different from that of other member states in this regard.</P>
    <P>To give some indication of the magnitude of the task facing us, I would like to draw attention to the fact that enrolment in full-time higher education courses in Ireland increased from 21,000 in 1965 to 75,000 in the current year, or an increase of 350 per cent over a quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the National Institute of Higher Education and the regional technical colleges contributed <Col N="290" /> greatly to this development. Another point we must bear in mind is that Social Fund assistance has accelerated the rate of increase in enrolments, especially following the major reform of the Structural Funds in 1989. As Deputies are well aware we have given an undertaking in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to provide an additional 8,800 places by the middle of the decade. That will bring the number of places to 90,000 or about 45 per cent of the relevant age cohort.</P>
    <P>It may be revelant to point out that we have a higher proportion, 17 per cent of our population in the 15-24 age bracket than any of the ten Community partners for whom we have comparative statistics.</P>
    <P>Participation rates were a recurring theme in the interventions of my colleagues at the recent informal education council in Madeira. It was noteworthy that my German and Dutch colleagues were talking about rates of 30 per cent &mdash; that is, registration rates at third level. This level of participation in affluent western European countries certainly put the size of the task facing us into perspective. It is a point which we will bring forcefully to the Commission's attention in the discussion on the new funds.</P>
    <P>Another relevant consideration is the fact that some of our young people enter third level education before they reach the age of 18 and they leave with a university or other third level qualification before they are 21. That is to say that they reach the labour market with a high level of skill on average four years earlier than their counterparts on mainland Europe. In spite of their youth their performance is recognised as being equal if not better than the highest international standards. I think that on the basis of these facts alone the Commission will look favourably at extending to undergraduate courses in universities the kind of support which has been available up to now for certificate and diploma courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and the RTCs.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that we will be unmindful of the needs of those young people who do not seek or do not obtain <Col N="291" /> a third level place. As the House is aware, the National Council for Vocational Awards has recently been put in place to provide a coherent framework for the assessment and certification of vocationally oriented courses taught at post-compulsory and post-leaving certificate levels. The growth of post-leaving certificate courses in recent years has been as remarkable in its way, as the expansion that has taken place at third level. These courses are an enduring monument to the creativity of the professional staff throughout the second level sector and, in particular, the vocational education committee sector. They have been developed in response to locally identified training needs and they have achieved a substantial measure of credibility with local employers. This whole development could not have taken place without the support of the Social Fund. It is now the task of the NCVA to develop a national framework for these courses and to structure them in such a way that the qualifications to which they lead can achieve national and international recognition.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I see three main points of emphasis in our approach to the Commission in the negotiations on the next round: first, the rapid rate of expansion of courses under the current CSF has outstripped the level of available ESF support. This was an inevitable outcome of our decision to draw down ESF aid in four more or less equal instalments from 1990 to 1993. The fact remains that a significant proportion of our current eligible training activity is fully funded by the Exchequer. This is an obvious case for an upward adjustment of ESF aid under the next agreement; second, the continuing expansion of our population in the 15-25 years age range and the consistent growth in demand for post-second level education and training makes our position unique among our Community partners. Deputies are well aware of our commitment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to provide 8,800 additional third level places over the first few years of the programme; and, <Col N="292" /> third the proven capacity of the education system, as independently assessed under the current CSF, to respond effectively to the training needs of Ireland's young population. We will be stressing that in our negotiations.</P>
    <P>The education system of member states is the responsibility of national or sub-national authorities. There is no essential change in that position in the new Treaty. In fact, Article 3 (b) of the Treaty lays down that</P>
    <P>in areas which do not fall within its executive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action be better achieved by the Community.</P>
    <P>I quote this Article to reassure the Dáil that there will be no direct intervention by the Commission in the internal administation of individual education systems.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of this debate it is necessary to draw a clear distinction between the scope and purpose of the Structural Funds which I have just described and the scope and purpose of the new education Article in the Treaty. I do this because there is a danger that the basic difference between them does not clearly emerge in the text of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise, therefore, that the Structural Funds are included in the Treaty under the title of Economic and Social Cohesion. Aid from the funds is made available to a particular member state on foot of an agreement between its national authorities and the Commission in respect of programmes developed and delivered by the member state and jointly monitored by it and the Commission. That is to say that, while the funds are governed by the Council regulations, their operational focus is essentially bilateral.</P>
    <P>The focus of the new education Article on the other hand is essentially Community wide. It is included under the <Col N="293" /> title of Social Policy, Education, Vocational Training and Youth and its purpose is to provide an explicit legal basis for Community wide action in the field of education. Such action has been undertaken in the past, for example, ERASMUS, LINGUA, COMETT using Article 128 of the Treaty of Rome as the legal basis.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a specific Article on education, however, strengthens the hand of the Commission in its desire to play a more active role in the promotion of joint action in the field of education throughout the Community. The areas of action which have been identified as suitable for Community treatment are developing the European dimension in education, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of the languages of the member states; encouraging mobility of students and teachers, <i>inter alia</i> by encouraging the academic recognition of diplomas and periods of study; promoting co-operation between educational establishments; developing exchanges of information and experience on issues common to the education systems of the member states; encouraging the development of youth exchanges and of exchanges of socio-educational instructors and encouraging the development of distance education.</P>
    <P>As the House will have seen in the White Paper &mdash; page 76 &mdash; Ireland tabled a proposal for a Treaty Article on education policy at an early stage of the negotiations. The teaching and dissemination of the languages of the member states is a matter of special concern to us and has been identified as such in the Green Paper recently published. We are strong supporters of the relevant Community action programme &mdash; LINGUA &mdash; in that regard. Moreover, distance education was a major theme of our Presidency and we were successful in getting the Council to agree that the Commission should prepare relevant proposals. This initiative will be brought a step further through a set of proposals to be submitted to the forthcoming Education Council on 1 June under the Portuguese Presidency. The effect of the new <Col N="294" /> education Article will be an expansion of activities in the specified areas and the likelihood of increased funding now that education figures in the Treaty in its own right.</P>
    <P>The insertion of an Article in the Treaty on education was a priority for Ireland. We are very pleased it has been included with such prominence. I believe that we have a lot to gain from more intensive interaction with other national systems within the Community at a time when we are embarking on a major reform of our system. I took advantage of the recent informal Education Council in Madeira to learn more about educational reforms being undertaken in other member states, particularly in Denmark, where they have recently embarked on a major structural reform of their system. Moreover, the enthusiasm shown by Irish teachers and students for participation in Community programmes such as ERASMUS, COMETT and LINGUA bespeaks a genuine interest in acquiring educational experience in another member state. It was obvious to me during the informal Council that this positive attitude by Ireland towards Community action in the field of education is warmly welcomed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, I have also embarked upon a major reform of the Irish education system. The fundamental objective of this reform is to equip the education system to meet the major challenges facing our people as we face into the 21st century. I trust it will create a new framework for development and for the most effective use of resources as they become available, from national and European sources.</P>
    <P>To sum up then the Maastricht Treaty carries rich promise for the development of educational services in Ireland through the prospect of substantially increased aid from the Structural Funds. We are giving careful thought to a coherent negotiating strategy which will address the issue of securing as close as possible to a doubling of the Structural Funds and as close as possible to a doubling of the existing level of appropriations <Col N="295" /> to Ireland as an Objective 1 region. We are well aware of the counter-arguments likely to be made by the larger member states, on the one hand, against what they would regard as excessive allocations to the Structural Funds and of the other Objective 1 countries on the other, who will be arguing their case for an increased share of whatever amount is finally agreed on for these funds.</P>
    <P>We support strongly the thrust of the new education Article of which we were one of the originators. It presents no threat to the autonomy or integrity of our national system while, at the same time, providing a welcome opportunity to participate in educational developments which have a clear Community dimension.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is an historic Treaty, particularly historic for education in that central to the Treaty is a section on education and the Community's commitment to developing the educational systems across Europe in the future. I cannot overstress that that is a major breakthrough for education. It is historic in that, in previous discussions and decisions at European level while some account was taken of education, there was no clear, central Treaty-based role for education. If for no other reason than the future of Irish education we should give very serious consideration to a substantial &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote for the referendum on 18 June.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset also and I want to finish on this note, it will be a serious decision to be taken on 18 June; it is about Europe, about the economy of Europe, about the structure of Europe. In a way we must stand back from it because it is about much more than all that: it is about whether we commit ourselves to working with our 11 partners to build a European Community that will be able to take on whatever the 21st century brings; will be a vote of confidence in the direction in which we want to go. Therefore, while it is about detail, about very tangible funding, very important day-to-day structures, more than that, it is about committing ourselves to <Col N="296" /> the ideal of a united Europe, one in which Ireland can play its full role, one in which a small nation like ours can play an exciting role out of all proportion to its size and strength. For that reason I urge the public to give this Treaty its full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá i nGaeilge agus ní bheidh mé ach nóiméad mar tuigim nach bhfuil ach beagán Gaeilge den Pháipéar Bán agus den choimriú ar fáil.</P>
      <P>I assume that my constituents who are Irish language speakers &mdash; by right, their first language &mdash; may expect between now and 18 June a version of this rather flimsy, misleading document entitled <i>The Maastricht Treaty: A Short Guide</i> and the White Paper. In fact, it is symptomatic of our whole approach that we would be amending a Constitution in which the primary language is the Irish language without explaining it in that language. I want to use my time as carefully as possible. There are a few points I wanted to make. This is one of the very rare opportunities we are afforded of clarifying a number of matters. I spent yesterday and today attending a meeting of the European Affairs Committees in Lisbon, represented at which meeting were European Affairs Committees of all of the member states. I took detailed notes which the people on the Government side can confirm with their representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make one point immediately. I listened with great care to what the Minister for Education said and, before him, the Minister for Labour. It was made absolutely clear in the German contribution to that meeting I attended that Maastricht and Delors II are separate projects. This can be confirmed by the simple fact that, at the end of the meeting as I left with Deputy Barry and others, no agreement had been reached because of the German refusal to have any reference in the summary of the meeting in Lisbon to Delors or to additional spending. Indeed, it was a very pessimistic two days. One could summarise the German position by saying simply: not a Deutschemark more. What I find very <Col N="297" /> unreal is that, when we talk here about this Treaty on European Union and a referendum to implement is provisions, we would have a consistent, systematic presentation of commission proposals as though they were Treaty protected or had been decided. Let us bring a little reality into this debate. When will we hear from a Minister the proportion of the Community budget necessary to implement what the Ministers for Education, Labour and others spoke about?</P>
    <P>We should remember that the Delors II package, which proposes to raise the Community budget from 1.2 per cent to 1.37 per cent, is in difficulty. At the Congress of European Trade Unions in Berlin some time ago the lowest figure to implement the social provisions of Maastricht was put at 3 per cent. Other papers which were circulated had figures as high as 8 per cent. The representative of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Bundestag and Bundesrat, and speakers from all parties, the Free Democrats, the SPD and Chancellor Khol's party, were at pains at the Lisbon meeting to say they would not be asking for additional taxes to fund an increase of the level suggested by Delors. They were supported in this attitude by the people who will hold the next Presidency, the British. It is very unfair that the Irish public are being misled by this confusion of Commission proposals and Treaty text. They are not being treated with honesty.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to make is very important. In international law one may not tear up one's previous Treaty commitments and substitute them with new commitments: one may take on additional commitments. It was said at the launching of the White Paper, in a flair of publicity, that we would be leaving Europe as if the founding treaties no longer applied. Let it go out from here that the founding Treaties stay in place and that the Single European Act is still in place. This blackmail of suggesting that existing benefits will be lost and future benefits will be imperilled is just what I have described it, an unwelcome blackmail as a substitute for reasoned presentation on the Treaty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> Third, I want to contrast the way in which our partners in Europe are treating this debate with the way we are treating it. In the Danish White Paper a section was given over to arguments against ratification. This was welcomed in Denmark and at the meeting in Lisbon from which I have just come. Yet, this was not considered in the Irish case. The Belgian Parliament have had five reports on five different aspects of the proposed treaty. When will we have an opportunity &mdash; in the limited time available this evening I will deal with one or two aspects &mdash; to discuss, for example, the implications of common currency? When will members of the Cabinet tell us about the changes which will apply as we meet the convergence criteria? When will the Minister for Finance come in and say: &ldquo;I propose, because of the obligations of convergence, to make the following proposals&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Recently Ireland submitted convergence proposals of a technical kind to Europe. Would it not be more honest to say to the people, &ldquo;here are the implications&rdquo;. I applaud those newspapers which attempted to publish a guide to Maastricht in terms of the requirements on us, for example, the 60 per cent goal for the ratio of Government debt to gross domestic product; an inflation rate of not more than 1.5 per cent above the average of the three lowest inflation rates of member states; a 3 per cent maximum for the ratio of Government deficit to gross domestic product at market prices; an interest rate which is no more than 2 per cent above the average of the three lowest inflation rates and no devaluation for two years within the narrow band of the EMS. They are the five convergence goals.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a question which I want answered. If the Government are to meet these five goals it seems they will be heading into a budgetary strategy which will be deflationary at European level and at home. I put the question to the Portuguese Finance Minister yesterday and he spoke of low inflation growth. It was perfectly clear about what he was speaking: he was speaking about measures <Col N="299" /> which could not ever reflate. It is important on the five convergence criteria to think of the moment in Europe's economic history when these are produced: they are produced on the tail of Thatcherism in Europe and at a time when there are no Keynesians advising governments.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the five convergence criteria is that the Government will be required to defend their currency and interest rates but precluded from intervening by way of public spending and investment to impact on unemployment. Yet if this is the situation, if the five convergence criteria put a certain discipline on us, we will then be told that these will be balanced by cohesion. Cohesion is mentioned in the text of the Treaty. I wish to refer to the German argument on cohesion. I might say as an aside that people are at this stage accepting that that component of the so-called increased funding is gone. The reason we are having the referendum on 18 June before the end of the Portuguese Presidency is that unless a last minute effort is made by people like the Taoiseach and others there will be no agreement on the Delors II package in the Portuguese Presidency and it will be difficult to get agreement on the Delors II package in the British Presidency. This Alice in Wonderland description of expenditure in the past and in the future by the Ministers Deputies Cowen and Brennan is misleading the public. If the public are to be invited to accept the Treaty on European Union the Government should talk about the Treaty. They are the only Government in Europe attempting to say that the Treaty and the Delors package are inextricably bound. There is a view in Greece which comes close to the Irish Government's position and there is a view in Portugal which is sympathetic but does not take the same line. The other member countries are saying explicitly that the Delors II package is for political negotiation. It is dishonest to suggest that the Delors II package is a fact and that it can be used to balance out convergence.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of their rather predictable <Col N="300" /> economic diatribes members of the Cabinet throw in a few European flourishes &mdash; Mr. Mitterand used to talk about how he will finish this century and start the new one, well known rhetorical flourishes. We should be clear about the text of the Treaty. If the text of the Treaty was so important for the Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, and the people who speak on agriculture, was it not a little silly to trot off and slip in a Protocol to satisfy the demands of a fundamentalist minority here? If it was so important why was it necessary to slip the little Protocol in and put so much at stake? The Government want it every way in the argument.</P>
    <P>The Danes have two or three Protocols &mdash; they were worried about second homes being bought in Denmark &mdash; and it is arguable whether what they are suggesting could ever be implemented legally. That is what their Protocol dealt with. The Netherlands have a Protocol which deals with something practical while Ireland slipped in Article 40.3.3º. I have heard Deputies say that all 340 million people of the European Community, represented by their Governments, are so anxious about our situation and hang-ups that they have made a solemn declaration to honour anything we might dream up to give content to Article 40.3.3º. I want to make this point very clear when speaking about our common European home, the text of this Treaty and European citizens. I have spent all my life in politics trying to make the case for equality between women and men. What I am asked to do, if the Government do not change their minds within the next week or ten days, is to accept that the economic benefits will be so important that women will say: &ldquo;The Treaty will have effect from 1 January and by November the sub-committee of which the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and others are members will have made up their minds, and women will be all right&rdquo;. Fianna Fáil canvassers will knock at doors and tell the man about the economic benefits of the Treaty but <Col N="301" /> if the woman answers the door they will tell her she will be all right by Christmas. What a pathetic and insulting approach to this referendum which is being rammed through so as to avoid the flak of the Delors II package collapsing and, therefore, the flimsy half truths of the White Paper falling apart.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the convergence criteria, and perhaps I am wrong about their deflationary impact in Europe. The debate on the Single European Act was very interesting. The Federation of Employers in Europe argued that we needed the benefits of an integrated single market first and that residually there would be social expenditure. The European trade unions argued that they were inextricably linked, that they were co-terminus. The sub-committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities debated that matter and came down in favour of the co-terminus nature of the social dimension and the benefits of an integrated market. The difficulty about that is that unemployment has risen in every European country. People might ask what are the consequences of the convergence criteria for unemployment in a country with 20 per cent of its available workforce unemployed. They may ask how do these convergence criteria lead to investment. The answer will be that they will create a climate from which will come investment and from investment jobs will be created. The people will then say that they heard that before in regard to the Single European Act as well as on other occasions.</P>
    <P>In relation to monetary proposals envisaged in the Treaty are they specific and precise? When it comes to the economic side the proposals are very vague in relation to the social impact. There is no attempt to deal with the running together of the monetary and the economic sides. As regards politicial union the Taoiseach has said, when asked the direct question about changes in 1996, that he would favour a referendum. The text says that what will happen in relation to new Treaties and the process of ratification will be the result of the constitutional or legislative action of members. I would ask the <Col N="302" /> Taoiseach which is the case. He should answer the people in relation to Title 5 and the balance of J1 and J4. Will there be legislation or a constitutional referendum? He should put in print now that a referendum will be held.</P>
    <P>Equally in relation to this extraordinary Bill before us, Part II, paragraph 5º states: &ldquo;No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted... acts done or measures adopted by the European Union or by the Communities or by institutions thereof&rdquo;. That also applied to the Single European Act, but this Bill adds: &ldquo;or by bodies competent under the Treaties establishing the Communities, from having the force of law in the State&rdquo;. What bodies are they? Is it the European Central Bank or the Western European Union? Are the Government happy, for example, with the surveillance procedure? Will people know that it is the Central Bank and not the Minister for Finance who will nominate people onto the European Central Bank? One man put it to me three weeks ago in Brussels that this was all about getting a seat on the Council of the Bundesbank. We had good news from them about their deferred drop in interest rates, but of course that was part of the propaganda from Dublin Castle that interest rates were to be lower. Where is the democratic accountability of the European Central Bank to Parliaments such as this? If the Minister for Finance will not be accountable in certain matters let us hear it now.</P>
    <P>The nonsense about the increase in Structural Funds is very misleading. There is the view in France that it wants increased Structural Funds made available to the maverick countries so as to be able to invest and to deal with the impact on its immigration policy. Germany has proposals not only for East Germany but beyond its borders. Why do we not tell the truth about these matters?</P>
    <P>We are unique in Europe in that we have had hardly any debate on Maastricht. In contrast with Belgium with its five papers on five different aspects, we had statements. The White Paper could not be printed because of the absurd position <Col N="303" /> about the Protocol, and when it emerged it was very flimsy. The substantial White Paper suggests that the Delors II package is reality. In all ministerial statements after the launch of the White Paper there is a mixture of intimidation, that we will no longer be bound by international Treaties that we have signed, or blackmail, that we have to vote for the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>I have respect for Treaties and my vote will always be influenced by what, on balance, I have to do politically. I agree with speakers on this side about one point. This Treaty contains a Protocol that refers to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution. There is no guarantee to Irish women, in the event of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, as to the precise content of the constitutional amendment or the amending legislation that will come from the Government. In that sense, therefore, in a matter as important as this, the Government, by abusing the reality of the Delors II package, are asking us, for alleged economic benefits, to accept a lesser form of citizenship in terms of legal rights for women for at least a period until the matter is put right. If that is the case why not publish legislation giving the precise text of what the Government propose to do? Are womens' rights to be made a political football from the time of the referendum until the end of the year? That answer will affect the way I vote on a number of matters in relation to Maastricht.</P>
    <P>I see in the convergence criteria more of an obstruction in relation to public money interventions on unemployment than anything facilitating it. I see on the economic side an absense of specification in relation to transfers, particularly from the gains of an economy towards the social programme. I see in the Protocol a complete mess, slipped in by stealth. The Government's attitude to Maastricht is that we will get £6 billion, but they leave aside the £6 billion while they slip in a Protocol without debate in this House.</P>
    <P>I would raise an important question in regard to this £6 billion. I want the media to explain to people that there is no reference <Col N="304" /> to £6 billion in the Maastricht Treaty. There is reference to enlargement of funds and there is an acceptance of the principle of cohesion. There are different components to Delors II and the package could go either way. The Taoiseach, and the Government, have taken the figure £3 billion, multiplied it by two to give us £6 billion and then said the debate was about the £6 billion. We are the only people substituting a debate on the Treaty for a debate on the Delors II package.</P>
    <P>On political union, there are questions that must be answered immediately. For example, which bodies are referred to in the Bill before us? The Taoiseach should commit himself to what will happen in 1996 and whether this change will be brought about by a constitutional referendum or by amending legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I agree in principle with the point Deputy M. Higgins made with regard to the Delors II package. There is no decision guaranteeing the improvement in the Structural and Cohesion Funds. That great European Socialist &mdash; President Delors &mdash; whom I thought Deputy M. Higgins would support, has put forward proposals which he believes will lead to equality after the acceptance of the Treaty. It is understandable that members of the German delegation in Lisbon had reservations about the financial implications of the Delors package for their country because of the demands on them arising out of unification. The matter will have to be negotiated. I do not think anybody said at the launch of the White Paper anything other than that President Delors would aim to double the Structural and Cohesion Funds but that this proposal will have to be negotiated and agreed. It is possible that agreement will be reached during the remainder of the year but more than likely from January 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court decision has cast a shadow over the debate on the Maastricht Treaty. However, serious-minded politicians, and other Community leaders have endeavoured to broaden the debate to <Col N="305" /> deal with the real implications of European union for this country. We attempted to amend the Protocol and when we did not succeed the other member states pointed to the fact that the difficulties arose out of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. They rightly pointed out that this Irish problem should be resolved by referendum, legislation or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the issue is likely to hit the headlines again when another case on the right to travel goes before our courts. The Oireachtas must take responsibility for not clarifying the intent of Article 40.3.3º in 1983. As a result it has been left to the Supreme Court to interpret it and that interpretation has now created complex difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is misleading to think that if we rush in to resolve one aspect of the problem prior to the referendum on 18 June we will resolve the problem in the public mind. It is universally accepted that people have the right to travel freely but the right to information gives rise to another debate. Nobody disagrees with the need to clarify the issue but the substantive one is whether the difficulty should be resolved by referendum or amending legislation. The sub-committee of the Cabinet are dealing with this matter and I trust they will do so speedily and bring forward a suggested formula. Members and the general public should be made aware of their recommendations as soon as the Taoiseach. I hope we will resolve this difficulty. In the meantime it falls to all Members to bring the debate forward on the other major issues, which are of long term importance to this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins backed down from saying whether he is in favour of the Treaty but his leader said he would actively campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote. Recently I heard Deputy Michael Higgins being asked three or four times about his position on the Treaty and what he would recommend to the people of Galway west, but it was impossible to know his position. A certain element are trying to have a two-way bet &mdash; perhaps they may stop attacking the Government <Col N="306" /> on the Maastricht Treaty and say what changes they would like to negotiate which have not been negotiated up to now. They should stay away from the other complex issue which is vitally important but will have to be resolved later irrespective of any decision we may take with Denmark.</P>
    <P>Of course, we will remain a member of the European Community after 1 January 1993, but if we do not vote in favour of the Treaty, is it too much to expect that the other nine, ten, or 11 member states, who put so much time and effort into the Maastricht Treaty, will not meet and discuss how to put a Maastricht II package together, taking on board all that is good in economic union and the progress on social issues, environmental protection etc? It would be much easier for the Germans to accept a Delors Mark III package from 1 January 1993 if they did not have to live up to the commitments implicit in what was agreed at Maastricht. If we are outside discussions on European union, we will end up, irrespective of who claims otherwise, in the second division of the European Community. When the Council of Ministers meet to discuss and implement the new formula that will emerge in 1993, the member states that did not vote for the Treaty will find themselves left out.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I wish to make a brief comment on the media coverage of the campaign to date. Let me point out to the national broadcasting organisation that it appears to me from watching television or listening to various discussions on radio that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats are calling for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote but that the Democratic Left do not want to go into a corner; yet they say there is a lot of good in Maastricht. They will probably end up getting a great deal of coverage because they are opposed to the other parties. They will balance the necessity to agree with proposals as to what should be changed in the Treaty, thus having an each way bet on the issue.</P>
    <P>So far the national broadcasting body, both television and radio, have brought forward people who, so far as I know, <Col N="307" /> represent nobody other than themselves who have taken on various titles and are being given air time to articulate views that are opposed to the mainstream opinion of the Irish electorate. Approximately 80 per cent of the electorate, reflected in the democratically elected politicians in this House, have expressed a particular viewpoint on Maastricht. Why have RTE current affairs personnel not set up an intelligent structure to ensure that the issues, facts and views of 80 per cent of the electorate and expressed in this House are reflected on this Treaty. I hope they will take the various headings&mdash;industry, agriculture, labour, health and the environment &mdash; and have discussion programmes dealing specifically with the issues rather than personally held views.</P>
    <P>To take this issue out of the political domain I suggest that senior civil servants who have spent many years working in Brussels and in senior positions in Departments be given the opportunity to explain, in a presentation to the Irish people, what they believe has been achieved by the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. These would be detailed explanatory information sessions and the officials would answer queries on the points raised by Deputy Higgins about the implications of the Treaty on taxation, our capacity to inter-link into the European common currency, the constraints on the economy, the down side and so on and they would clarify what is implicit in a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote. If this issue is debated realistically there will be an overwhelming &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.</P>
    <P>This has been a confused debate so far. I would like to comment on some of the headings covered to-date &mdash; education, health, training and the Department of Labour. These areas make major demands on Exchequer funds which are not being adequately met. Recently I was listening to the Minister for Health and his predecessors who have a very real commitment to the £100 million Tallaght hospital which is to cater for a catchment of 300,000 people. At present the facilities at St. James' Hospital are stretched. <Col N="308" /> That once-off major project which will stand for 50, 75 or 100 years is a capital demand on the Exchequer. Only within European framework can we achieve a substantial increase in the funds proposed and a recognition in the Treaty that those headings can attract financial support from Europe. All those once-off major investments in services and facilities are implicit in the intent of Maastricht. That is what we have to achieve. Every Deputy should be prepared to look at the pluses and the minuses of accepting or rejecting the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>What does it mean to my constituents? I represent a vast urban area where there have been serious difficulties. A special task force has been set up to study the north Clondalkin area. I understand a report is about to be provided by the Secretary of the Department of Justice. I wonder what he will report under the various headings? Under education, will he highlight the need for about £10 million and the £16 million approval for capital investment under the heading of health. I have referred already to the Tallaght regional hospital. Under the heading of the environment in the late seventies and early eighties Dublin Corporation built 6,000 houses, a desirable step forward to resolve the inner city housing crisis; but £4 million to £5 million is needed for the completion of various community projects. All those major capital investments, which are needed to complete what was started some years ago, are bound into the potential or otherwise of our success in Europe.</P>
    <P>I am convinced we will have a competitive negotiating session following acceptance of the European Union Treaty. The German financial position could have deteriorated by then, and there may be resistance from the United Kingdom, but that is all part of the art of negotiation and what has been achieved so far. That was the art of negotiation in the national plan pre-1993 and is how we succeeded in getting £3 billion to improve our infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I view the potential from acceptance of the Treaty as positive and it will have advantages in industry, particularly in <Col N="309" /> agriculture and food. I hope our free access to a population of 300 million can at last see the food processing sector put on the fast track of quality development. I also hope the marketing efforts of the various State agencies can be supported by processors who are going in for brand products and quality. This is the only way in which we can progress and create long term employment.</P>
    <P>Regarding the international mobile industry and competition &mdash; a good example is Apple Computers who today are rethinking some of their groups policies &mdash; what possibilities would be open to us if we were outside the main stream of the trading bloc? Surely this is an opportunity to counterbalance the strength of the financial and trading abilities of the United States on one side and Japan and the Pacific Basin on the other. The Berlin Wall and various other barriers prevented eastern European countries from trading in their hinterland. This is an exciting and challenging time for this country. I call on RTE to provide a balanced debate so that the people are fully aware of the major economic, cultural, environmental and social benefits that will arise from a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with deep regret I have to raise the future of a section of Apple Computers at Hollyhill, County Cork, this evening. Apple Computers have been magnificant employers in the Cork city and county areas for many years. I would consider Apple to be the flag ship of Cork city industry. They gave hope <Col N="310" /> and encouragement to many. They gave work to many people and had the courage to locate their European headquarters in what was and still is an unemployment black spot in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>Last evening's statement, therefore, left the workforce in a state of uncertainty. I was up at the plant at midnight last night and met some of the workers coming out. I sensed a fear there for the future of their jobs and their families. Cork cannot endure another blow to the solar plexus of its economic base because any effect on Apple would have a domino effect on many industries that are dependent on Apple in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement made today that the IDA, Apple and the unions will be meeting this week to discuss the future of the plant. I hope the joint efforts of everybody concerned will achieve something positive. It is a time for a united action from all the political voices in Cork. I know my party will support every effort made by the Minister to achieve a positive solution. I welcome the Minister's positive attitude on the news tonight when she said she hoped that something could be got out of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent hours the question of wage costs and the scale of economy of the Hollyhill plant was mentioned. It is ironic that the jobs may be going to Singapore. Singapore is still classified as a third world country, even though it has a higher standard of living than we have. I would ask the Minister to look at the situation within the European Community where Singapore is granted concessions under the general system of preferment ranging from 4 per cent to 14 per cent. If the GSP were not in operation for Singapore, Apple might not be affected and certainly Western Digital, another casualty in Cork, might not have been affected in the past. I know it is not as simple as that and that it is a very complicated issue, but I am led to believe that the special status that Singapore enjoys will terminate in the next few years. It may be too late at that stage for many of the high tech industries throughout the country and especially the ones in Cork. I look <Col N="311" /> forward to hearing the Minister's response and I now hand over to Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Allen for allowing me in for this brief moment. The fact that Minister Wallace is also in the House is an indication of the seriousness with which we view the situation in Apple. I, too, welcome the Minister's positive response when she said that she hoped that the news may not be as bad as we now believe it to be.</P>
      <P>Cork city cannot take another blow of this magnitude. Every effort must be made to save every conceivable job in Cork in the present climate of huge unemployment. A few months ago we welcomed the extension to Apple. It is unfortunate that in this short time there is an air of doom and gloom hanging over the plant. I would ask the Minister to respond positively and she will have my full support in her efforts.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Allen and O'Sullivan and my own colleague, Deputy Wallace, and all the elected representatives of the Cork area for raising the issue. My gut reaction when I heard of this, was the same as that put forward by Deputies Allen, O'Sullivan and others who contacted me earlier today. It is that this cannot be allowed to happen. It was as if there was to be a stay on matters and if we make a concerted effort in working this through, such as has been evidenced here in the Dáil, and if we do this in an non-acrimonious and cohesive fashion we can achieve the result we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apple Computers have as yet made no final decision on the future of their printed circuit board operation. Therein lies our opportunity because there will be a review which will be concluded between mid-July and end July. That gives three months for the IDA, the political arms, the Government, the workforce and Apple themselves, who have made such <Col N="312" /> a huge commitment to Cork over the years, to put forward a case and to work confidently and competently to see that the result is what we want. Apple, with the assistance of the Government, have grown to be a major employer in the Cork area, employing in excess of 900 people. This affects not just the company but the surrounding companies who draw their strength, their economic viability from the existence of a strong, coherent Apple Computer facility in Cork.</P>
    <P>Investment in Apple has not been one-sided but represents a commitment or partnership between all concerned &mdash; the Government, Apple management and employees in Cork and Apple Computers Incorporated in the US. All have contributed to their success in Ireland. The total investment by Apple in Ireland to date is £70 million. In the last two years alone, the company invested £40 million in this country. It is that that gives us hope. That investment so recently made cannot be allowed to go to waste. In 1990, the company spent £150 million in Ireland on raw materials and components, salaries, services and consultations and there have been all sorts of spin-off industries. The conveyances used to bring people from their work at midnight will in turn be affected.</P>
    <P>Apple's involvement in Ireland has and continues to be successful. I was, therefore, somewhat taken aback when I, like the Deputies in this House, learned for the first time this morning that the company are undertaking a review which could have as one of its consequences the transfer of printed circuit board production to another location.</P>
    <P>The market for personal computer products has been in a state of rapid change in recent times. The rate of technological change in itself brings business hazards which must be addresed and kept pace with.</P>
    <P>Even Apple, with their differentiated product, have been unable to avoid the consequences of these turbulent market conditions. The company are undertaking a global review of manufacturing policy and I understand that the review will be completed by the end of July next.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> If a decision is made to transfer production of printed circuit boards elsewhere, this would permit the Cork plant to concentrate on increased production of finished products. On listening to the tape of the 1 o'clock news today I was glad to hear the local manager of the Apple plant in Cork, Mr. Pádraig Allen, refer to the fact that the company intended to make increased investment into that end of the product within the Cork factory and this would allow the redeployment of some staff presently engaged in printed circuit board production, to the assembly and testing of an increased unit in the Cork plant.</P>
    <P>The aim of Apple in Ireland and, indeed, for manufacturing in Ireland, should not be to seek to compete on the basis of cost but rather to choose to do so on differentiation and total quality. I am encouraged that Apple management today stated that they would be undertaking further investment here so as to enhance their plant's capabilities through differentiation with a view to increasing their market share. I will be putting it clearly to Apple that some re-balancing will be expected.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by re-emphasising that it is not only prudent but essential that Apple review their manufacturing options not only to survive but to succeed. We will be stressing that valueadded through differentiation is our competitive edge. I assure the House that the Department, the IDA and I will be assisting in the Apple review which is now under way. Much work remains to be done by all of us between now and the end of July.</P>
    <P>Today, at my request, I met the chief executive of the IDA and it was a thorough and comprehensive meeting. Also at my request, a top level delegation from the IDA will go to the Apple headquarters in California to discuss with the technical experts what can be achieved within the Cork plant. I want to be very clear and succinct in this regard; we now have three months during which Apple &mdash; their generousity of approach must be acknowledged &mdash; will have a review of the operation. Apple have invested much <Col N="314" /> here and we, in turn, have invested a great deal in Apple &mdash; our people, infrastructure, optimism and hope. In this review period of 12 to 14 weeks, the consensus achieved in this House tonight among the political parties, the will of the Government and the will of Apple to seek a way through this difficulty &mdash; the cohesive strength of all those approaches and my proposed input &mdash; will, I hope, have the desired effect. I hope that the reliability and strength which Apple have given to the manufacturing base in Cork will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended this matter to be the subject of a Private Notice Question but that was not possible. In the last four or five days I understand that the British authorities are now changing direction and appreciate the pressures which will be put on people on both sides of the Derry-Donegal Border exiting and entering Northern Ireland and the Republic.</P>
      <P>I should explain to the House that there are three crossing points between Derry City and County Donegal, the Culmore Road leading to Muff, Moville, the Buncrana Road at Bridgend and the Letterkenny Road which serves the eastern part of the county. Two of those check-points are closed and all the traffic has to go through the Buncrana Road, which is already busy, putting pressure on that check-point at particular times of the day when people are going to and from work. It is a great inconvenience and totally unnecessary. They suggest that traffic should use the Lifford Road-Strabane crossing but that is not convenient for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanation the British give is that they must close the check-points to carry out major developments. However, these developments are warlike creatures and a vote of no confidence in the security forces this side of the Border. They are viewed by local people as implying that the South is not serious about security and that there is a lack of co-operation between the security forces on both sides <Col N="315" /> of the Border. I thought long and seriously about this and I came to the conclusion that what the British army are doing along the Border is nothing short of creating targets for the IRA to bomb. When the IRA use a bomb to destroy one of these intimidating monstrosities they will kill human beings. The people in London who have taken a decision to construct these monstrosities along our Border will be guilty if British soldiers lose their lives. The IRA are looking for challenges and in this case there is a challenge to put a bomb in a vehicle and blow these structures to bits. It is ludicrous and I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs agrees. Indeed, both communities along the Border agree it is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Now that these intimidating, warlike monstrosities have been constructed, soldiers on each side are checking lorries to ensure that they are not carrying a bomb which would blow the place to bits. If there is a bomb on board the soldiers will not stop the vehicle getting through. The authorities seem to be obsessed with protecting these monstrosities and ensuring that the IRA do not plant a bomb. However, they are losing sight of the fact that that is not where the trouble is in Northern Ireland. They are suggesting that all the trouble in Northern Ireland emanates from the Republic but anyone with the slightest intelligence knows that is not the case. No one can hold anyone south of the Border responsible for the murders being carried out in Belfast at present. It is a wrong reading of the situation for people in London to decide security matters in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I talk to the young policemen and soldiers as I pass through Northern Ireland and some of them are very forthcoming. One of them said to me that if the matter was not so serious it would be a major joke. Sheds were built to accommodate large vehicles or buses but now they are afraid to let them into the sheds in case one of them has a bomb on board and will blow the place to smithereens; it is absurd.</P>
    <P>I do not know why this matter should <Col N="316" /> be dealt with by a Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have said this many times before in speeches on Northern Ireland. It should be the responsibility of a Minister with another portfolio, perhaps a spokesman on Northern Ireland or something of that kind. I am not saying that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, is not capable of handling it, I have the greatest respect for him and every confidence in him. I admire him but the portfolio of Minister for Foreign Affairs is not the right one to be dealing with something which concerns the people of Derry and Donegal, Tyrone and Fermanagh.</P>
    <P>Somewhere, sanity must prevail and if the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and his assistant, Mr. Mates, have any sense they will immediately start to dismantle these constructions because they merely create a target for people to be killed by the IRA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for his remarks and I agree with him. Since I have come into the co-chairmanship of the Anglo-Irish Conference, one of my main inputs indicates the concerns expressed by Deputy Harte. I am grateful to him for raising this issue on the Adjournment and I assure him that I will continue to raise these concerns with the Secretary of State.</P>
      <P>At the outset &mdash; I know that Deputy Harte will concur with me in this regard &mdash; I wish to utterly condemn the IRA attack on the British army check-point at Killeen on the Dublin-Belfast Road last Friday in which a British soldier lost his life. It is indeed a bitter illustration of the emptiness and futility of what the men of violence have to offer. Each atrocity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It copperfastens the Deputy's point. Each atrocity the IRA perpetrate serves only to deepen still further the divisions we must overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed to removing as many barriers as possible <Col N="317" /> between people North and South so that, in the spirit of the new Europe, there can be greater freedom of movement between communities on both sides of the Border. In particular, the Government are committed to minimising the disruption suffered by those living in Border communities, whether from closed cross-Border roads or delays associated with permanent checkpoints. In keeping with this emphasis on improved communications, the Government are also committed to the upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast railway line, as announced at the Anglo-Irish Conference on 27 April.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I visited last month a number of Border areas in Counties Leitrim and Monaghan. I intend to visit other border areas, including County Donegal, in the near future. I will certainly let Deputies in those constituencies know when I will visit that area. Arising from my recent visit I raised the question of the closure of cross-Border roads in all its aspects at the meeting of the Conference on 27 April. I emphasised the importance of keeping all closures under continuous review and of ensuring that the economic and social effects, as well as the security implications, are taken fully into account in all cases. Following an extended discussion, the Conference agreed that it would continue to review developments in this area.</P>
    <P>On the question of permanent vehicle checkpoints, which is of particular concern to the Deputy, issues arising from the operation of such checkpoints have been raised on several occasions with the British authorities at meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Government have urged that these measures be kept under continuous review and that the fullest consideration should be given to alternatives. Where the British authorities consider that they are unavoidable for security reasons, we have emphasised that every effort should be made to keep the inconvenience caused by these measures to the absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of whether permanent vehicle checkpoints are effective <Col N="318" /> from a security point of view, I noted with interest an article in this week's <i>Sunday Times</i> by Brigadier Peter Morton, a former British army operations officer in Northern Ireland, which questioned the effectiveness of permanent checkpoints on the grounds that they and the personnel involved are sitting targets for attacks and, because they are so visible and easily avoided, they represent a poor use of manpower resources. Séamus Mallon, MP, voiced similar concerns and, indeed, these arguments were also put to me by several people during my recent visit to Clones and Kiltyclogher. I am aware that similar doubts as to the wisdom of these installations have been expressed by the people of Derry and Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the potential disruption to traffic which is likely to arise as a result of the construction work which is about to commence on the checkpoints outside Derry. I can assure Deputy Harte that I have every sympathy for the local communities who are inconvenienced by the operation of these checkpoints on a daily basis, and who may now be faced with greater than usual disruption over the coming weeks. The British authorities are aware of my concern that such disruption should always be taken into account in the security arrangements which are put in place, and should be such as to minimise the inconvenience caused to the local population. I understand that the work which is currently being carried out will, <i>inter alia</i>, make provision for new traffic arrangements at the checkpoints so as to improve traffic flow and reduce delays in the long term.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, some initial media reports suggested that both check-points would be closed for the duration of the work. Needless to say, we immediately sought clarification of the position from the British authorities.</P>
    <P>They confirmed that they are aware of the potential disruption that this work could impose on traffic, especially at bank holiday weekends, and for this reason they deferred starting work until today, 5 May, so as to avoid disruption over the Northern bank holiday weekend <Col N="319" /> just gone by. I have been assured that the RUC will keep the public informed of any temporary diversions and will liaise with the Garda Síochána to ensure that drivers on both sides of the Border are kept aware of any re-routing while work proceeds. I understand also that extra police will be on duty at the checkpoints during the work to assist the flow of traffic.</P>
    <P>The Northern authorities have also indicated that while from time to time the Letterkenny and Muff checkpoints will have to be closed, one will always remain open. In addition, the checkpoint on the Buncrana road at Coshquin will not be affected and will remain open to traffic at all times.</P>
    <P>This would suggest that the disruption may not be as severe as many people first thought, but I fully appreciate that the closure of even one of the checkpoints for any period will inevitably cause some disruption. I will see to it that the situation is closely monitored over the coming weeks and I will continue to press the British authorities to make every effort to minimise the inconvenience to the local community.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Seán Ryan gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the future of the Kinsealy Research Centre, County Dublin, given the commitment by the previous Minister for Agriculture and Food that the centre would remain open, particularly given the implications for some 60 jobs and its importance in providing a research and advisory service to the horticultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue. On 4 March this year I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food in the Dáil if, in the light of his predecessor's meeting with the board of Teagasc, he would confirm that he had no proposals to close down or relocate the research centre at Kinsealy. In reply <Col N="320" /> he said that at a meeting that the research centres at Kinsealy and Belclare would remain open and that this situation had not changed.</P>
      <P>I raise the issue again tonight because I believe that the next three weeks will be critical for the future of Teagasc. Decisions will be made that will have major implications for the staff levels and the services provided to agricultural and horticultural industries throughout the country. I understand that it was stated at a recent Teagasc meeting, which the Minister attended, that the Teagasc debt of £10 million must be reduced within weeks and furthermore that centres must be closed. I also understand that the chairman stated that only four centres would be retained and that no reference was made to Kinsealy Research Centre. In the light of this, is it any wonder that I raise the issue this evening? I have no doubt that there is great concern for the staff in many of the other centres.</P>
      <P>If the Government proceed on this path they will breach the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which states:</P>
      <P>The Government will ensure that the necessary resources are provided to enable Teagasc to continue to provide an effective and integrated service covering education and training, advice and research.</P>
      <P>This clearly defines a special role for Teagasc and it also implies a positive Government response. A reduction in staff and the wholesale closure of centres is neither within the letter nor the spirit of that agreement. I condemn this approach by Government.</P>
      <P>The research institute was set up in Kinsealy in 1959 because of its proximity to the concentration of fresh vegetable growing on the east coast. This is just as relevant today, given that counties Dublin, Meath and Louth account for 33 per cent of the national fresh vegetable acreage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure or transfer of the research centre will put at risk up to 60 jobs in the greater Dublin area. While acknowledging the financial difficulties of the <Col N="321" /> board of Teagasc, they have taken the easy option and have risked the livelihoods of dedicated staff members and of many hundreds of people working in the industry. It is my firm belief that senior people on the board of Teagasc do not fully appreciate the employment potential in the horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>The five-year plan in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> involves the creation of about 1,000 full-time jobs to the end of 1993 and about 300 part time jobs annually in 1991, 1992 and 1993. This target will be put at risk by the Government's policy in relation to Teagasc.</P>
    <P>The continuation of the research unit at Kinsealy is vital to the development of the horticultural industry in Fingal. The importance of the education aspect cannot be stressed enough. The loss of the research and advisory service to the growers in north county Dublin will have a devastating effect, given the need to develop the mushroom, nursery stock and vegetable sections, all with great employment potential.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to confirm that Kinsealy will not be closed down or relocated. I also demand that the trade unions representing the staff be consulted regarding the package now being drawn up by the joint teams of the Department of Agriculture and Food and Teagasc and that the proposals be brought to the representatives of the staff prior to the Teagasc meeting on 28 May at Grange. This has major implications for this industry. Given Fianna Fáil's lipservice to the horticultural industry in the past, I would ask them to meet the commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and their commitments given prior to the last general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank Deputy Ryan. I have a deep interest in the proposed reorganisation of Teagasc as Johnstown Castle and Clonroche research centres are also part and parcel of that set-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Agriculture (Research, <Col N="322" /> Training and Advice) Act, 1988, establishing Teagasc the structure of the organisation is a matter for the Teagasc authority in the first instance, subject to the approval of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and, in certain respects, the Minister for Finance. The Teagasc authority have to date made no proposals to the Minister regarding the future of Kinsealy Research Centre or, indeed, the reorganisation of Teagasc generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister met the Teagasc authority on 24 April 1992. At the meeting the Minister reiterated the Government's commitment to the organisation, which was most recently demonstrated in the 1992 budget, when an additional £1 million was provided for Teagasc. The Minister stressed the need for Teagasc to provide their services in the most cost-effective and efficient way possible. It was agreed that a committee consisting of Teagasc management and senior officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food would be established to review the situation and to prepare a developmental and reorganisation plan for the organisation.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Ryan that the Government are totally committed to the continued development of the horticulture industry, particularly in view of its labour intensive nature. This commitment is evidenced by the setting up of An Bord Glas in 1990 and will be fully borne in mind by the committee which has been set up to chart the future structure of Teagasc.</P>
    <P>I also assure the Deputy that we will keep him informed as developments occur and when we get a report from that committee.</P>

      <P>Several farmers contacted me regarding the requirement that cattle must be punched before being sold if the owner is to qualify for a beef premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one instance the farmer had his calves stamped and punched in the local <Col N="323" /> veterinary office. He proceeded to sell the cattle at the local mart but at no time, either in the veterinary office or at the mart, was he informed that the cattle should also be punched. Later, following a spot inspection, he was refused payment of grants under the beef premium scheme because he was honest and admitted he had sold the cattle in question without having their ears punched. I consider this most unfair but it is typical of what is happening. In this case, the cattle in question would not have qualified for beef premium payments in the future because their calves, which accompanied them, were stamped and punched.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the Minister can answer me tonight, but I appeal to him to give consideration to the criteria necessary for qualification for the beef premium. The criteria should be changed to at least provide that to have calves stamped and punched is sufficient for qualification.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this question.</P>
      <P>Under the 1991 special beef premium scheme applicants were required to have the cattle identify cards of the male animals presented for premium notched and rubber-stamped by the staff of the local offices of my Department and to have the ears of those animals ear-punched with a 12 millimetre hole by the applicants themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1992 special beef premium scheme, however, while it is again proposed <Col N="324" /> to have the ears of the male cattle presented for premium ear-punched with a 12 millimetre hole by the applicants, it will no longer be necessary to have the cattle identity cards of those animals notched and rubber-stamped by the staff of my Department. This is one of the measures that, by relieving those staff of a very large block of work, will speed up payments in 1992 so as to ensure that all summer 1992 special beef premium applicants will be paid by the end of 1992 or within the calendar year.</P>
    <P>If, however, the cattle identity cards are not notched and rubber-stamped in future, the only way a farmer buying cattle for which premium has been paid will know that they have received premium and that he or she should not claim premium on those animals is by means of the holes punched in their ears by the 1992 applicants. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that such ear-punching continues for this reason. As I understand that over 10,000 ear-punching machines have been sold to the 90,000 or so applicants under this scheme, giving one punch for every nine farmers, and that ample time will be given to the applicants to do the ear-punching, I see no difficulty for farmers in meeting this requirement. Indeed, I urge them to ensure that they meet it in every case in 1992 so as to maintain their own entitlement to premium and to help other farmers apply for premium only on male cattle that have not received such premium already.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 6 May 1992.</P>

      <P>My Department cannot of course directly monitor the day to day operations at Sellafield. The actual quantities of radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea from Sellafield are determined by the operators of the plant. British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), by measuring the effluents before and during the discharges which must be within discharge limits authorised by the UK resulatory authorities who routinely carry out checks and inspections.</P>
      <P>BNFL, the U.K. Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Environment publish annually the quantities of radionuclides which have been discharged in the previous year from UK nuclear establishments. In the event of unauthorised or accidental discharges taking place, there is an agreement with the UK Department of the Environment whereby we are immediately notified.</P>
      <P>On the Irish side, environmental radioactivity monitoring is carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (formerly the Nuclear Energy Board) to determine the effects of these discharges on the Irish marine environment. The effects are quantified by the institute in some detail through their analyses of fish and shellfish collected at the principal fishing ports and of seaweeds, sediments and sea water from selected locations around the Irish coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation is that significant <Col N="37" /> reductions in radioactive effluents from Sellafield occurred during the early 1980's and since then there has been a further slow decline in contamination levels. Radiation doses to typical consumers of fish are now as low as 0.1 per cent of the International Commission for Radiological Protection annual dose limits for members of the public from controllable sources of radiation.</P>
    <P>While the principal objective of our monitoring programme is to obtain an estimate of the radiation exposure of the Irish public, it also enables us to detect unrecorded discharges, examine trends and generally relate the quantities reported as having been discharged with the Institute's monitoring results. This information has been regularly published in the form of reports from the Nuclear Energy Board from 1982 onwards which are available to the Deputy and the new Institute will continue this work.</P>
    <P>These reports contain a full description of the methodology used and I am fully satisfied that the effects of these discharges on the marine environment and on the Irish public are being properly measured by the Institute. I am also satisfied that the results obtained by the Institute are consistent with the discharges reported by BNFL and the UK authorities.</P>

    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute is carrying out a research programme on forestry on behalf of my Department on the socio-economic impact of forestry focusing on the impact <Col N="39" /> of forestry on rural communities; land mobility and change of use and land prices.</P>
    <P>The research programme commenced last November and is scheduled for completion later this year. The programme is being guided by a steering group representative of my Department, the Irish Timber Growers Association, Coillte Teoranta and the ESRI.</P>
    <P>The objectives of this work programme are: to study the extent to which forestry development can assist the economic development of rural communities; to describe and explain changes in full-time and part-time farming and associated land ownership patterns and to develop a framework for the collection of data on land prices in different regions and on different types of land.</P>
    <P>The nature and scope of these studies is such that virtually all of the issues mentioned by the Deputies, particularly the potential for job creation, will be assessed and I look forward to the receipt of the results of those studies at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In so far as the effect of forestry on the environment is concerned, the Deputies will be glad to note that it is a condition of grant-aid under the Forestry Operational Programme that forestry development must be compatible with the protection of the environment and, following consultations with the relevant Departments, procedures are already in place to ensure that environmental considerations are taken fully into account.</P>

      <P>In March this year, the EC Council reached agreement on proposals for the progressive reduction of the sulphur content of gasoils.</P>
      <P>The most significant aspect of the proposal relates to new standards for road diesel. By October, 1994, the maximum permitted sulphur content of road diesel will be 0.2 per cent. A sulphur content of 0.05 per cent will apply not later than October, 1996, but member states have committed to support its gradual availability before that date.</P>
      <P>The new standards will, of course, have considerable implications for European refining, including the refinery at Whitegate. At present Whitegate is producing gasoil and road diesel with a sulphur content of 0.13 per cent to 0.14 per cent, which is a lower level than that required under existing European standards of 0.2 per cent to 0.3 per cent, and is already meeting the October 1994 specification.</P>
      <P>The level of investment necessary to produce gasoil and diesel to the required 1996 specification would depend on a number of variables, including the availability and price of low sulphur crudes over the coming years and developments in the market for road diesel, both in Ireland and abroad. It is not possible at this stage to forecast these developments, or to estimate the timing of any investment and the costs which might arise for the refinery.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to achieve an upgrade of the refinery. In any such upgrade, it would be a requirement that the refinery be able to meet the higher environmental standards for petroleum products which will apply within the EC.</P>

      <P>While the percentage of electricity generated at present by wind power is insignificant, the wind farm development at Bellacorick, County Mayo currently under construction is expected to add approximately 17 Gigawatt-hours per annum to electricity supplies when it is completed later this year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this will be Ireland's first wind farm and the development of further prospects in this area will be determined by a variety of factors including the technical and financial performance of this project and developments which would reduce current high windfarm construction costs.</P>
      <P>The ESB has indicated that, in the Irish context the cost of generating electricity from wind power is approximately three times that of electricity generation using conventional methods. Presumably this cost differential will decrease with time due to a combination of maturing wind power technology and anticipated rising conventional costs as environmental constraints take effect.</P>

      <P>In 1991, only one exploration well was drilled offshore Ireland; an all-time low. I am determined to reverse the trend of decline in oil and gas exploration and to stimulate exploration activity. I have now taken action on petroleum taxation; new licensing terms will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The taxation measures in the Finance Bill contain elements which should work towards attracting exploration investment into Ireland. Most notably, the Bill provides for Corporation Tax at a rate of 25 per cent &mdash; with no production-related levy or higher tax rate &mdash; to apply where production of oil or gas takes place under petroleum leases which are issued before certain specified dates. In order to bring about the early drilling of wells the manner in which the availability of this tax rate is structured is such that greatest benefit can accrue to those companies which commit to exploration effort sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> Taken together, the enactment of petroleum taxation legislation and publication of new licensing terms will, for the first time, equip Ireland with a complete regime of fiscal and non-fiscal measures applicable to hydrocarbons exploration, development and production. I believe that these necessary steps will place Ireland in a strong position once again in relation to offshore exploration.</P>

      <P>In 1990 and 1991, Eolas carried out a sectoral audit programme, which was funded by my Department, by Eolas and by the EC under the Valoren Programme, which has now ended. This involved examining energy use in various sectors of the economy, by carrying out free energy audits of a representative sample of firms in a particular sector, and publicising the results of these studies through seminars, conferences, papers, etc. for all firms in that sector. Sectors examined included the bakeries, electronics, textiles and liquid milk sectors.</P>
      <P>The sectoral audit programme has now ended. However, this year Eolas, on behalf of my Department, will be promoting other activities which build on the experience gained from that programme. These activities include the promotion of self auditing and energy accounting in a number of private sector firms and the evaluation of the energy efficiency of rotating machinery used in industry such as air and refrigeration compressors, fans and pumps, etc.</P>
      <P>The ESB also has a programme of free electricity audit surveys in the industrial and commercial sectors.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to Council Directive 92/3/Euratom of 3 February, 1992 on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste between Member States and into and out of the Community. The Directive must be implemented in member states no later than 1 January, 1994 and requires that shipments of radioactive waste between member states and into and out of the Community must be subject to a system of prior authorisation. I can only welcome any Community measure which provides for the safe shipment of such waste so as to protect the workers involved and the environment in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impetus for this Directive arose from a European Parliament resolution in 1988 on the findings of a Committee of Inquiry into the Handling and Transport of Nuclear Materials. This resolution <Col N="47" /> called <i>inter alia</i> for comprehensive Community rules to make transfrontier movements of nuclear waste subject to a system of strict controls and authorisations from their point of origin to their point of storage. Ireland has consistently called for the implementation of all the other aspects of this resolution, including the revision of the Euratom Treaty to give the Community more comprehensive powers in the area of nuclear safety, as well as the full exercise of the inspection rights of the Commission which already exist under the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the available statistics on refunds of deposit interest retention tax do not distinguish between refunds made to approved charities, those made to individuals aged 65 or over and those made to incapacitated individuals. The total number of cases in which such refunds were made during 1991 was approximately 24,000; the vast bulk of these are likely to have been to individuals aged 65 years or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have introduced a series of measures to ensure that those entitled to claim refunds of deposit interest retention tax are aware of their entitlements and have the necessary claim forms. An extensive advertising campaign was undertaken in the press and on radio in April 1990 to draw attention to the circumstances in which an individual is entitled to a refund. As a result of this campaign there was an appreciable increase in the number of claims for refunds received in 1990 and 1991. Since the advertising campaign the Revenue Commissioners have maintained <Col N="98" /> a computerised record of all taxpayers who qualify for refunds and those taxpayers are automatically issued with claim forms in advance of the end of the year. A special simplified version of the claim form has been designed for those claimants who are on the Revenue records only for the purposes of deposit interest.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners are constantly monitoring the situation for new and innovative ways of targeting the over 65s and, for example, have recently redesigned their information leaflet on deposit interest retention tax to place greater emphasis on the categories of persons entitled to refunds and distributed this leaflet to all shows and seminars where the Commissioners have a presence, including an &ldquo;Active Age Week&rdquo; in a Dublin Department store. With the enactment of the proposed changes in deposit interest retention tax provided for in the Finance Bill, 1992, consideration will be given by the Commissioners to the need for additional publicity.</P>
    <P>As far as advice by financial institutions to their clients is concerned, that is a matter for these institutions themselves. The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the present system is working satisfactorily. In these circumstances I have no plans to introduce any changes along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The completion of the Single European Market on 1 January 1993 will create a large surplus staff situation in the Customs and Excise Service. The Revenue Commissioners have acknowledged that the Donegal area along with a number of other areas such as Dundalk and Wexford will be particularly badly affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced that the Government <Col N="99" /> has decided to assign to Revenue two important areas of new work arising from the Single Market and that these would be administered from two new decentralised revenue offices in Dundalk and Wexford. The first area of new work relates to the collection of EC trade statistics post-1992 and the new VAT information system. This work will be administered from Dundalk. The second area of new work relates to motor vehicle registration tax and this will be administered from Rosslare initially pending the building of new decentralised Government offices in Wexford.</P>
    <P>The new areas of work as well as providing administrative type jobs in Dundalk and Wexford will also support the equivalent of about 130 jobs throughout the country on work related to compliance and enforcement. The Donegal area will received a proportion of these jobs. The following options to address the Customs and Excise surplus staff situation are also being actively pursued; negotiation with relevant unions to absorb surplus staff in other areas of Revenue and to involve the Customs and Excise service in the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes an detection of evasion and avoidance; opening of redeployment opportunities in other Departments such as Agriculture, Marine and Justice; allowing Customs and Excise staff into the decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that these options will also help to reduce the surplus staff situation in Donegal. However, the Revenue Commissioners recognise that the scope for redeployment in the context of the measures outlined would not be capable on their own of solving the surplus staff situation in Donegal. The Commissioners are actively seeking solutions to this problem with the aim of ensuring that, to the greatest extent possible, a career can be provided for all Donegal based Customs and Excise staff in, or close to, their present locations.</P>

      <P>The basic framework governing financial assistance for the purchase of new fishing vessels is laid down in EC Regulations Nos. 4028/86 and 3944/90.</P>
      <P>Within this framework and subject to a minimum national grant of 5 per cent, grants of up to 35 per cent may be available from the Community. However, the payment of such grants is subject to compliance by the member state with fleet targets laid down by the Commission. Generally speaking, the Commission has not approved in recent years any grants for constructions. Moreover, in current circumstances there would appear to be little prospect that such grants will be approved for Ireland in the short to medium term.</P>
      <P>BIM may provide loans for the purchase of new boats. However, the limitation on the finance available from the Exchequer and the need to give greater priority to other programmes such as boat modernisations, often results in loans being sought from other lending institutions.</P>

      <P>The Garda District Headquarters station in Drogheda is in poor condition and is not adequate to meet the long term needs of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>A site purchased by the Office of Public Works for a new Garda station at this centre was subsequently found to be of archaeological interest. In view of the implications which this would have for cost, the possible availability of suitable alternative sites in the town is being pursued. Two sites have already been inspected but were found to be unsuitable. The Office of Public Works have been asked to identify, as a matter of urgency, any other sites that may be available.</P>

      <P>The allocation and transfer of Garda officers is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. Neither my Department nor I have any function in this respect. Invariably, Garda officers are informed by their authorities of their allocation or transfer prior to any public announcement and all their circumstances, including those of family, are taken into account before the decision to transfer them is taken. In a disciplined organisation with national responsibilities transfers are a necessary element in day to day administration.</P>
      <P>Most Garda transfers actually arise as a consequence of retirements and promotions but lateral moves are also made from time to time to meet the objectives of Garda management in ensuring effective law enforcement throughout the jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Where an officer is opposed to being transferred he or she may appeal the transfer order and formal machinery is in place to deal with any such appeal.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities report that there is a Garda assigned to Taughmaconnell Garda station on a permanent basis. The officer in question has been working in the district for some time and resides approximately six miles from the station. The accommodation at the station became vacant earlier this year and I am informed by the Garda authorities that, unfortunately, in this case no Garda from the Roscommon/Galway East Division or neighbouring Divisions is interested in occupying the accommodation at Taughmaconnell at present. It is the policy of the Garda authorities to encourage members to reside in the areas in which they are stationed. However, the Garda Commissioner cannot compel a member to do so.</P>

    <P>Taughmaconnell sub-District forms <Col N="107" /> part of the community policing initiative for rural areas which was introduced last September. The station is open for two hours each day and is patrolled regularly by mobile units from Ballinasloe. The Garda authorities are satisfied that the current policing arrangements are adequate to meet the policing requirements for Taughmaconnell. They inform me that there were a total of 14 crimes reported in the Taughmaconnell sub-District over the past three years which, without being complacent, is a very low figure.</P>

      <P>The school in question is a voluntary secondary school. Intake policy into such a school is primarily a matter for school management, subject to acceptable criteria being applied. It would be expected that priority would be given to pupils who are resident in and attend primary schools within the school's own area.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is pressure on post-primary places for both boys and girls in the Navan Road/Cabra area of Dublin at present. I am satisfied, however, that the decision to build a new post-primary school in Hartstown, starting with provision for 100 pupils next September, to be followed by a new school in Dunboyne, will greatly ease the situation in that general area, including Navan Road/Cabra.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the question of providing additional accommodation at the school in question should not arise at this stage. My Department will however, continue to keep under review the post primary accommodation needs of the general area.</P>
      <P>It is understood that an intake of 132 pupils is planned for the forthcoming school year. Over 50 per cent of these pupils are from the Navan Road/Cabra area. The remainder are from the adjacent areas, mainly Castleknock, Blanchardstown, Laurel Lodge and from the Dunboyne area of County Meath. Similar data in relation to future years is not readily available.</P>

      <P>I assume that when the Deputy states that the person in question does not qualify for any higher education grants because he has not been 18 months unemployed he is referring to the pilot scheme which is operated by the Department of Social Welfare. Under this scheme persons who are aged 23 years or over and are on the long term rate of unemployment assistance may retain their entitlements if they attend a full-time under-graduate third level course in an approved institution.</P>
      <P>In so far as the higher education grants scheme coming under the aegis of my Department is concerned Dublin Corporation, the body statutorily entrusted with its administration in this case, has no record of an application for a higher education grant from the person in question.</P>
      <P>I have recently set up a working group in my Department to review the criteria for the award of third level grants with a view to achieving greater equity and transparency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under improvements being introduced in the 1992 higher education grants scheme and related schemes for new entrants to third level education, mature students who secure a place on a third level course will meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant <Col N="110" /> and may be assessed on the basis of their own income (and, if married, their spouse's incomes) rather than on their parents' income which has been the case up to now.</P>

      <P>In addition to the normal provisions of company law, all State bodies under the aegis of my Department, including the CIE group, have specific requirements regarding the conduct of directors, including procedures to prevent board members from being <Col N="114" /> involved in decisions where a conflict with their personal interests might arise.</P>
      <P>I understand that, under the code of conduct in operation in CIE, it is the duty of the chairman of the CIE board and the chairman of each subsidiary company to ensure that a conflict of interest, where it arises, is recorded in the minutes of the meeting and that the member or director by whom the disclosure is made is not permitted to take any part in the deliberations or decisions of the board or company with respect to the matter.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, all the State companies are required to abide by the Government's guidelines for State bodies published last March which also include specific procedures for disclosure of interests by members of boards.</P>
      <P>Under these guidelines, each State company is required to adopt a formal code of conduct for directors, which includes an obligation on board members to furnish to the company secretary, <i>inter alia</i>, details of employment and other business interests, including family interests or those of any other person or body connected with the member, which could involve a continuing conflict of interest. The company secretary must keep an updated record of such details and is not to make available to any member documents relating to company dealings involving their recorded interests or the interests of a competitor. Members are also required to absent themselves when the board is deliberating on matters on which there could be a conflict of interest.</P>

      <P>At present, data in respect of HIV in Ireland is based on the number of tests which have been confirmed as positive by the virus reference laboratory, UCD. This monitoring shows that almost 1,200 samples have tested positive for the virus. I accept that this figure does not represent the full picture regarding the level of HIV infection present in the population but is useful as an indicator of trends in the progression of the infection, in particular amongst specific groups of the population and as a basis for the planning of programmes and services in this area. The data is based on voluntary testing and is anonymous and does not, therefore, indicate the area in which the individuals reside. I am concerned, however that more precise data is available in relation to the infection and towards providing this, the sub-committee of the National IDS Strategy Committee will be making recommendations to me on, <i>inter alia</i>, a mechanism to monitor HIV on a regional, as well as on a national basis. I would accept, however, that the majority of infected persons reside in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I <Col N="116" /> announced recently that an additional £2 million approximately will be spent during the current year on services for AIDS/HIV and illicit drug use in the Dublin area. This will supplement the State funding already provided to services in the city area of Dublin provided by the Eastern Health Board and the voluntary sector. As regards the medical services currently available to HIV sufferers in the north inner city, these are largely provided by the Drug Treatment Centre at Trinity Court, Beaumont Hospital, the AIDS Resource Centre in Baggot Street and at St. James's Hospital. I am aware that persons from the area who require these services have to travel outside the area to avail of them and I have taken steps to ensure that appropriate medical services are available within the area. These steps include the putting in place of a consultant-led Infectious Disease Service for AIDS/HIV at the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals. The process for filling the consultant post has commenced and I expect the service to be operational in the near future.</P>

      <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the <Col N="117" /> chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>In view of the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers to issue medical cards, I am satisfied that no one is denied essential health services due to inability to pay. In these circumstances it would not be justifiable to extend the medical card scheme to a specific group without any regard to their means.</P>

      <P>The long term illness scheme is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Persons with conditions such as Alzheimers who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses, without undue hardship, may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all drugs and medicines without charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any other person with an ongoing medical condition, such as Alzheimers, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the drug cost subsidisation scheme. This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries, on prescribed medicines, to £32 per month. This scheme is being availed of by over 20,000 persons and the take-up <Col N="123" /> in the scheme emphasises the benefits of the scheme for persons with a long term drug requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The recognition of the problem posed by Alzheimers disease/dementia is a relatively recent development. There is no hard information on the numbers of persons affected by dementia in the country. The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> estimated that by the end of this decade there would be 20,000 persons suffering from the disease, of which a much smaller number would be severely affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health I recognise that carers of Alzheimer's sufferers provide an invaluable service to the community. <i>The Years Ahead</i> is the first official report to recommend comprehensive measures to assist their carers. The recommendations of <i>The Years Ahead</i> have been accepted by Government as policy towards the elderly. Considerable progress has been made in implementing the recommendations of this report. An additional £9 million has been made available in the past three years to expand services for the elderly, particularly in the area of <Col N="124" /> community care. One of the features was an extension of the respite programme which would have been of considerable advantage to carers. The development of the community care scheme in all health board areas is providing intensive support to dependent elderly people at home and their carers. The expansion of the home nursing and home help services to provide night and weekend cover in most health boards is of great benefit to the elderly and their carers. Finally, the provision of more day care places and respite care beds offers a break from caring during the day or for short and regular periods of time.</P>
    <P>I am also very supportive of the effort by the Soroptimists International to highlight the role of carers by publishing a Carer's Charter. My Department has written to each chief executive officer of the health boards enclosing a copy of the Carer's Charter prepared by the Soroptimists last year. Each health board has been asked to consider the charter in the preparation of plans to develop community services for the elderly and also the mentally and physically handicapped and the mentally ill. I will be examining these plans to ensure that the needs of carers are identified and services designed to take account of them.</P>

      <P>A post of consultant orthodontist has been approved by my Department for each health board. Following improvements made by my Department in the salary and conditions of service attached to the post which make the post more attractive a number of health boards have now been successful in filling these posts through the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> Health boards which have not yet been successful in making appointments are arranging to have the vacancies re-advertised or have made (or are making) alternative arrangements to provide consultant cover for the orthodontic services provided.</P>
    <P>For the past few years my Department has provided additional funds to health boards specifically for the development of orthodontic services and this has resulted in a significant improvement in the services. The successful recruitment of consultants will further improve services.</P>

      <P>Grading structures which currently apply to the discipline of physiotherapy, whether in community care or hospital settings, are as determined by the findings of an expert working party which reported in July 1978.</P>
      <P>The creation of senior posts is justified either in terms of the total number of physiotherapists employed, or alternatively, a senior grading may be justified in particular circumstances where a practitioner is working single-handed in a specialised area demanding a higher degree of responsibility and skill.</P>
      <P>There is no basis for the upgrading of posts merely on grounds of location in a community care setting as opposed to a hospital.</P>

      <Quest>if a person (details supplied) in Dublin, who is receiving a deserted wife's allowance for herself and one dependent child totalling £68 per week, would be better off if she was receiving a disabled person's maintenance allowance, which she now understands she would be entitled to; and if he will give details of the amount of the payment she would be entitled to under the DPMA scheme.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned is entitled to deserted wife's benefit of £73.80 per week. This consists of the maximum personal rate for herself and one dependent child. This payment is being reduced by £5 per week in repayment of an overpayment of deserted wife's benefit which arose during the years 1985-88. She is, therefore, receiving £68.80 per week.</P>
      <P>The local health board decides on entitlement to disabled person's maintenance allowance which is awarded on both means test and medical grounds. If the person concerned qualified for this allowance, she would receive a maximum rate of £67 per week. This is £1.80 per week lower than her current rate of payment. She would be likely to also qualify for free electricity allowance, a free TV licence and a free travel pass. However, she would also continue to have a liability to my Department in respect of her overpayment of deserted wife's benefit.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline his proposals in relation to the very real hardship which his Department imposes on old age pension adult dependants whose spouses are in long term care where the spouse's income, such as in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 from such a pension goes totally towards payment of this care but yet his Department insists on assessing the means of the adult dependant as being half the means of the married couple, and not allowing the adult dependant's means to be treated separately and also insisting that splitting the pension and the adult dependant allowance by way of separate payment is only allowed where the marriage tie is broken even though for practical purposes the couple are living apart; if he will introduce legislation to allow, (1) separate payments to be made in cases where spouses are in long term care, (2) adult dependants to claim for free schemes in their own right in such cases and (3) adult dependants to claim for old age non-contributory pension based on their own income alone; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The claimant concerned is in receipt of an old age (contributory) pension including an adult dependant allowance for his wife. The couple have requested the separate payment arrangement and the claimant receives the personal rate of payment and the spouse the adult dependant increase. The spouse has claimed the old age (non-contributory) pension in her own right but the rate she would be awarded is less than the rate she currently receives as an adult dependant on her husband's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The reason for this is that half of the husband's occupational pension is assessed against her as means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation in relation to old age pensions specifically provides that in assessing the means of a married applicant for a pension, the means of the applicant and his spouse are jointly assessed. Half the means thus assessed are then attributed to the applicant and half to his spouse. <Col N="140" /> In cases such as the one to which the Deputy refers the couple are treated as living together as the marriage tie is not broken. I recognise that the present arrangements may give rise to anomalies in certain cases and I am having these reviewed in the context of a review of means tests generally within the Department.</P>
    <P>Title to payment under the various social insurance and assistance schemes is vested in the person who meets the statutory conditions relating to such schemes. While supplements in respect of a claimant's spouse and children are incorporated into the various schemes, they do not have direct title to these payments. Where the circumstances warrant, the spouse can receive, on behalf of the claiming spouse, half the combined sum of the personal rate of payment and the adult dependant increase. Where the couple are living apart the spouse receives the adult dependant allowance.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for entitlement to the free schemes, excluding free travel, the claimant must normally be in receipt of a qualifying payment. Depending on the circumstances of a case, the question of recognising the entitlement of a dependant is considered on its merits and does not give rise to any need for new legislation. In the particular case cited, the dependant is currently receiving the free benefits and no reason is seen why she should not continue to do so.</P>

      <P>Preservation of benefits under the Pensions Act only applies to pensionable service after 1 January 1991. Under the provisions of Part III of the Act, employees who leave a scheme before normal pension age and who have five years membership of the scheme, of which at least two years is after 1 January 1991, are entitled to have benefits in respect of service from 1 January, 1991 preserved within the scheme. Alternatively, they may opt to have the actuarial value of the benefit transferred to the scheme of their new employer or to a life office annuity contract.</P>
      <P>However these provisions do not affect pre-1991 service. The member's entitlement in respect of such service is governed by the rules of the particular scheme involved.</P>
      <P>In relation to State and semi-State pension schemes generally, a transfer network operates within these schemes which allows persons moving between such schemes to have their pension rights transferred. Most schemes within the State and semi-State sectors also allow for the preservation of benefits where a person moves from such employment to take up a position in the private sector.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board have been asked to examine the issue of having preservation of benefits requirements apply to periods of service before 1 January, 1991 with a view to encouraging employers to provide for preservation in respect of past service rights, where this is the wish of members. At this stage I do not envisage such preservation becoming mandatory either for employers or for members, a number of whom wish to retain the option of obtaining refunds of contributions in respect of pre-1991 service.</P>
      <P>The matter will be considered further when the Pensions Board have completed their examination of the issue.</P>

      <P>The Commission of the European Community has designated the period March 1992 to March 1993 as the &ldquo;European Year of Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work&rdquo;. The main objectives of the Year are to raise awareness among workers and employers about hazards in the workplace and the appropriate ways of combating them. The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, which is responsible for the administration and enforcement of health and <Col N="144" /> safety at work under the aegis of the Department of Labour is co-ordinating events for the Year in this country.</P>
      <P>The authority has established a national liaison committee which is representative of a broad range of interests, including the social partners, to co-ordinate the activities for the Year. This committee has decided to highlight specific topics throughout the Year including farming and forestry, chemical safety, construction and manual handling of loads. The activities for the Year were launched in conjunction with a two day seminar on occupational safety and health in Dublin Castle on 20-21 March 1992.</P>
      <P>As part of its support for the European Year the European Commission approved an indicative budget for each member state for &ldquo;co-funded&rdquo; national activities promoting the objectives of the Year. Ireland's share of this budget amounts to approximately £160,000 in 1992 with a possibility of further funding in 1993.</P>
