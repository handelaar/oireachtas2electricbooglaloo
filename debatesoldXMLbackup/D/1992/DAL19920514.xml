      <P>I seek your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to move the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to raise the most urgent and serious dispute in An Post &mdash; which has been worsened by the breakdown in talks yeaterday &mdash; and to investigate all the means possible whereby this dispute will be resolved.</P>

      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by Standing Order 30. Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion. As the House is aware the Deputy had this matter debated on the Adjournment last night when the latest developments on this ongoing dispute were well known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is particularly appropriate to take the Labour Estimate today in view of the fact that we are experiencing the worst period of industrial unrest for many years? Does he recall the circumstances and the background to his own appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1979 and the industrial unrest during that period, including the postal strike&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir. I wish to ask the Taoiseach, bearing in mind the background to his own appointment in 1979 as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, whether the Government have any plans to amend the Post and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek clarification from the Taoiseach in relation to the long-promised and long-awaited Green Paper on Education. Despite the promises that there would be an education debate and that the Green Paper would be published early in the year &mdash; in fact, it was to be published last year but because of various changes the publication was delayed &mdash; neither of those things has happened. What are the intentions of the present Minister? Will a Green Paper be published? Will the Minister circulate even his introduction to the Green Paper, which he released in a blaze of publicity during the week after Easter? Does he intend to circulate Deputies with those documents?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the fact that talks between An Post and the unions have now come to a standstill, does the Taoiseach propose to take any steps to intervene? In particular, does he intend to ask the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to stop making statements that exacerbate the difficulties?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you may find that the issue is not relevant to the Standing Orders but it is relevant to tens of thousands of people outside the House. It is time the Government got off their hands and did something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach at what stage of preparation is the Health Insurance Bill at present. Further, will that legislation provide for the systematic expropriation of funds from HIV members in the way that that was done in amendment No. 151 of the Finance Bill &mdash; an underhand fashion without any proper notice to or consultation with the House?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> That a sum not exceeding £157,474,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1992, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The central purposes of my Department are threefold: to promote better employment standards while protecting the basic rights of workers; to promote efficiency and fairness in the labour market and to help eliminate disadvantage; and to promote good industrial relations and to ensure that the skills our economy needs are available, thereby facilitating job creation and job maintenance.</P>
    <P>To achieve these goals my Department have adopted the approach of separating the responsibilities for policy development from the responsibilities for their execution. In recent years my Department have set up three separate agencies &mdash; FÁS, the Health and Safety Authority and the Labour Relations Commission. FÁS take responsibility for day-to-day management of all manpower programmes. The Health and Safety Authority take responsibility for administration of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and for the implementation of its underlying principles. The primary role in developing industrial relations policy, administering the law and overseeing the collective bargaining structures in this country rests with my Department. In 1990, the most fundamental review of trade dispute law since 1906 came to fruition with the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act. Responsibility for day-to-day promotion of good industrial relations lies with the new Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>The Department's responsibility in promoting better employment standards while protecting the basic rights of workers is enhanced by the charter of fundamental social rights of workers which was adopted by Ireland and ten <Col N="1467" /> other member states of the European Community in 1989. The EC Commission action programme to implement the charter includes some twenty legally binding instruments as well as a range of other measures. In the last year, the Social Affairs Council have been giving consideration to the Commission's proposals relating to non-typical workers &mdash; such as part-time, temporary and agency workers &mdash; the organisation of working time, the protection of pregnant women at work and women who have recently given birth, and the provision of information to employees about their conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>The Government fully recognise the need to develop the social dimension of Community policies. It is a vital complement to the emphasis on the economic dimension. We see social cohesion as an essential basis for the creation of the Single Market and for sustainable economic integration generally.</P>
    <P>As always, an important aim is to ensure that specific community actions in this broad area are satisfactorily adjusted to Ireland's distinctive circumstances and needs, particularly our need to maintain and increase the numbers in viable employment.</P>
    <P>At the most recent meeting of the Council for Social Affairs Ministers, which was held in Luxembourg on 30 April last, there was a lengthy discussion on the consideration of the proposed Directive on the Organisation of Working Time. Our approach to the working time directive is that it should be sufficiently flexible to take account of the many and varied patterns of work in modern industry and that it should avoid any adverse affects on employment and jobs.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of this more flexible outcome, I argued for a longer reference period over which the 48-hour working week would be averaged. I am glad to say that I got an encouraging degree of support on this. When the Social Affairs Ministers meet again in June, I am optimistic that we can find a compromise which will suit all 12 member states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> At that Council we also considered two other Commission proposals for directives. The Council adopted a common position on a proposal for a directive concerning the health and safety of workers in extractive industries. This will now proceed to the European Parliament. The proposal for a new directive on collective redundancies was adopted by the Council on the basis of unanimity. I welcome the progress made in both of these instruments.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority which was established under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is now two years in existence. During 1991 they continued to develop their role as the body charged with overall responsibility for the day-to-day administration and enforcement of the new occupational safety and health system. This new system is a radical replacement for its precursor in that, under the 1989 legislation, protection was extended from approximately 20 per cent of the workforce in the &ldquo;traditional sectors&rdquo; such as manufacturing, industry, mining and construction, to include all places of work. The Health and Safety Authority are implementing a comprehensive three-year programme of work at present.</P>
    <P>Significant progress was made during 1991 on a number of important European Community Occupational Safety and Health Directives. In that year seven further directives were transposed into Irish law.</P>
    <P>1992 has been designated by the EC as European Year of Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work. The main objectives of the year are to raise awareness among workers and employers about hazards in the workplace and the appropriate ways of combating them. The Health and Safety Authority are co-ordinating a wide variety of activities and events for the year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the toll in human suffering, the annual cost to this country of occupational accidents and diseases, including employers' liability insurance, social insurance and health service costs, is around £300 million. The various <Col N="1469" /> indirect costs which also arise including work days lost, lost production, loss of orders and so forth, are difficult to assess and quantify but, all told, these costs are an additional burden on our economy and competitiveness. Any savings which we could generate through reduced levels of accidents and ill-health at work, would be far better deployed towards creating badly needed jobs.</P>
    <P>One of the most important issues in terms of economic performance and one over which we ourselves have control is the industrial relations environment. Nothing can be more damaging to investor confidence than the perception of unreliability and uncertainty which is generated by highly publicised incidents of industrial relations unrest. The consensus-based approach of both the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has facilitated a significant improvement in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the pay agreements associated with both programmes have benefited all parties involved. They have provided workers with real increases in take-home pay and at the same time allowed employers to plan ahead with a considerable degree of certainty as to wage costs. With industrial relations and wage cost stability, firms have been able to concentrate on competing in their respective markets and this has contributed greatly to our good performance on the export front.</P>
    <P>While our industrial relations climate has been very good in recent years there are signs of increasing levels of industrial unrest in some employments. The recent dispute in the four associated banks is, of course, the most obvious example.</P>
    <P>The present postal dispute, could hardly have come at a worse time, a time when we should be preparing for the competitive challenges which are ahead. I regret that the talks with the Labour Relations Commission have not to date succeeded in reaching a settlement. As indicated, the Government are not prepared to subsidise a loss-making company and if An Post are to become profitable, changes must be made. I <Col N="1470" /> would therefore ask all the parties to make further efforts to see how this can be best achieved. My information is that progress was made at the talks at the Labour Relations Commission. The commission remain available to the parties.</P>
    <P>The most recent dispute statistics available to me present evidence of the increasing level of strike activity. In the first three months of this year 52,000 days were lost due to industrial disputes compared with 10,000 and 25,000 respectivbely in the same reference period in 1991 and 1990. While this is an improvement on most years in the seventies and early eighties I am concerned that this trend should not continue as it would undermine the whole consensus approach adopted since 1987 and would, of course, be totally at odds with the objectives of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and its forerunner, the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> We have enjoyed a remarkable record over the past number of years in terms of strike activity and days lost and it would, to say the least, be unfortunate if that achievement were to be lost.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am pleased to record that funds have been secured this year to enable the necessary staff to be appointed to the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission. The commission have recently appointed a director of this service and are in the process of getting the service off the ground. I look forward to the successful operation of the advisory service. I am anxious that it should play a significant role in the industrial relations arena assisting both unions and managements in dealing with what may sometimes seem like intractable difficulties.</P>
    <P>In their first year of operation the Labour Relations Commission have been very active and successful in the prevention and resolution of disputes. In 1991 over 1,800 disputes were handled by the conciliation service and a settlement rate of 86 per cent was achieved. This compares with an average settlement rate of about 60 per cent in preceding years. There has been a corresponding drop in <Col N="1471" /> the proportion of disputes being referred to the Labour Court for investigation.</P>
    <P>While it is likely that claims under the local bargaining clause of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will inevitably lead to some increase in the workload of the conciliation service, employers and unions should make every effort to reach settlements at local level without resort to third parties. This would be in keeping with the central principle underlying our approach to industrial relations, that of free collective bargaining between the parties whereby they work out their own solutions.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in the expertise and professionalism of the Commission, but there must be a realisation that their involvement cannot bring about magical solutions to industrial difficulties. At the end of the day it must be for the parties themselves to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions to their problems. In addition, too great a reliance on the State machinery will place very severe demands on the capacity of the machinery to respond quickly and could lead to unnecessary delays and frustration.</P>
    <P>The code of practice on dispute procedures including procedures in essential services is the first code to be drawn up under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990. It provides a set of procedures which enables the issues involved in a dispute to be processed without the need for recourse to industrial action. The code has the advantage of providing comprehensive and reasonable procedures without being over-prescriptive and can be adapted for use in all employments. Its success ultimately depends on the commitment of unions and employers to making it work. My Department and the Labour Relations Commission have ensured that the code has been widely circulated and will continue to encourage and monitor the implementation of dispute procedures as provided for in the code.</P>
    <P>The experience with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>  and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i><Col N="1472" /> has demonstrated what can be achieved when all the main social partners come together and are involved in the drawing up of a range of agreed targets and objectives. The success of this approach, based on consensus rather than adversarial attitudes, sets a clear example as to what could be achieved by the adoption of participative arrangements at the level of the industrial enterprise. Indeed, there is evidence of a move away from the traditional adversarial style of industrial relations to a more consensus-based approach. This trend derives from a recognition that it is in everyone's interest that enterprises be developed to achieve their maximum potential.</P>
    <P>Last June saw the launch of the FIE-ICTU joint declaration on employee involvement in the private sector, drawn up under the auspices of the Employer-Labour Conference. I welcome the clear commitment by the FIE and the ICTU in the declaration to the concept and practice of employee involvement. I believe that the provisions of the document should form the basis on which employee involvement in enterprises can be encouraged and developed.</P>
    <P>Low pay has been highlighted as an issue which needs particular attention. The Government have been seeking to address it in ways which are in keeping with our system of pay determination. For example, the pay agreements associated with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are weighted in favour of those on low pay, providing for minimum flat increases to be negotiated and agreed. There are other Government supports for those on low pay, including the family income supplement and, of course, the radical overhaul of the taxation system which is being progressively implemented and provides very positive evidence of the Government's intentions in this overall area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Joint Labour Committee, established last year for the retail, grocery and allied trades, greatly extends the scope of the system. It brings an additional estimated 25,000 workers under the protection of the system compared <Col N="1473" /> with 40,000 prior to its coming into existence. The committee recently submitted proposals to the Labour Court for setting minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for the workers concerned. Once the court gives effect to these proposals by making an employment regulation order they will become legally binding on all the employers in the retail grocery sector to whom the order relates.</P>
    <P>In the period 1989 to 1993 Ireland will have received over £1 billion from the European Social Fund. When matched by Exchequer funds this amounts to an investment of nearly £2 billion in co-financed training and employment programmes. These funds have been applied to the provision of training for a range of economic sectors &mdash; industry and services, tourism, training of foresters, farmers and fishermen, rural development and for the upgrading of the skills of the trainers themselves. We can anticipate a significantly increased allocation in the post-1993 period. The European Commission has indicated the possible extension of Structural Funds aid to new areas in the education and health sectors. In the forthcoming negotiations I will seek to ensure an outcome that takes the fullest account of our national priorities.</P>
    <P>In the future, the skills differential which exists between Ireland and the most economically advanced member states of the Community will have to be bridged. This requires a fundamental change in the attitude of employers to the importance of training if trading competitiveness is to be achieved and maintained. Certification of standards achieved is an essential part of this process. I am pleased that a realisation of this fact is increasingly a part of our training activity.</P>
    <P>The European Commission no longer contributes to spending on the social employment scheme. As a consequence, the Exchequer has this year to fully fund the social employment scheme at a total cost of almost £73 million. This scheme is exclusively aimed at those long term unemployed people over 25 years of age. It allows for part-time employment on <Col N="1474" /> improvement schemes which deliver amenity or environmental benefits to local communities throughout the country. Participation in the scheme should assist in the rehabilitation into working life of those who have suffered from long spells of unemployment and improve their chances of getting work. I know that this scheme is generally valued and does confer benefits.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to have it reinstated for assistance from Social Fund post-1993. I will be making a very strong case with that objective in mind. It is clear that programmes such as the social employment scheme cannot be assessed exclusively by reference to economic criteria. Accordingly, my concern is to have a clearer view on the economic and social objectives of training and employment programmes to be assisted under the Community Support Framework for Ireland in the years 1994 to 1997.</P>
    <P>Demographic considerations continue to render the employment problem more acute here in Ireland than elsewhere. However, the growth in unemployment throughout the world, even in the most industrialised countries, is now a growing cause of concern to all. As the House is aware, the All-Party Committee on Employment have just begun their work under the chairmanship of Deputy Brian Hillery. Their brief is to examine all aspects of the employment problem. It is my hope that the work of that committee will play a crucial role in formulating policies for the future which will allow us to address the problem of unemployment, the most serious problem we face as a nation.</P>
    <P>I intend addressing the main policy issues relating to the labour market and manpower policy in a White Paper which will be published later this year &mdash; training, apprenticeships, European Social Fund intervention, certification, employment schemes and so on. In particular I intend to see that the recommendations of the Culliton report on the training of the employed are implemented. In particular, this will mean the establishment within FÁS of a separate division <Col N="1475" /> with special responsibility for training and employment.</P>
    <P>The target of 15,000 persons being recruited from the live register for the employment subsidy scheme recently announced is ambitious. I am still optimistic that with the co-operation of the social partners the target is achievable. Up to last Friday, 8 May 1992, 2,482 jobs had been approved under the scheme.</P>
    <P>In view of the current level of registered unemployment I might take this opportunity to strongly urge employers to take advantage of the subsidy of £54 per week for 52 weeks, giving a total of £2,808 under the scheme, and take on additional workers. I recently amended the conditions of the scheme to render it as attractive as possible to employers.</P>
    <P>The job training scheme, which is also targeted at persons on the live register, is a scheme providing opportunities on employers premises for work-based training. Such a scheme is a departure from the practice to date of providing training for unemployed people in training centres. The scheme has tremendous potential but the potential can only be realised with the co-operation of employers and trade unions. I appeal again to the social partners to take advantage of the assistance available from the EC towards the training allowance costs of persons taken on under the scheme. I expect that the first recruits will be taken on in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>A well-trained workforce is a key element in the competitiveness of industry and business generally. This year's budget allocation for FÁS is £245.39 million and last year they had a total through-put of trainees amounting to 28,848. That figure does not include all those who were engaged in employment schemes.</P>
    <P>In the past our training system has tended to be based on a British model. However, as we have widened our European horizons, other national models have come to our attention, including that of Germany and Switzerland. Whereas in Ireland we have 30 designated trades the German apprenticeship system covers almost 370 <Col N="1476" /> different trades. Furthermore, the German system is characterised by employer funding and the chamber of commerce administering the system. In the future I intend to take a closer look at the training systems which operate elsewhere in Europe with a view to considering their best features in an Irish context.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for a revised apprenticeship system were agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Funding arrangements have now been agreed for a 0.25 per cent levy on employers. In particular, we must now widen the number of occupations covered by the apprenticeship system.</P>
    <P>It is important for the future that certification of vocational qualifications be such that they will be recognised as representing attained skill levels both at home and abroad. Standard based training certification is an extremely important and urgent matter. I intend to give the matter priority. Our view is that we need a new authoritative independent national certification body. I intend to have consultations with the Minister for Education about this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>The tourism sector continues to offer strong potential for employment creation and income generation. The Government's job creation targets for the tourism industry are likely to be achieved, The industry now accounting for one in every fourteen jobs in Ireland. A recent study of the Irish tourism industry carried out by CERT has highlighted great diversity emerging in the make-up of the non-traditional areas of the hotel and catering industry.</P>
    <P>Activity and cultural holidays in particular have shown rapid growth. CERT is actively involved in addressing the training needs of these newer sectors of the Irish tourism industry. In total CERT plan to train almost 9,000 people in 1992, thereby continuing the provision of skilled personnel for the industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the picture overall is, one of steady progress in the various areas of my Department's work &mdash; in industrial relations, safety, training and employment <Col N="1477" /> schemes and labour legislation. As a nation employment creation remains our major challenge. It is my hope that the good relations this Government have maintained over many years with the social partners will continue to flourish and that we will take each other's interests into account in future negotiations on a wide range of matters.</P>
    <P>The spirit of consensus which this Government have successfully built up should not be thrown away. Certainly it is my hope that it shall not be.</P>

      <P>While the Minister's speech may have been an excellent historical account of the responsibilities and duties of the Department of Labour, I did not detect anything positive in it which would give hope to those people who depend on his Department and the Government to solve the unemployment problem. It is amazing that so little of the Minister's speech was devoted to the major crisis facing us today, that is, unemployment. We are discussing this Estimate today in the knowledge that approximately 281,000 people are unemployed. This is an appalling human tragedy; it is an extraordinary waste of human resources.</P>
      <P>In spite of the Minister's best efforts to present a plausible account of the Government's stewardship and to give exaggerated hope with his new initiative, including his statement that the picture looks good, the reality is that one-third of the workforce are unemployed. Almost every family is affected by this nightmare. This is causing well grounded fears that the burden created by the number of people on social welfare will become so great that the few who are employed will be unable to bear the costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On budget day the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, said that unemployment was the single greatest problem with which we have to contend and that the Government were keenly aware of the needs posed by the continuing growth in the labour force. Today Minister Cowen stated that unemployment remains our greatest challenge. We are continually given assurances by the <Col N="1478" /> Government that they truly care about this problem. Yet nothing is actually being done to create employment or halt the unemployment spiral. The Government need to face up to the brutal fact that unemployment has risen steadily since they took office in 1987. In April 1987, 250,689 people were unemployed. Today, five years later, 30,000 people have been added to that statistic. If we add to this the 11,000 people who have taken early retirement we can see that the real change in the unemployment figure is 41,000 &mdash; almost 8,000 people per year have been added to the dole queues. This can only be judged as a dismal failure by the Government. They have failed not only to reverse the trend in unemployment but also to put on the brakes at any time as this great unemployment train has rushed relentlessly past the 280,000 mark. Is it any wonder that many people look back with a touch of nostalgia to the time when former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, said that a Taoiseach's place was out of office if unemployment reached more than 100,000?</P>
    <P>The saddest and cruelest aspect of today's debate is that we cannot even hope at this stage that things will have improved by the time we discuss the 1993 Estimates. This may be a harsh prediction but over the past few months I have not witnessed any fresh thinking, new approaches or dramatic ideas; all I have seen is a miserable rejection of any good sound job policies put forward by the Opposition. Last week, before the ink was hardly dry on the Fine Gael policy document <i>Towards a Jobs Economy</i>, a Government spokesman dismissed it with the same stubborness and determination with which our call for an all party jobs forum was thrown out. I am convinced that statement was issued by the Government before the document was even read. Unfortunately, this leads me to believe that the Government will not accept any contribution from the Fine Gael Party, whatever its merits. A Government who hastily dismiss out of hands proposals for tackling the unemployment crises as outlined in the Fine Gael policy document cannot be serious <Col N="1479" /> about solving the unemployment problem. This behaviour must be stopped immediately and attitudes must change &mdash; our people deserve far more.</P>
    <P>We are reviewing in this debate a year of further missed opportunities; we are playing safe and judging issues. The only outstanding events which took place in the Department of Labour over the past 12 months were the three new ministerial appointments. However, in spite of this, the old ways have not been changed. There has been no change in policy, direction or attitude and, worst of all, no change in the worsening trend in unemployment.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the Estimates for the Department of Labour it is most regrettable to note that there has been a massive 25 per cent reduction in the grant for our teamwork scheme. This very successful and worthy scheme offered valuable experience and training to its participants and provided massive support to inadequately resourced centres catering for the handicapped, disabled and underprivileged. The reduced Estimate will cause immeasurable hardship to the many centres throughout the country which provide care for people who need it. The people in charge and the people who work in the centres, people who take it upon themselves to carry out this valuable work, are dismayed and shocked at the trimming in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is sinful and shameful that schools and day care centres which cater for the mentally and physically handicapped should be so understaffed, under financed and underresourced. The only assistance they received was through the teamwork scheme. This enabled moneys raised by voluntary associations to be directed to other much needed areas. The trainees on that scheme helped the staff to give these children the individual attention they needed. The real winners in this scheme are not the staff or the trainees; rather they are the children, who have benefited enormously. I have witnessed this in the three schools for the mentally handicapped in Cashel. I ask the Minister to review his decision to <Col N="1480" /> cutback on this scheme. A reduction of 25 per cent is not only unfair but is also unwise, mean and immoral. It will also hurt the most defenceless in our society. The Minister needs to give a caring and sympathetic response to these people. On behalf of all those who have benefited from and participated in the scheme I appeal to the Minister to reverse this decision and to allow teamwork to continue to operate at its original level in the knowledge that the money spent will not only be well spent but will be money deservedly spent.</P>
    <P>One should always welcome expenditure under the Department of Labour. This is even more important at a time when we have such a high level of unemployment. I am concerned that so little is being delivered in return for the amount of money spent. The role of the Department of Labour in solving the unemployment problem is becoming more and more critical in those times of massive unemployment. However, no impact is being made on the unemployment figures. We cannot continue to accept training and employment schemes, good and all as they are, as a real substitute for work and job creation.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the cost of unemployment. Almost every year a massive £700 million is spent on social welfare, over £200 million is spent on FÁS schemes and £135 million is spent by the IDA. What return have we seen for this money? All we have seen is more people on the dole queues. Having examined this massive expenditure and assessed the results, I believe we need to reinvestigate and radically rethink how we spend money in the unemployment area. We have to ask questions when money spent does not result in job creation and does not bring more people back to work. This is something that deservedly needs thorough investigation.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has launched two new schemes: the employment subsidy scheme and the job training scheme. While I welcome those schemes I have to ask the Minister whether they are merely replacing the old schemes. It is not good <Col N="1481" /> enough just to rename schemes and to change a few rules here and there. Since the announcement of these schemes teamwork and the social employment scheme have been cut back. Therefore, all I can assume is that the schemes announced by the Minister are replacing the old schemes. I would warn the Minister that changing names and changing titles will not fool those without a job. Their needs are so great and so urgent that they will not be codded by any trick. Schemes to remove people from the unemployment register must never be considered a replacement for the creation of long term employment. While I accept that these schemes have given those on long term unemployment a chance to return to work, a chance to experience once again what it is like to have a job, they must not be the final answer. They must merely be an interim solution to getting our people who are out of work for a number of years back into the working environment. We should let them see that it pays to take a job, but they must not be considered, as they have been for too long, the long term solution.</P>
    <P>Jobs are needed and are being demanded. What has been so often promised has been rarely delivered. The demand is not for interim jobs but for long term jobs and for the preservation of existing jobs. It is regrettable that the Department of Labour have continued to concentrate too much on employment schemes aimed at taking people off the live register. Trying to keep the numbers unemployed at a reasonable level is just not good enough and does not serve the long term purpose. More resources and greater emphasis must be placed not only on job creation but on job preservation.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we must question whether we are spending money wisely. Are our short term measures too expensive and are we having any impact on the unemployment crisis? We must scrutinise our training programmes. I welcome the Minister's statement today that he is prepared to designate one division of FÁS to training and education. I hope that will have the desired results. However, in doing so we must ask if we are training <Col N="1482" /> people for jobs that actually exist. At present training is going on in some areas where there are no vacancies and where there is an over-supply in the market. Yet we continue to spend funds on training in those areas. That is not sound economics.</P>
    <P>We must ask also whether we are providing unnecessary, unproductive courses for people who could well afford to pay for them themselves. At a time of enormous unemployment we cannot afford to provide courses for such people but unfortunately, in some of our FÁS training centres there are people who have the finance to provide for their own training. For every such person we are denying another person a place. I hope that when the Minister sets up this division in FÁS he will undertake a thorough and complete examination of how we are training, what we are training for and who we are training. As I have pointed out, enormous amounts of money are being spent but the results are not satisfactory. A radical review of the activities of FÁS is urgently called for to ensure that we get value for the more than £220 million spent.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to discrimination against women in the workplace. As far back as July 1990 the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, said during the Estimates debate that he was committed to the improvement of the status of women in employment. However, no action followed, with the result that two years later women still earn only 68 per cent of that earned by their male counterparts and promotion for women remains a rarity. The entire working environment continues to militate against women, with little or no child care facilities and few options of job sharing, career breaks and flexi-time. As a result, not only do women suffer but the economy suffers because many well abled women are forced from participation in the economy in that they have to choose to meet their domestic and parental responsibilities over pursuing a career.</P>
    <P>Today's Estimates are proof of the lip service that continues to be paid towards equality in employment. The main agency charged with responsibility for <Col N="1483" /> promoting, monitoring and encouraging equality at work continue to survive on a shoestring. They do not have sufficient finance to employ a research officer. The agency cannot succeed in encouraging or promoting change in attitudes towards equality until the Minister allocates the required finance for them to carry out their work. There is an increase in the Estimates today for the Employment Equality Agency but an increase on what, one must ask. When your budget is totally insufficient, a meagre increase means nothing. You are still prevented from carrying out the work you are charged with undertaking.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, because of the importance of the Employment Equality Agency, the nature of their work and the great task they have to undertake, which is to promote equality and to change attitudes, to provide the necessary resources. At present, I understand, that agency has one typist. How can a change in attitude towards equality be brought about in those circumstances? That confirms the Government's attitude towards the Employment Equality Agency. I am astounded at the amount of work that agency succeed in doing and the number of publications they succeed in producing on their shoestring budget. I can guarantee that those working in that agency are often forced to withhold courses because they do not have the resources to advertise them. It must be most frustrating not to be in a position to carry out the work they want to do.</P>
    <P>The disastrous trend in unemployment must be faced. Otherwise, 300,000 people will be unemployed by the end of the year. Closer European economic integration will give unrestricted access to larger markets, a stable currency and financial support. However, we will have to decide whether we use these opportunities to create jobs. For too long Ireland has failed to perform to its potential. It is to our shame that we top the unemployment league in the EC and that we are the country with the poorest record of turning economic growth into jobs. My party believe that we can <Col N="1484" /> redress and reverse this dangerous trend. We never submit to the inevitability of unemployment. We are determined to make the creation of jobs our top political priority.</P>
    <P>No-one can argue that present policies are failing. The Government have made no progress in tackling the unemployment crisis. They must, in the national interest, give serious consideration to the Fine Gael jobs policy launched last week. Our approach is based on putting initiatives back into people's hands, enabling them to establish clear areas of competitive advantage in the new Europe. We advocate a substantial change in the traditional approach.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all Ministers to make the provision of jobs their top priority. They must reassess and re-examine their decision to back down on the jobs forum and to dismiss the Fine Gael jobs policy. If unemployment is a priority for the Government, let them prove it. My party will continue their campaign to find ways and means of turning this jobless economy into a working economy. Our commitment will continue to be to get our people back to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's debate on the Labour Estimate is the appropriate forum to discuss the crisis that has emerged in industrial relations and unemployment. The Coalition Government have shown themselves to be incapable of tackling the many deep-seated problems affecting our society. We are a society in crisis. Unemployment is spiralling out of control with nearly 300,000 people unemployed. The past year has seen a sinister change in the industrial relations climate. This is something that must be faced. It is a climate which is alien to this country. It may be appropriate in the post-Thatcherite era in England but definitely not in Irish society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate debate gives an opportunity to analyse critically the performance of the Minister and of the Government on both these issues. On both counts they have failed dismally. The headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i><Col N="1485" /> on 9 May summed up the crisis on the industrial relations front. It indicated that the number of days lost through disputes soared to more than 52,000 in the first three months of this year. This compares with 10,000 days lost in the same period last year and slightly more than 80,000 in the full year. I do not need a crystal ball to see that records will be broken in this quarter. I take no pleasure in making that prediction. This is not in the best interests of the country. A new get tough macho approach has emerged among employers, with the tacit seal of approval from the Government. It is no coincidence that this new approach has emerged since this Government has taken over. In this period we have seen the bank dispute, the port dispute and the dispute in An Post have had devastating effects on the economy. There is a need to clarify the pattern that is emerging in each of these disputes.</P>
    <P>A dispute has closed the deep sea section of Dublin port. It is not in the national interest that this should be closed indefinitely, given that our economy relies on seaports for over 99 per cent in volume terms of overseas trade. Failure to improve facilities and port infrastructure could hinder the further expansion of trade with England, mainland Europe, North America, Japan and Australia. The expansion of Dublin Port, assisted by EC Structural Funds, is vital for our economy and to jobs in Dublin. The prolonged dispute, with up to 220 people redundant, could put at risk a capital investment of £9 million in Structural Funds. I am well aware of difficulties in the port over the years, particularly demarcation disputes. However, I am convinced through discussions with people on strike that there is an awareness on the part of unions and workers that negotiations must be held to resolve the dispute. I understand that a number of companies are seeking to set up there, but companies on their own are not enough. The people who will make them work are workers. I ask the Minister to get the parties together, through the Labour Relations Commission, to resolve this dispute. This dispute <Col N="1486" /> also has an effect of the job position in Dublin where unemployment has reached 32 per cent in the inner city. I appeal to the Minister to take action.</P>
    <P>The current industrial dispute in An Post is having a devastasting effect on economic life, particularly around Dublin. I take issue with the type of tactics being used by management. At a time when every effort is being made by the two unions involved to bring about a negotiated settlement, 1,300 workers are suspended. Yesterday some 600 further employees were suspended. The first they heard of this was on local radio. In God's name, how can we resolve disputes by this sort of mechanism? It is time for the Minister to knock heads together and to demand that the disputes be resolved.</P>
    <P>The resolution of this dispute has not been helped by the decision taken by management not to pay wages to nearly 2,600 employees, many of whom have been carrying out their normal duties. This management decision is scandalous, particularly as the employees in dispute were prepared to make up the salaries. The Government also have a role to play, particularly as a large majority of the staff enjoyed civil servant status prior to the vesting day of An Post. This condition was incorporated in the 1983 Act. The staff see things differently from the Minister. He should contact management to ensure that salaries are paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, in her one-sided contribution in the Dáil on this dispute, stated that the dispute was mainly about overtime. The recent proposals for settlement made by the unions have clearly shown that phased reductions on overtime earnings, recommended by the tribunal, will be implemented. There is sufficient scope within the proposals made yesterday for a negotiated resolution of the dispute. I am asking that all suspended members of the two unions be reinstated, that payment of wages outstanding as a result of the dispute be made immediately and that negotiations begin immediately to resolve other areas of dispute. I ask the Minister, not-withstanding the attitude of the Minister <Col N="1487" /> for Tourism, Transport and Communications, to take a line on this. The dispute cannot be allowed to escalate.</P>
    <P>The recent bank dispute saw the use once again of intimidation in industrial relations. We have seen intimidation of IBOA members pursuing a legitimate industrial dispute. This is deplorable and unacceptable, akin to things that happened in the thirties and forties. I thought we had got away from that. After I had made the allegations in the Dáil I received correspondence from the banks denying them, but from my contact with bank staff throughout the length and breadth of the country I know intimidation was rampant during the dispute. I hope we have all learned a lesson about the industrial relations climate in this country.</P>
    <P>I will now refer briefly to the unemployment crisis. The appalling human crisis of unemployment will get worse as the year goes on. This will have disastrous consequences for the Estimates we are discussing as well as for the thousands of families affected throughout the length and breadth of the country and the many people who will have to emigrate. It is about time some of our major political parties began to realise that the unemployment crisis cannot be addressed as if it was a matter like a mere football match and was just a matter of scoring points and goals.</P>
    <P>For years Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have consistently argued that if Government created the climate, the jobs would follow. They geared their policies exclusively to those who already have jobs rather than to the whole community. It is only now they are beginning to admit that the policies have been a complete failure. Some of Fine Gael's recent utterances show signs of a death bed conversion to the need for a more interventionist approach and in their recent policy document on the subject they have called for the creation of a national risk capital agency with funding of £500 million. What they seem to have forgotten is that they agreed to such proposals <Col N="1488" /> in the past, particularly when they were in Government in 1982, but they then spent several years ensuring they never got off the ground.</P>
    <P>A most proud people, and particularly the unemployed, will be impressed by what seems to be Fine Gael's passionate commitment to a jobs forum. However, they must be somewhat less impressed that Fine Gael have turned their backs on the nearest thing we will get to a jobs forum. The Labour Party campaigned for a long time to persuade the Government to intervene in the jobs crisis in a number of ways. We argued that the most important thing Government could do was to intervene and to start building a consensus around the issue so that unemployment became the first priority for the community. Building a consensus has always implied very firmly that the Government should build and expand on the social partnership model already in place so as to enable other forces in the community to contribute to finding solutions. That is why we have in the past called for a radical development and extension of the social partnership model, a detailed analyses of the problem and new approaches to solutions. The Labour Party put a great deal of work and effort into getting an all party committee on unemployment off the ground which is structured in a way that enables us to be inclusive of all the key players and with terms of reference that enable consensus for radical change to be developed.</P>
    <P>Most objective commentators who have looked at the structure that has emerged following discussions between the Labour Party and the Government have recognised that the Labour Party have made a major input to the framing of these terms. I am a member of that committee and I intend to give it my best shot to ensure that we come up with new ideas and new levels of involvement. I am also very encouraged by the commitment of our chairman, Deputy Dr. Hillery, and I hope we will make progress.</P>
    <P>Of course, the committee is not a perfect model. We have all made compromises <Col N="1489" /> to try to secure a basis for discussion that reflects the different objectives of the parties involved. We were aware that participating in this committee entails a degree of risk, particularly for an Opposition party whose instinct and role is to oppose proposals put forward by Government, to criticise instead of to initiate. We were prepared to take that risk. In my view this is the time to get stuck into the problem, put petty criticisms to one side and use all the other mechanisms available to us to influence policy. After all, this is the first time in the history of the State that agreement between the political parties leaves room and scope for the unemployed &mdash; this is very important &mdash; the voluntary agencies, the trade unions, the farmers, the social partners and the youth of this country. We will all have the opportunity to sit down together and make an input to Government policy. Let there be no mistake, if we in the committee and in the working sub-committees can develop a consensus around specific proposals and directions, it would be a very foolish Government indeed that would ignore that consensus.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party would have preferred a different and more inclusive structure, just as we would have preferred more detailed terms of reference. But we have chosen to compromise for one reason only &mdash; the seriousness of the crisis with nearly 300,000 people unemployed &mdash; because without consensus and the Government and Opposition parties modifying their ideological positions the crisis would get worse. With consensus there is a real possibility that we can do some of the difficult things that need to be done. Against that background I appeal at this late stage to the Fine Gael Party through their Labour spokeswoman, Deputy T. Ahearn, to change their minds and become involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said already, it is time to get stuck into the issues of unemployment, if for no other reason than to <Col N="1490" /> ensure that the cynicism and disillusionment with politicians and politics&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should get involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is rampant among the unemployed is dispelled once and for all.</P>
      <P>The childish political game-playing with the questions on yesterday's Order Paper will only heighten that cynicism. Unemployment is at the heart of the poverty and despair that afflicts thousands of families. It is at the core of our mounting health bill because it contributes to cases of depression, stress, family violence, alcoholism, mental breakdown, desertion and a host of other conditions. It is for this reason that all political parties should make every effort to come up with solutions in the jobs forum that will give some hope to those who are unfortunately unemployed.</P>
      <P>I now wish to refer briefly to those who have emigrated from this country. The principal mechanism through which the Irish Government provide support to the Irish voluntary bodies in Britain is the DÍON Committee. We are told that the aim of the Irish Government in providing funding is not to create a ghetto or a parallel welfare system for our emigrants but to develop and assist the voluntary bodies to reach persons at risk before they developed welfare dependency. In view of this I am utterly appalled that there has been no increase in the funding of the DÍON committee over the past number of years given the numbers of young people who have emigrated to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such is the extent of change in recent years in British legislation in the areas of housing, social welfare, education and employment policies that it is very difficult for many of our young people, particularly those without skills and qualifications, to obtain housing and employment on entry to England. Many of our emigrants do not have the necessary £400 or £500 to secure a flat or bedsit accommodation. In this Estimate there is <Col N="1491" /> no increase under this heading. I appeal to the Minister to examine this. The sum of £5,000 is totally inadequate to meet the needs of the many emigrants who require different levels of assistance and support both before and after they emigrate. I should like to ask the Minister to respond to this difficulty and take on board the positive recommendations put forward by the Labour Party this morning. I look forward to his response at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available to me I wish to focus primarily on the question of unemployment and jobs which the Minister described in his opening address as the most serious problem facing the nation. It is, indeed, the most serious problem facing our people. I should like to make some general comments about it. Clearly, nobody in this House under-estimates the scale of the problem, equally there is no quick fix. It would be wrong to pretend there is a ready overnight solution to our major unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>The economic policies of the past five years provide the foundation for future improvements in tackling the unemployment problem and from these policies have flown low inflation, above average growth by international standards and growing exports and other key factors. In other words, the financial state of the country is in a healthy condition.</P>
      <P>The Government have taken a range of initiatives in this regard. Among those are the Culliton report, the task force on employment and the new employment subsidy and training schemes which the Minister referred to in his speech, and which offer the prospect of 25,000 people being taken off the live register. In that context I would echo the appeal of the Minister for employer response and co-operation in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms the financial state of the country is as good as any other economy. We are well placed for a pick-up in the international economy, particularly if that pick-up occurs in the economies of the UK and the US. If there is a half <Col N="1492" /> decent bounce of the ball in international trading conditions we could benefit and return to higher rates of economic growth in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan constructively and honestly captured the essence of the new Joint Committee on Employment. He underlined &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that no single initiative will do the job. This is a new forum which we hope will complement other initiatives in tackling the most serious problem facing the country. I wish to compliment him on his honesty as it is not easy for an Opposition party to adopt that approach. It is far more comfortable to continue to oppose in the traditional fashion in a Parliament like ours than to co-operate with the Government side which, in parliamentary terms, is seen to have the main responsibility in the area of job creation and tackling the unemployment problem. It is precisely because the scale of the problem affects all of us, every party here and every person, that co-operation has been forthcoming from the Labour Party and other parties. We will give it our best effort and add what we can by way of initiative to the efforts already made. In other words, as a joint committee with our sub-committees we want to make our contribution which we hope will halt the unemployment trend and reverse it.</P>
    <P>We will have the important benefit of assistance from a range of social partners and other interest groups, for example, the National Youth Council, the unemployed, together with the trade unions, the employers and the farmers in addressing these problems. There will be much expertise between the committee and the sub-committees. Politicians here and in the Seanad are in touch daily with practical problems in relation to job creation and unemployment. We know all about it and we are acutely aware of it, we do have ideas and they need to be tapped. In that context I welcome the opportunity to hear what Opposition parties have to say in that forum in addressing the key national problem.</P>
    <P>The new joint committee is a unique forum in that it brings together politicians <Col N="1493" /> from both sides of the divide to contribute their ideas and their talents to addressing the unemployment problem. The committee focuses exclusively for the first time on jobs. Without going into too much detail I should say there will be three sub-committees: first, a sub-committee on job creation to identify opportunities and barriers to creating jobs; second, a sub-committee on the unemployed &mdash; a number of initiatives are important in the training area; and, third, a sub-committee to deal with the EC response to our unemployment problem. As the Minister has indicated, substantial funds have been transferred to this country from Brussels.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining I should like to refer briefly to the directions we hope to take. I mentioned earlier that there may be barriers to job creation. As a committee we will be looking at the taxation and social welfare systems to see whether they are presenting roadblocks or disincentives to job creation. For example, is the taxation system driving people into the black economy? Another area we need to look at is the impressive economic growth here in recent years. What is disappointing is that the number of jobs has not matched that economic growth. The National Economic and Social Council, together with several other resources available to us on the Joint Committee on Employment, have undertaken a study to try to identify the root of this mismatch between substantial economic growth on the one hand and the disappointing level of jobs created on the other. We will all be pooling our ideas on unemployment.</P>
    <P>While multinational companies play an important part in Irish life, providing 40 per cent of industrial employment, it is disappointing that the supply of components and other products to these companies are imported from abroad. It has been estimated that £1 billion worth of imports for the multinational companies operating here could actually be produced in Ireland. That is something we need to address in the Joint Committee. In fairness I should say the IDA are examining this problem through the linkage <Col N="1494" /> programme. I expect to hear from the IDA in that committee as to where they are at and where they are going in terms of developing these linkages. Needless to say, if we produce £1 billion worth of components here for supply to the multinationals already here that would create many urgently required jobs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to refer to the relatively stable industrial relations environment we have had for many years but with pressure points now which are worrying to us all. At the end of the day direct negotiations &mdash; eyeball to eyeball contact &mdash; between unionised workers on the one hand and employers on the other are the essence of resolving problems. The State does have a role to play which is to provide dispute settling machinery to help both sides of industry to help themselves.</P>
    <P>I know that from time to time Ministers are called on to intervene in disputes and they have a facilitating role. I want to make the point, nonetheless, that the Minister for Labour has no statutory function in relation to industrial disputes. What the Minister for Labour is responsible for, in an overall way, is labour law and the dispute settling machinery, such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. At the end of the day it is the quality, the knowledge, the attitudes and the skills on both the union side and management &mdash; because both are terribly important &mdash; that leads to good industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In a democracy it would be unrealistic to think that all disputes are resolved between the parties themselves, although the great majority of them are. Hence the necessity to have third party machinery; the consensus approach to which the trade unions, the employers and the farmers made a major contribution through the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> If we could devolve that consensus and that level of co-operation through to the workplace we would certainly be going a <Col N="1495" /> long way. That must be one of our aims in that regard.</P>
    <P>On a final note, participative arrangements, often initiated by management but also through legislation in the case of the semi-State bodies, are very much a step in the right direction. Employees nowadays have relatively high expectations. They expect to be treated as adults. Management need to to be honest, open, fair and consistent. At the end of the day it is the two parties facing one another who are the key to good industrial relations, supported where necessary by third party machinery provided by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start by taking up that point made by Deputy Hillery. I know that Deputy Hillery has spent a long time discussing this subject from the relative calm of University College, Dublin. As somebody who was involved in the eyeball to eyeball discussions that he spoke about, I must say that he is coming up with something of a rationalisation of the role of the Minister for Labour and the Department of Labour. The previous occupant of this post was oft praised in this House by Deputy Hillery for the success with which he intervened frequently in disputes. It seems that never in the history of our industrial relations has an interventionist policy been more necessary on the part of a Minister for Labour than at present. I am really not very impressed by the carefully worded opening address of the Minister or by Deputy Hillery's rationalisation of the role of the Department and the Minister as being to put the legislative framework in place and then to leave the resolution of disputes to the two parties. Of course they have a major and central role, but in no set of circumstances does a dispute that threatens the commercial health of the country allow the Minister to sit back and leave it to the Labour Relations Commission or any agency acting in his name. In the case of the postal dispute, it is time the Minister got down off his motorbike and got stuck <Col N="1496" /> into that dispute and helped towards its resolution.</P>
      <P>From my point of view, the need for an active interventionist Department of Labour has never been more evident against a background of the highest unemployment figures ever recorded, redundancy figures for the first three months of this year that are the worst since the corresponding period in 1988 and a deteriorating industrial relations picture which has resulted in a five-fold increase in the number of days lost through disputes in the first three months of this year compared to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Government seem content to allow the industrial relations situation to worsen even further and are devoid of any ideas for dealing with the unemployment crisis. Nothing sums up the cynical approach of the Government to those on the live register better than the press conference held last week by the Minister for Labour to announce the new jobs training scheme. This was the fourth occasion on which this scheme was announced. Yet, on the Minister's own admission, not one single trainee has yet been taken on. It was originally announced by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, at a Cáirde Fáil dinner on 28 November last. It was reannounced by Deputy Haughey in the House on 17 December last. It was announced by the Minister for Finance yet again in the budget on 29 January so that the budget could have the appearance of saying something about the unemployed. It was announced yet again yesterday by Minister Cowen.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should take the advice of his own people within the Department of Labour who have concluded that this scheme is a nonsense and, as presently structured, will not work. There is no point in fooling the unemployed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the advice I am getting from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I believe it is. There is no point in fooling the unemployed <Col N="1497" /> and then fooling the Members of this House that this scheme has any particular potential. Six months after it was first announced not one person has been taken off the live register although we were told last December that the scheme would begin rolling on 1 January. Is it any wonder that the unemployed feel abandoned and demoralised when they see this sort of approach? How many more press conferences or announcements will they have to endure before the scheme actually begins?</P>
      <P>The huge increase in the number of days lost through industrial disputes this year indicates an important change in the attitude of management to industrial relations. There is now a much more macho approach to industrial relations and, indeed, to public relations in both the private and the public sector where suspension and disciplinary action take the place of dialogue and negotiation. It is at its most evident in the current dispute in An Post but it was also seen in recent disputes in RTE, the banks and Dublin Cargo Handling. It is as if senior management believe that with the unemployment levels at record levels and the unions locked into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> now is the ideal time to take on the unions and diminish their role and authority. Such an approach is likely to plunge the country into a long running period of industrial relations strife which will be in nobody's interests. The issues at the heart of the dispute in An Post are complex involving, as they do, not just the rights of postal workers but possible job opportunities for the unemployed and the future of the postal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is further complicated by the continuing precarious position of An Post, but what is very clear is that the senior management of An Post have behaved grossly irresponsibly and have unilaterally provoked the current dispute. It is now three weeks since this happened, and while the reaction of the union has been relatively restrained, management have gone ahead with massive suspensions and penalisation of workers. Workers, without any notice, <Col N="1498" /> have been taken off the payroll and families given no pay last weekend.</P>
    <P>Even in a more electronic age the potential commercial damage caused by a long running post dispute will be enormous. Orders lost may never be re-won. The international reputation of the country will be further damaged. The Government cannot remain on the sidelines and must take action. The Minister for Communications, who seems to have come under the spell of Mr. Hynes, is taking a totally partisan position in this House and, in those circumstances, the Minister for Labour must intervene.</P>
    <P>The spokesperson for Fine Gael, Deputy Ahearn, quite properly devoted the latter part of her speech to the question of unemployment. The situation is tragic as it heads inexorably for 300,000. It would appear that the Minister for Labour is taking the attitude that this, no more than directly intervening in disputes, is really not his responsibility, that it is the responsibility of the other wing of the Coalition Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>The facts are that we need a comprehensive approach towards unemployment involving the Department of Labour. Listening to the monitor I heard Deputy Ryan deal with this subject. He seemed to be casting love eyes across the floor at Deputy Hillery from what I heard, and I hope his confidence is well placed because I also am a member of the all-party jobs committee and certainly it is the intention of my party to try to make it work. However, I think that any crowing about it is premature because we have a very long way to go before it is clear that we can come up with proposals that are capable of being, and likely to be, acted on expeditiously by the Government. It is far too early for those of us who are members of the committee to hold out the prospect of the unemployed that it is going to make a major contribution in resolving the unemployment crisis but I sincerely hope it will. As I said, it is the intention of my party to make a contribution to that effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> I am surprised that there is no reference in the Minister's speech to the legislative work that he is committed to. For example, a specific commitment was given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to bring forward, by the end of 1991, an Employment Equality Bill. I am sorry to see that this has such a low priority with the Minister and the Department of Labour because the notion that the existing equality legislation has dealt with the problem satisfactorily is nonsense. Deputy Ahearn drew attention to the fact that women workers are still on 68 per cent of comparable male earnings. That is the situation.</P>
    <P>As well as this, it pays no attention to the dynamic of the equality issue to energise the workforce and make a major contribution in resolving the unemployment problem. It seems that the attitude of the Department is that the unemployment problem is bad enough without encouraging the circumstances that would invite more women into the labour market to contend for scarce jobs. I do not think that is acceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over what Deputy Ahearn had to say with regard to the Employment Equality Agency being starved of resources but that is the situation &mdash; it is not that the Employment Equality Agency have been canvassing us on that point. All of us know that that is the situation and the Minister should deal with it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I note what the Minister had to say about low pay and that this is a priority in his programme for the coming year. I am very dubious, however, about the efficacy of the measures he proposes. I am very familiar with the joint labour committee mechanism and so on and I think that it has made only a moderate contribution. Until the Government face up to the question of introducing a national minimum wage we will never deal with the problem of low pay and the poverty traps caused.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks on training and his commitment to implement the proposals of the Culliton <Col N="1500" /> report. This is a major issue in terms of our future prosperity and employment. The question of the skills differential as between this economy and other economies, to which he referred, is a major one and the focus and concentration of FÁS must be looked at again. We must put more emphasis on upgrading the employment skills of those in employment if we are to compete with other economies. I welcome the Minister's commitment in his speech and I would like to hear from him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me avail of my first opportunity in public to warmly congratulate my very good friend, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, on his appointment. I think he has already shown that he is more than capable of dealing with this important portfolio and does not require any lecture from Deputy Rabbitte or anyone else on how he should handle his brief. In particular, he exercised tremendous diplomacy and showed tremendous negotiating skills in his performance in relation to the recent banks strike and deserves to be warmly congratulated <Col N="1501" /> for this. I wish him every success in this position and I know that he will be a resounding success, as he has been during the past few months. It is regrettable that Fine Gael have decided not to participate in the jobs forum.</P>

      <P>While the jobs forum will not be the panacea for every ill or difficulty in the country, it may help to resolve what is a very serious problem.

      <P>The only reasonable conclusion that one can reach is that having mooted the idea of a jobs forum Fine Gael did not honestly believe that it would ever be set up but, having been set up, they then decided that it probably would not work and they did not want to shoulder any of the responsibility for the situation which might pertain once the forum began to do their work. In other words, having proposed that a jobs forum be set up in the first instance they subsequently displayed that they did not believe it would work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the position in relation to industrial relations &mdash; let me take the heat off Deputy Ahearn &mdash; the Minister has stated that he is concerned about the rising level of industrial unrest. This is perfectly true at a time when the country can ill afford it.</P>
      <P>I, too, would like to address the present situation at An Post. If we are to call a spade a spade &mdash; and we should do so &mdash; how can we expect to create employment when a semi-State body are paying £21 million in overtime in the central sorting office in Sheriff Street in Dublin and when people will not allow others to take up temporary employment? I should say that I wish people the best of luck in trying to secure the best possible wage for their families but it is a known fact that the wage and overtime bill at An Post in some instances is 70 per cent higher than in the provinces. I do not think we can honestly attempt to resolve the unemployment problem if that situation is allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, of course, that management in An Post have to shoulder some of the blame because when they decided to rationalise the service instead of addressing the problem at the central sorting office they decided to close down 550 sub-post offices around the country to save a few million pounds. It seems this approach is not in line with social equity; <Col N="1504" /> neither can it be condoned. I would strongly oppose their efforts because it seems when things start to go wrong in this country the vulnerable are hit while those at fault are left alone. That must not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>An Post have failed miserably over the years to enter into the marketplace in this regard. They have failed to compete in a sensible way with commercial banks, they have failed to advertise some excellent savings schemes, to computerise and enter the modern age. An Post management are guilty of outdated practices but some unions in An Post want to preserve a very cosy practice at the expense of the nation and, indeed, their own employees in the provinces. This should not be allowed to continue and the matter must be dealt with head-on.</P>
    <P>Unions members of An Post not employed in Sheriff Street should be extremely careful to ensure that their rights are safeguarded and that their position is protected. They must realise this and not allow themselves to be used by people who, in some instances, are receiving wages 70 per cent higher than theirs. They are preventing employees from getting temporary work and are &mdash; directly or indirectly &mdash; creating unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Government have made reasonable efforts to tackle unemployment, it is a very serious problem and there is a downward trend in emigration. Of course any socially conscious Government have the responsibility to create as much employment as they possibly can. In this regard initiatives taken, particularly in rural areas, have begun to work. The Leader programme is an example. I also welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach two weeks ago regarding establishing 12 pilot projects around the country to tackle the problem of the long term unemployed. It means that an unemployed person who has a viable project can get unemployment assistance for one year and maintain his or her fringe benefits while trying to set up in business. It is a very welcome development and I sincerely hope it helps to resolve the <Col N="1505" /> problem. I am sure it will have some impact.</P>
    <P>I again call on Fine Gael to come off the fence in relation to jobs and to come into the arena where decisions and proposals can be made and discussed.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind Deputy O'Donoghue that his party did not accept the jobs forum and did not make any effort to put such a forum in place. We now have an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment which will be merely a talking shop. Of course they will produce reports &mdash; of which we have a multitude gathering dust in offices all over the country &mdash; but which will do nothing to solve unemployment.</P>
      <P>Ministers are not answerable any more to the Dáil, we cannot get answers from them and our proposal in relation to the jobs forum would have been an opportunity for Ministers to answer pertinent questions in relation to unemployment. The Minister's speech does not offer any hope to the unemployed masses. The schemes announced are supposed to be the panacea for all our ills and will mean a major cut in unemployment at the end of the year. We are moving towards the dangerous figure of 300,000 people unemployed more quickly than we think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the level of youth unemployment which, at the end of April, amounted to more than 80,000 and which is increasing. Ireland now has over 28 per cent of youth unemployment which ranks among the highest in Europe and is totally unacceptable. The lack of jobs opportunities is having a devastating effect on the morale of our young people. The feedback I have received from several teachers throughout the country is that they are experiencing a total loss of <Col N="1506" /> motivation and lack of commitment in their schools because of the few opportunities for school leavers and the loss of hope in relation to getting a job.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned training schemes. As I pointed out, the apprenticeship scheme is a disgrace, it is the most inequitable part of our system of education. No other part of our education system is as discriminatory as the apprenticeship scheme because parents and their children have to go around cap in hand, similar to the guild scheme in mediaeval times, on their knees to employers and, in some cases, even paying them to be sponsored. It is a disgrace and there is no reason for people who want to pursue a trade of their choice not being able to apply for a specific place and compete on a equal footing with everybody else. I know the Minister promised a new module and I hope it will be introduced in 1993, as promised. It must be fair and equitable because the present system has given rise to a great deal of frustration.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the employment subsidy scheme. I know the Minister has a target of 15,000 jobs for the scheme during this year. I am glad there has been a take-up to date but the Minister should ensure that this scheme is not used by unscrupulous employers as a cheap labour scheme. The jobs being created should not cause other people to lose jobs. This scheme &mdash; and the jobs training scheme which the Minister mentioned in his speech &mdash; should be carefully vetted. In relation to training schemes, each employer should produce a module to the workers, parents and indeed to FÁS in regard to the type of training which will be given. That is very important because the scheme has not been carefully thought out, it has been put in place without introducing a pilot programme beforehand. I fear it will be misused by a number of unscrupulous employers.</P>
    <P>This year 1,000 jobs will be lost in social employment schemes. As it is we are running over quota and several good schemes, which will come up for renewal at the end of the year and will not be <Col N="1507" /> continued with a resultant loss of important services and jobs. It will also have an effect on several voluntary groups around the country. I referred to the teamwork scheme after Christmas when it was announced that it would be cut by £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister responded and I thank him for doing so. He has put £500,000 back into the scheme, a more than welcome measure, and I compliment him on doing that. Even so, more than 300 youth workers will lose their jobs this year. I draw attention to a very good scheme for young travellers operating in Tallaght which is organised by the Catholic Youth Council. More than 12 young travellers will have their employment terminated on 17 May because of a cut in funding for the scheme. That is a tragedy. I appeal to the Minister to consider the position of that very successful scheme, which has operated in an area that has huge social problems.</P>
    <P>Youth unemployment should have a special focus. As a nation, we have to make a special response to that problem or else we will have on our hands major social problems. So many of our young people are now becoming disillusioned and alienated from the system because of a lack of employment opportunities. The Minister is a young man and I am sure he can relate to the needs and aspirations of young people. I appeal to him to make a special effort to deal with the problem of youth unemployment because from that unemployment stem many of our social problems, such as an increased level of crime, a lack of regard for law and order and under-age drinking. The kernel of the disillusionment and the lack of motivation among many youth is unemployment. I ask the Minister to make youth unemployment one of the main issues of focus for departmental policy in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the two programmes he has brought in to date, the job training scheme and the employment subsidy scheme, which have targets of <Col N="1508" /> 10,000 and 15,000 jobs respectively. The on-the-job approach to training is especially welcome. There are many people in Galway who are also very pleased with the Minister's performance in some of the recent industrial disputes. I hope that he keeps up his good work in that respect.</P>
      <P>The unemployment problem can be tackled successfully. I have no doubt about that. That must be done without incurring an increased cost to the Exchequer. I firmly believe that a more effective use of the present expenditure could significantly increase the number of people at work. I shall suggest three initiatives to the Minister today. These initiatives are not aimed only at the Minister but require combined action by various Government Departments. As one of the Members on the job forum, I shall pursue those initiatives, and others, further. It is important today to make some suggestions to the Minister for his consideration. The first suggested initiative is long term and the second and third initiatives are short term.</P>
      <P>We must identify the traditional sectors of industry which have, perhaps, been hit hard but which also have the greatest potential for growth in jobs and in the economy generally. Those sectors are the food industry, the clothing and textile industry and the tourist industry. An investment and development programme for each sector for the next eight years to take us to the end of the century would give a significant return in jobs and economic growth. If I have time, I shall return to this first suggestion at the end of my contribution.</P>
      <P>The second suggestion is a short term initiative that is now urgently required. While the two initiatives introduced already are welcome, as I have said, between them they still provide for only 25,000 new jobs. It is my view that at present the greatest inhibition to the creation of jobs in this country is bureaucracy. A radical approach is now required to move away from the present system of paying people to do nothing and charging employers much too much to employ people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> We must devise a programme whereby 100,000 people are taken off the dole and put to work. My suggestion is that the State should pay them the equivalent of their dole and the employer pay the remaining amount to bring those employed up to the average industrial wage. For illustration purposes we could take the case of a married man with two children who at present receives £107 per week unemployment assistance. The employer who gave him a job would add £82 to the amount already received, bringing that man's income up to the normal industrial take home pay. The man would then work for his dole instead of doing nothing or doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; and the employer would have an incentive to employ people whom at present he cannot afford. Employers would be subject to a quota based on the number at present employed and to an employment guarantee at the end of the programme period, which should be a maximum of three years.</P>
    <P>It is only by the adoption of such a radical approach that we will make a serious dent in the large number of people unemployed. The approach is radical in that we have to move away from the present ethos that the Government pay people as long as there is a guarantee that they do nothing. That approach has not worked in the past and it is certainly not the way forward for the future. There is no question that employers both large and small would not be delighted at an opportunity for involvement in such a scheme. If anybody were to say to me that there is no point in continuing to pay a person the unemployment assistance of £107 per week received at present for the next three years because the State cannot afford to do that, I would respond with the honest statement that at the present state of play, irrespective of which party are in Government, the State will in any event have to continue to pay those 100,000 people concerned £107 per week for the next three years to remain unemployed. I put it to the Minister that this radical kind of approach is necessary. It is radical, it is new and it certainly goes against <Col N="1510" /> the <i>status quo</i> that has operated in this country in the past. The jobs forum will put forward proposals of this kind and I hope that the Government will respond positively to them.</P>
    <P>The third suggested initiative I put to the Minister and to the Government in general is to take government from around the necks of the people. By that I mean that we must diminish the absolute power that is now held within one square mile of O'Connell Bridge in Dublin. I shall suggest a practical example whereby for the amount of expenditure already being incurred many more jobs could be created by the adoption of a regional approach to job creation.</P>
    <P>To illustrate my suggestion I give the example of a county, for argument's sake, Galway county, which would be designated as a pilot project. An employment authority would be established in the county and the members of that authority would come from State agencies at present located in Galway. Those agencies are: the IDA, represented by Tom Hyland; Bord Fáilte, represented by Brian Flynn; the local authority, represented by Séamus Keating; the Department of Social Welfare, represented by Michael O'Kennedy; Teagasc, represented by Gerry Scully and FÁS, represented by Tony Barrett. If we were to take the amount of State money going into Galway this week through those various agencies and give those six representatives the flexibility to use that money &mdash; which they are now spending in any event &mdash; with the emphasis on creating jobs, I have no doubt that a flexible, local, regionalised approach would bring about many more jobs in the Galway area than are created at present from following the O'Connell Bridge approach.</P>
    <P>I shall give the House two examples that I came across last week. There is a man in my own town of Gort whom the county council can afford to pay for only half a week to keep the streets of our town clean and tidy. When the council's budget runs out that man has to go back on the dole. As a consequence, he spends a certain number of weeks at home on <Col N="1511" /> the dole and for the rest of the year he spends only half a week doing the most important job that has to be done in Gort, that of keeping the place clean. It is completely ridiculous that such a position applies in this day and age. Commonsense has gone out the window and bureaucracy is there at its best.</P>
    <P>I can give another example of a man for whom I filled up an application form last week. That man works for nine months each year, claims unemployment benefit for the other three as he cannot be employed for those three. He earns £109 a week for the nine months and gets £129 for the three months he is off. It is time we stopped this kind of charade.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a scheme the Minister announced six months ago and it was said that to date not one job had been created. From my experience in the Department of Education I could believe that that is true. It is not the Minister's fault or the fault of the civil servants. It is the fault of the structure under which they have to operate. Until there is fundamental change in the way we run our business we will not be able to tackle unemployment. Perhaps we will be able to talk about this in detail soon. My experience in the Department over the past five years has been that no matter how one tries or how good one's civil servants are &mdash; and they are the best &mdash; one will be beaten by the system. When one gets a file from the Department of Education it has to be signed by four civil servants none of whom can take a decision. We cannot run a country like that. The sooner politicians face up to the fact that we have to have fundamental reform of the Oireachtas the better. The reform that has taken place is welcome. We must also have fundamental reform of the public service. I emphasise that I am not talking about the people involved but the structures within which they have to operate. We must also have a fundamental reform of the electoral system. Until we do that we cannot hope to satisfactorily tackle unemployment. When we tackle those basics we will be able to deal with unemployment successfully. We are <Col N="1512" /> spending enough money to put people to work but we are not spending it effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate on the Estimate for the Department of Labour must cover the huge number of people who are unemployed. Everyone has a genuine interest in trying to put forward suggestions to resolve the problem, regardless of political affiliations. I get intensely annoyed when I hear sanctimonious outbursts from the Government side of the House that Fine Gael should join what is now called the jobs forum. We had a motion before the House some weeks ago which was supported by the Opposition parties, calling for a jobs forum. The Government parties defeated that motion on the basis that the Government had their own proposals. They came forward with a proposal to establish a joint committee. Without disrespect to the joint committee I would like to explain to Members on the Government side of the House the difference between a forum and a joint committee, as they obviously do not yet know it. In the New Ireland Forum Members from both sides of the House participated to good effect. While the problem it set out to resolve have not yet been resolved, at least it had a lasting impact on the problem. That was because Ministers, and the Taoiseach went before the forum, made solid contributions and answered questions raised. They were willing to be questioned and to discuss the issues considered important for a forum. It was a serious issue of national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The jobs crisis is also a serious issue, not one to be tossed around between a committee and a forum or a combination of both. If a forum was called for we should have established one. If it was thought necessary, in a serious attempt to solve unemployment, to bring the people who are supposed to have the best ideas together under the one roof to get their collective wisdom on how to tackle the problem, we should have set up a forum. I do not want to see any more crocodile tears shed by that side of the House or suggestions that we have a jobs forum <Col N="1513" /> because we have not. It is an insult to the people who are seeking work that it should be suggested that a serious attempt is being made to deal with the problem, when it is not. Instead of crocodile tears there should be more application to the job in hand. We should get some indication from the Government parties as to whether they are serious about solving the problem or whether they want to whitewash the issue or try to get people believe they are doing something about it.</P>
    <P>When one compares the other European countries to ours and notes the low levels of unemployment in those countries, it should spur us on to come to grips with the real issue and ask ourselves how serious we are about tackling the problem. Up to 36 per cent of our population is in receipt of social welfare benefit of one kind or another, including pensions. We have an unacceptably high level of unemployment. Some people suggest that unemployed people are not really making an effort, but I do not accept that. The fact that there are 300,000 people seeking work at the same time should have impressed on the Government the seriousness of the problem but it has not. The jobs are not there.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fahey that the system has gone awry. It was simple 25 or 30 years ago but it is now a convoluted system which makes it virtually impossible to get a job and for employers to provide jobs. The Minister has a responsibility. I hope he will, without waiting for the joint committee to report, deal with some of the points raised by the last speaker, and will simplify the system so that a person can be employed without disadvantaging the employer or himself. In some quarters people are losing out by going back to work. There should be a graduated system of benefits such as medical cards when a person returns to work, instead of a cut-off point.</P>
    <P>People can become cynical about this problem. While I accept the Minister meant well, the proposal to locate FÁS training schemes abroad is tantamount to a proposal to export our unemployed people. We have always tried to improve <Col N="1514" /> our exports and we are now attempting to export our people because we are not in a position to provide jobs for them. I am particularly cynical about this proposal at a time when local authorities and voluntary groups who have made submissions to FÁS under the team work scheme and the SES have been told that sufficient funds are not available to allow the schemes proceed. They have been told in recent weeks there are not sufficient funds to allow that scheme be implemented. For example, Kildare County Council, Maynooth Community Council and the local Tidy Towns Committee were all told in recent weeks: &ldquo;we are very sorry, but there are not sufficient funds to allow the scheme be implemented.&rdquo; It must be remembered that these people are considering a proposal to take some of our trainees out of the country where they will no longer be needed and to train them abroad. Admittedly, we know that it will be a system assisted from outside the country and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To date, despite repeated requests on the part of the Minister's colleagues in Kildare County Council, and his colleagues here as well, there has been total disregard on the part of both the Department of Energy and the Minister's Department &mdash; and they should <Col N="1515" /> have an interest in the matter &mdash; to the extent that the people in Lullymore continue to inquire what is the Government attitude to that plant.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one or two other points in relation to this Estimate. I appreciate that my time is running out, but it is running out also for our unemployed and for An Post because the electorate awaiting a service from them expect the Government at least to make some reference to the fact that there is at present a serious postal dispute. Indeed, people are posing the question: how much longer must we wait before there is a Government initiative taken <i>vis-à-vis</i> this postal dispute? While my time has expired, it is fast expiring in the case of those people awaiting that essential service and, I predict, even faster for the people on the far side of the House who failed to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I must compliment the Minister on the manner in which he is facing up to our present unemployment problem. Indeed, he had been only the proverbial wet day in his Ministry when he established himself as an enthusiastic, competent and dynamic Minister for Labour. He has already forged for himself an ultra impressive track record. For example, there was his handling of the banks dispute &mdash; a dispute which had the potential to totally demolish the commercial life of the country &mdash; which brought well deserved praise from all quarters.</P>
      <P>I requested the Minister recently to take an initiative <i>vis-à-vis</i> a serious set of circumstances which arose in my constituency when a firm called Wicklow Woods found themselves confronted with possible closure and the loss of 160 jobs. The Minister immediately intervened to such prompt and dynamic effect that a rescue package is already in place. I contend a job saved is as good as a job created and I thank the Minister for his intervention in that case from the bottom of my heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the total support of the Taoiseach and his colleagues in Government, <Col N="1516" /> despite certain obduracy with which he was confronted, the Minister established the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment under the chairmanship of Deputy Brian Hillery. I wish Deputy Hillery and his colleagues success in their endeavours &mdash; he would appear to be in the vanguard of the work launched to tackle and correct our colossal unemployment problem. I wish both the Minister and Deputy Hillery every success in providing the appropriate leadership in this vital crusade.</P>
    <P>I want now to highlight a particular malaise obtaining. I refer to the plethora of appeals, objections to and disagreements with ventures and projects geared to job creation. All of the efforts of the Minister for Labour, of Deputy Hillery and his committee and of all the good people involved in this unemployment purge will be set at nought if an air of responsibility cannot be brought to bear within this whole area of job creation. The negative, obdurate approach, so detrimental to job creation, must be abolished.</P>
    <P>I might give a couple of examples to illustrate what I mean in that respect. For example, in my county of Wicklow there is a certain element who, under the guise of protecting the environment and in the interests of conservation, object to virtually every positive attempt to preserve and/or create employment. For example, one firm called Avondale Chemicals, a subsidiary of the multinational company, Schering Plough, want to extend their factory in my home town of Rathdrum. This involves a £50 million investment, some 360 jobs in the construction process and 100 permanent jobs thereafter. In the climate of our present difficulties that is like manna from heaven. The local authority, after careful consideration and having thoroughly examined the overall position, approved the necessary planning application. Stitched into that planning permission are stringent conditions, costing millions of pounds, to ensure that the environment will be protected and that there will be no detrimental effects from this venture in the overall area. But of course the inevitable happened &mdash; an <Col N="1517" /> appeal to An Bord Pleanála, when the whole venture may well be delayed for months, if not for years, such has been the track record of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I contend that this is sabotage, that the people who involve themselves in this are saboteurs of job creation. Indeed its wider implications are horrific, because we in Wicklow &mdash; but this applies nationwide &mdash; will be viewed as &ldquo;no go&rdquo; people, as people with an aversion to progress, to investment and indeed to investors. I appeal to these professional objectors to have a rethink. Many of them may well be decent, genuine people who are being carried along on a wave and who may well be genuinely interested in maintaining a clean, healthy environment. Perhaps the damage they are doing to the efforts to create jobs is inadvertent. I would appeal to them to have a rethink, to go back to the drawing board and endeavour to invoke that air of responsibility about which I spoke earlier with regard to appeals to An Bord Pleanála. When I talk to such people they endeavour to differentiate between an appeal and an objection; they engage in this type of ambiguous thinking. It must be recognised that an appeal to An Bord Pleanála constitutes an objection, a deterrent, an effort to frighten investors.</P>
    <P>I appeal to this and other responsible Ministers to ensure that commonsense will prevail <i>vis-à-vis</i> An Bord Pleanála decisions. For example, if appeals to Bord Pleanála could be given priority and decisions expedited, it would at least alleviate some of the problems at present encountered. In so requesting I am not advocating interference with the due legal process of that board; nothing is further from my thoughts. But if job creation projects, such as the one I have just mentioned, could be given priority whenever appeals are lodged, treated expeditiously and a decision handed out quickly it would somewhat alleviate the overall position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to compliment the Minister on his appointment. Indeed, he had a baptism of fire, since from the very <Col N="1518" /> moment of appointment he experienced considerable difficulties. He has handled the unfortunate bank strike admirably. He intervened, though it was understood that it is not a Minister's job so to do. Nonetheless, bearing in mind the overall climate of industrial relations here, Ministerial intervention is sometimes necessary and is to be welcomed. I am sure all Members would call on the Minister today to do likewise in respect of the postal dispute. Although it is a very difficult dispute, the management now admit that the problems have been caused by decisions made by them in the past. For example, they offered voluntary redundancies to a large number of employees without putting in place an alternative system which would ensure a proper postal delivery service. As a result, their employees were forced to work overtime to ensure that the job was done properly. Employing casual workers to do this work is not the answer to the problem. I join with my colleague Deputy Ryan in asking the Minister to get both sides to sit down together to resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers said, the people working in the Department of Labour are among the best in any Department. I know from experience the commitment of these people, from the secretary down, to their job and their willingness to deal with the problems raised by public representatives from all constituencies. They were of great assistance in trying to resolve the Barlo dispute in Clonmel and in helping to bring that company back into production and profitability. Unfortunately Clonmel has a very high unemployment level. Companies such as Digital, the bacon industry and the food industry have suffered dramatically in recent years. No town in my constituency has managed to escape these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of days I and other Members of the Oireachtas from my area have been criticised by Fianna Fáil councillors for not having raised in this House the unemployment problem in Carrick-on-Suir. I would remind these councillors that responsibility for most of <Col N="1519" /> the unemployment crisis in this area lies with the Government because of their failure to address this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Only the Deputy was criticised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Cahir, Cashel and Tipperary town &mdash; all have high levels of unemployment. Last Monday I counted a total of 14 industries and retail outlets for sale in Tipperary town. This will devastate the area and lead to poverty and disadvantage. As my colleague, Deputy Ryan, said, unemployment is at the heart of poverty and despair. Unemployment is also about institutionalised inequality. There is a cause and effect relationship between unemployment and the planning which was put into some of the devastated and alienated suburbs in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and other towns and villages. There is also a cause and effect relationship between unemployment and poor access to education. There is a link between unemployment, poverty and disadvantage which cannot be broken; they form part of a vicious circle of inequality.</P>
      <P>Several statements issued by the Labour Party have referred to unemployment as a national powder keg, a time bomb of alienation which is threatening to explode in the community. Every day we ignore this crisis we are taking a major risk. I do not believe I am being alarmist or engaging in scare-mongering when I say that there will be an increase in the incidence of violence in towns and villages if some effort is not made to address this major problem. We also need to convince people that we are serious about what we are doing. This is why I believe all parties should be involved in any initiative to solve the unemployment crisis. Fine Gael should submit their policy document to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment as some of the proposals put forward by them might be worth pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little point in politicians and other expressing shock and horror in <Col N="1520" /> local provincial newspapers about poverty and the marginalisation in our society which can lead to outbreaks of violence and, at times, disturbances in the workplace if nothing is done to solve the unemployment problem. The insult of unemployment becomes an obscenity when the Government pretend that there is little or nothing which can be done to solve it. Even the creation of an environment which will ensure jobs are provided in the private sector has not succeeded in solving the problem. Like other speakers, I believe the new initiative announced by the Government in the budget will not solve this problem, as the private sector will have to top up the Government subsidy in order to create jobs. No private sector company are prepared to do that at present as they do not see any return in profits or, at times, any future for themselves. I hope there will be a change in emphasis by the Government in this area.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the social employment scheme introduced by my colleague Deputy Ruairí Quinn when he was Minister. This scheme did not solve all the problems but it created an atmosphere which enable people to come off the dole queues and become involved in non-profit enterprises run by local authorities and communities. The Minister has indicated that he is reducing the number of participants in that scheme by 50 per cent. I regret this decision as county councils and community groups will not be able to carry on the work done by people on this scheme as they do not have the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ahearn said, schools for the physically and mentally handicapped will suffer as a result of the reduction in funding for the Teamwork scheme. The workshops run by the mentally handicapped will also suffer from the reduction in funding for retraining. The Minister for Labour, the Minister for Education or the Minister for Health will have to accept responsibility for ensuring that those workshops, which create sheltered employment for people who are handicapped and disabled, continue in existence. <Col N="1521" /> It will be a tragedy if these workshops are closed.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the unemployment crisis can be solved by waving a magic wand or that a solution can be found overnight. That would be a dishonest contention for anyone to make. Even the Government Deputies who have contributed to the debate have said that they do not think there is a magic solution to the problem. We need to work together to resolve the problem. If we can provide jobs for some of the 300,000 people who are unemployed at least people will see that we are making an effort to solve the problem. A previous Taoiseach said that an unemployment level of 100,000 was unacceptable. If this is so, an unemployment level of 300,000 must be most unacceptable to all of us. All parties in this House need to work together to convince the unemployed that we are committed to addressing the unemployment crisis.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be very brief so as to ensure that as many Deputies as possible will get an opportunity to contribute to this very important debate. I compliment the Minister for successfully intervening in the banks strike. As a rule I do not favour ministerial intervention in strikes, but obviously such action is necessary on occasion. I believe that at times strikes are prolonged in the hope of having ministerial involvement. This is totally and utterly wrong. This House has enacted all the necessary legislation to settle industrial disputes, and it should be used to the maximum extend by both sides in any dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister and the legislators have learned something from the recent bank dispute. The consequences should be kept in mind in preparation for any future legislation on <Col N="1522" /> industrial disputes. I hope that any animosity that may exist between staff and management will cease and that every effort will be made to establish a good, healthy working environment in our banks. I say this in the interests of the economic development of this nation.</P>
    <P>A new political response is now required. To that end it is important that we explore the fullest potential for working time initiatives, such as job sharing and part-time work. We are called by the jobs challenge to a renewed political commitment to ensure access to good jobs for our people. We should do so by strengthening our economy within the European Community. This requires the active and willing co-operation of all sectors of society. We need and shall value everybody's contribution &mdash; I would emphasise this &mdash; be it that of the person who is long term unemployed and undertakes a training programme, or that of the company board who search systematically for fresh investment opportunities in this country. The message must go out that we need everyone and each person must be facilitated in making the contribution of which he or she is capable.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment set up recently, I intend to dedicate my efforts and energy to seeking out people, especially those who are considered specialists in their own profession, the unemployed, trade unions, youth organisations and the many people who are willing to make a contribution to the success of the work of this jobs forum. The forum should have the co-operation of all parties, and each Member of the House should throw his or her full weight behind their work. The task is great but I have no doubt that with the co-operation of everybody something good will come from it. The message must go out that everybody's contribution is needed and I hope that this will be one of the important aspects of the forum.</P>
    <P>The committee have twin responsibilities, to explore every possible avenue of job creation, identifying obstacles to job growth which exist in our economy <Col N="1523" /> and to see how the huge numbers of unemployed can be assured of a meaningful role in society. The committee are determined to achieve these objectives and to ensure that positive results accrue.</P>
    <P>As we move through the nineties we should be keen to make it a decade in which, with determination, ingenuity and generosity, we finally tackle the twin evils of unemployment and emigration that have been endemic here. It should be a decade in which we are not seen to sit back, accept the continuation of these problems and let the country be shaped from outside. We should do the shaping ourselves. Finally, as I expressed at our recent conference in Waterford, the approach by everybody should be togetherness, confidence, which is very important because nothing can be achieved without first building up confidence in our people, and finally a determination by everybody to succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wyse in particular for his co-operation in allowing me some time to contribute to this very important debate. I have often been critical of his party in the past but I compliment him on his constructive approach today. I have often been critical of Deputy Fahey, from my own constituency, in the past about many matters, but his approach today was also constructive. Maybe now that he is released from his responsibilities as Minister he sees things differently. As Deputy Wyse has said, perhaps we should use the talents of all those people who have been recently released from their responsibilities. These people were very busy as Ministers but now that their responsibilities are not as great they have a vital contribution to make to improving the employment position. In Galway a body of retired people has been set up, people with much talent and experience to offer towards the creation of jobs. The last speaker from Fianna Fáil, Deputy Jacob, was very praiseworthy of the Minister for his intervention in the bank strike. I, too, compliment the Minister on his efforts in solving that strike and I appeal to him to <Col N="1524" /> use his undoubted talents to intervene in the post office strike. We will all support him in his efforts to do so.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael take the jobs problem seriously and we are devoting a special session of our Ard-Fheis on Saturday morning to the jobs forum. Every constituency has been asked to consider one aspect of the creation of jobs and the results of their report will be considered. This is a very serious matter and I am glad that in this debate constructive suggestions have been put forward. There are 280,000 people unemployed throughout the country, 14,000 of whom are in County Galway. The single biggest factor concerning parents at present is the lack of job opportunities for their children. Every public representative will be aware that about 1,000 applications are received for every job advertised. Before I came into the House I received a call from a mother requesting me to make representations for her daughter in the hope that she would get a job in a butcher's shop which is due to open next week in Galway. This girl is 23 years of age and has never been employed. She is so desperate that she would take a job washing the floors of the butcher's shop.</P>
      <P>Whenever clerk typist or clerical officer jobs are advertised by county councils and health boards about 1,000 applications are received. Even if people are successful they may have to go on a panel and wait for a job that may not be created in the coming year. This causes serious difficulty in the fabric of family life. Many children have never seen their parents working and this has a great effect on their mentality and on that of their families. Whatever can be done collectively to create jobs should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pay over £1 billion a year in unemployment assistance. There is no scarcity of work to be done. Perhaps we could use that £1 billion to pay people for work which needs to be done within communities. Every community could devise a project to create 20 or 30 jobs for one year. Instead of paying money in unemployment assistance we could pay people for meaningful work, giving them a little more than they would get in unemployment <Col N="1525" /> assistance. That would partly solve the problem. I am sorry I have not time to develop this subject further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed and for their constructive approach. This is my first opportunity to bring forward an Estimate for the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan said he did not see anything in my speech and could not associate with the philosophy of it. That is unfortunate because the whole tenor of the speech was about social partnership and the fact that we can only achieve progress and success through social partnership. Since 1987 when we institutionalised social partnership we have had considerable success. Of course the Opposition will criticise and say there should have been more success. It must be accepted that without social partnership the situation would be more serious.</P>
      <P>Only Deputy Hillery adverted to the context within which job creation can be achieved. We must have low inflation and a competitive economy in order to create jobs. Jobs are not created in a vacuum. The macro-economic policies which the Government, and their predecessors, have pursued since 1987 are working to a great extent. Without positive macro-economic indicators like low inflation, growing exports, a stable exchange rate policy and stability within the EMS, we can achieve nothing. We cannot revert to the policies of the early and mid-eighties. Eighty thousand fewer people were at work in 1987 than in 1982. There are more people at work now than there were in 1987, but the rate at which we are creating jobs is not meeting the demands of the labour market. We have the youngest population in Europe and on average, 25,000 people come on the labour market each year. There will be an increase of 2 per cent in the labour market annually towards the end of this decade and a major effort must be made to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to which Deputy Durkan referred does not in any way signal defeat on the jobs front. It is based on a realistic <Col N="1526" /> assessment and the realisation that within the European labour market there are opportunities for our people. If we are serious about European integration we must look to the European labour market opportunities in respect of those people who may wish to avail of them. That does not amount to a negative approach. Young people want to travel and experience other cultures and economies. We must facilitate them and put mechanisms in place through FÁS which can identify areas where they can get work commensurate with their qualifications. In the past voluntary and involuntary emigrants have not obtained the sort of jobs one would expect, based on their qualifications.</P>

      <P>Is this our idea of Dáil <Col N="1528" /> reform? I will now deal with some points raised by Deputy Ryan. Of course ports are the life blood of the trading economy. They are to us what motorways are to our continental partners. They need improvement, investment and modernisation and they need new work practices. This issue was addressed in the Culliton report and the Government will address the issue of providing modern port management and infrastructure in that context, including the issues of control and ownership. Several highly publicised disputes have been mentioned. It is important to remember that these relate to structural problems, changes that are necessary for continued viability of the bodies involved. Everyone is afraid of change. It is not on pay issues that these disputes have arisen but rather the need to change and modernise and to gear up for the integrated market. That is most important. If everybody could keep their eye on that basic issue there would be some hope of resolving the disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We realise that this is the core of the problem but can these difficult aspects not be resolved across the table? Why do we have to allow a dispute to continue for perhaps two months before we resolve it? The Minister must bring the parties together and resolve these disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The machinery is available to both parties. There is some idea that ministerial intervention <i>per se</i> resolves a dispute. That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a mutual disposition to deal with the issues in dispute and negotiate a solution to the core problem. There is no point in reaching a settlement which does not deal with the problem. It is in everybody's interest in terms of maintaining existing jobs and the continued viability of these agencies that we deal with these problems, difficult though they are. There is no easy route <Col N="1529" /> out of our difficulties. I understand the difficulties both sides have, but at the end of the day they must negotiate a settlement that resolves the core issues. The idea that intervention, ministerial or otherwise, will solve the problem is not very helpful. However, I know that it has not been suggested in an unhelpful way.</P>
      <P>It is important that we keep our eye on the ball in regard to where the problems are and how they are to be resolved. The Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court have the expertise and far-reaching experience and they can assist people in resolving disputes. Last year the Labour Relations Commission dealt with 1,800 disputes and they had an 86 per cent success rate in resolving strikes. This shows that the system works.</P>
      <P>Deputies have spoken about a crisis in industrial relations, but I think we should not overstate the position. Of course, this is an unwelcome trend. The highly publicised disputes have given rise to an increase in the figures, but we should remember that we are comparing our present figures with excellent figures during the period of industrial peace over the past few years. In the seventies and eighties we had serious problems. We should take what is positive and build on it. The commitment of the social partners to the process of social partnership is just as strong now as in the past despite the difficulties that arise now and again in relation to disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">

      <P>The trouble is that it appeared the Minister took credit publicly for solving the bank dispute. That is what is misleading Deputies about the current postal dispute. If the Minister had not taken credit for solving the bank dispute it would not be expected that he would do something about the postal dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that I nail this matter on the head. If Deputies look at the statements I made on the bank dispute they will find that I probably made the shortest statement of all when it was eventually settled. There is no question of politicising disputes. Let me <Col N="1530" /> suggest to Deputy McCormack that there is no benefit for him, me or anybody else in seeking to politicise what is a trade dispute. If we maintain that professional basis, we have some possibility of settling it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £51,056,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of <Col N="1531" /> payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1992, for retired pay, pensions, compensation, allowances and gratuities payable under sundry statutes to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces and certain other Military Organisations, etc., and for sundry contributions and expenses in connection therewith; for certain extra-statutory children's allowances and for sundry grants.</P>
    <P>The Defence Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1992 is for a gross provision of £345.8 million &mdash; an increase of more than £3 million on the figure for 1991. The major part of the 1992 Estimate &mdash; 83 per cent, or £271.5 million &mdash; provides for pay and allowances and this represents an increase of £2.6 million on the outturn for 1991. The non-pay items amount to £74.3 million; and the provision of £19.5 million for Appropriations-in-Aid shows an increase of over £2 million on the 1991 outturn.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for 1992 is based on an average total strength of 12,990 in the Permanent Defence Force comprising 1,575 officers, 65 cadets and 11,350 other ranks and provides for the annual training of approximately 9,000 FCA and Slua Muirí personnel.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Estimate I feel I should make some comment on the question of defence in the context of the Treaty on European Union. Ireland's traditional position of remaining outside military alliances is recognised by a specific provision in section J of the Treaty which states that the policy of the European Union in the security area &ldquo;shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states&rdquo;. The Treaty does not set up a common defence policy and it contains no mutual defence commitments whatsoever. Conscription cannot be imposed on Ireland through the Treaty and it is pure nonsense to suggest &mdash; as has been suggested &mdash; that it can.</P>
    <P>The Treaty provides that an Inter-governmental Conference in 1996 may <Col N="1532" /> consider the framing of a common defence policy. Any new agreement in this area must be unanimous and would have to be ratified by a referendum. Accordingly, the position of Ireland is completely safeguarded.</P>
    <P>A major development in the Defence Forces in the last year has been the establishment of two representative associations &mdash; RACO representing officers and PDFORRA representing NCOs and Privates. Since the establishment of the associations the representative structures provided for in the relevant Defence Force Regulations and in the arrangements drawn up in agreement between my Department and the associations have been developed.</P>
    <P>The associations have each selected two members who will be seconded to them at State expense to act as full time officials. I would like to congratulate the individuals involved and wish them well in their new appointments. I recently met a deputation from each association and was able to hear at first hand their various concerns.</P>
    <P>During the week PDFORRA held its first ever Annual Delegate Conference in Galway and I had the pleasure of addressing the delegates. In addition, the Chief of Staff was invited to the conference and was also afforded the opportunity of addressing it.</P>
    <P>Regular meetings now take place between the representatives of the associations and representatives &mdash; civil and military &mdash; of my Department and, where appropriate, the Department of Finance. In addition, meetings between representatives of the associations and the appropriate military authorities at barrack and command levels are also held. As a result of such discussions many issues have been resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    <P>During the Oireachtas debates on the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, a commitment was given to provide a system of conciliation and arbitration for the Permanent Defence Force on the basis of the system which obtains in the public service generally. In line with this commitment a process of consultation <Col N="1533" /> with both representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, who will be parties to the scheme, is already well under way. Discussions on the terms of the scheme are continuing and a very considerable measure of progress has been made.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say, therefore, that the representative arrangements are, generally speaking, developing in a satisfactory manner and I wish to pay tribute both to the association representatives and the departmental representatives, civil and military, for the remarkable progress that has been made in the short period of time since the establishment of the associations in developing the new representative initiative. The House will note that it was the first annual meeting of PDFORRA that I addressed yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, also provides for representative structures for members of the Reserve Defence Force. My predecessor met with interested personnel of the Reserve Defence Force last year. Representatives of my Department have had a number of meetings with a delegation from the FCA and the Slua Muirí to discuss this matter in greater detail. The meetings are being held in an atmosphere of goodwill. I anticipate that the representative arrangements will be finalised in the very near future and the Defence Force Regulations to make statutory provision for these arrangements will then be signed by me.</P>
    <P>Since 1969 one to the main preoccupations of the Defence Forces has been with internal security matters. Primary responsibility for internal security rests with the Garda Síochána and the involvement of the Defence Forces derives from their role of rendering aid to the civil power.</P>
    <P>Almost 10,000 military parties were supplied during the past 12 months in the Border area, in response to requests from the Garda. Throughout the State, 1,000 parties were supplied to provide security for the movement and use of explosives in blasting operations. One hundred and sixty two requests were received for <Col N="1534" /> bomb disposal teams. Over 2,800 military escorts were provided, including escorts for cash in transit and civilian prisoners.</P>
    <P>Discussions have been initiated with a view to securing from the banks a contribution of £2 million &mdash; £1.5 million for Defence and £0.5 million for the Department of Justice &mdash; towards the cost of cash escorts.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Permanent Defence Force is making a significant contribution in the cause of international peace by way of the participation in a number of United Nations peace-keeping missions. We have an Irish contingent of about 750 all ranks serving with the United Nations in the Interim Force in Lebanon, eight personnel serving in staff appointments with the United Nations Force in Cyprus and in addition, there are approximately 60 Irish officers serving as observers with various United Nations missions in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Cambodia, Iraq-Kuwait, Angola, Western Sahara, Yugoslavia and in Central America. Three Irish Army officers are serving with the European Community task force for Food Aid To Russia and a further six officers and one non-commissioned officer are serving with the EC monitor mission to Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Last March I visited the Middle East, including Lebanon, Cyprus and Syria. I spent four days with the Irish contingent serving with UNIFIL visiting 23 locations and saw at first hand the conditions under which Irish troops operate. I was greatly impressed by their sense of commitment to the important work which they are undertaking in the cause of international peace and by the great rapport which exists between them and the local communities. I had reason to have discussions with the Muktar of the local villages and this rapport was very evident from what the village leaders said to me. The morale of the troops was very high. I am satisfied that the presence of UNIFIL is vital to the stability of South Lebanon and affords protection and humanitarian assistance to the local population, who appealed strongly to me for the continued presence of Irish troops in South Lebanon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> The Government remain firmly committed to supporting United Nations peacekeeping missions. All of the military personnel concerned &mdash; it is important to stress this &mdash; volunteer to serve overseas with the United Nations and I wish to place on record the Government's appreciation of the vital contribution to peace made by Irish military personnel. I also wish to congratulate Major-General Michael Minehane on his recent appointment as Force Commander of the United Nations Force in Cyprus and wish him every success in his new appointment. As Force Commander of UNFICYP he has personnel from Austria, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, as well as from Ireland, under his command.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years, the pay of Defence Force personnel has been increased considerably and increases due in 1992 under the modified terms of the agreement on pay and conditions associated with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will be applied to the Defence Forces. Provision for these increases will be made in the Estimate for Increases in Remuneration and Pensions. The starting pay of a recruit is now over £150 a week. After four years' service as Private 3 star, his gross pay including military service allowance is over £256 a week. Since the beginning of 1989, the average pay of a Private and NCO has increased by between 45 per cent and 50 per cent. In addition, a variety of allowances is payable to officers and men who perform duties of a security nature. Examples of typical gross taxable earnings for the tax year 1991-92 were: Private 3 star &mdash; £14,000 a year or £270 a week; Corporal £16,000 a year or over £300 a week; and Captain &mdash; £22,000 a year. These amounts do not include overseas allowance and other non-taxable payments. Increases payable from 1 January 1992 under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are not included.</P>
    <P>Competitions for the award of cadetships in the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service were recently advertised. The successful candidates will commence <Col N="1536" /> training next October. A competition for the award of apprenticeships in various trades for the Army and Naval Service was advertised earlier this year. The apprentices will be enlisted in August next. At present 24 NCOs are undergoing a potential officers' course at the Military College Curragh Camp. The successful participants will be commissioned as officers of the Permanent Defence Forces next month.</P>

    <P>As regards the Reserve Defence Force, annual training for the FCA and the Slua Muirí at the same level as in recent years will be held this year and the full annual gratuity will be paid. The position with regard to training will continue to be kept under review. I wish to express the Government's appreciation for the work of members of the reserve who give such a fine example of good citizenship to the youth of the country. I should mention in passing that I had the pleasure of commissioning FCA officers in Galway recently and commended them on their service to the country and keeping up a tradition of citizen soldiers which goes back a long way.</P>
    <P>With a budget of £399 million for the Defence and Army Pensions Votes and <Col N="1537" /> a total payroll of almost 14,500, including civilian employees, the Defence Forces constitute a major organisation in both manpower and financial terms. Recent developments in the area of information technology provide greatly increased scope for the use of computers in the defence area. To harness the benefits of these technical advances, a major strategic information plan, covering all areas of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, has been adopted and implementation is well under way.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1990, a contract for the supply and installation of the computer equipment required to implement the first phase of the plan was signed. Initial deliveries of equipment were made in 1991 and over £1.7 million is provided in this year's Estimate for a further instalment of computer equipment. It is anticipated that substantial savings in the area of administration will result from the programme of computerisation, particularly in the areas of purchasing and inventory control.</P>
    <P>In regard to fishery surveillance, an EC funding package covering expenditure incurred between 1991 and 1995 was approved for member states in November 1989. In accordance with these arrangements a programme was agreed with the EC and a contract was placed in April 1991 for the purchase of two new CASA CN 235 maritime patrol aircraft for delivery in early 1994 and an interim CASA CN 235 which was delivered last year. Fifty per cent of the expenditure will be refunded by the European Community.</P>
    <P>The protection of our maritime resources is a priority for the Naval Service. This involves all seven Naval Service vessels in patrols throughout the fishing grounds within Ireland's 200 mile limit, frequently in quite challenging conditions. In addition, since late 1991, a Dauphin helicopter has operated from LE <i>Eithne</i> on fishery protection surveillance activities. While aboard LE <i>Eithne</i>, the Dauphin is used to extend the surveillance range of the ship and to search out and locate fishing vessels to determine the legality of their activities. <Col N="1538" /> This arrangement has proved very effective and has assisted in the detention of illegal fishing vessels. Naval personnel are fully deserving of our appreciation for the professionalism and dedication with which the task of fishery protection is performed.</P>
    <P>There have been important developments in the area of search and rescue. A Dauphin helicopter has been positioned at Finner since July 1991 for search and rescue operations in the north-west and the heli-pad facilities there have been improved. A contract SAR helicopter service has been put in place at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Since their acquisition, the Dauphin helicopters have flown more than 400 search and rescue missions, as a result of which more than 200 people were rescued. I want to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation, and that of the Government, for the excellent job which the Air Corps are doing in the search and rescue role.</P>
    <P>As regards the maintenance and improvement of military posts, a provision of £8 million is made in Subhead V of the Estimate for building and engineering works both for new construction projects and for the refurbishment of existing buildings to meet the needs of Army personnel. A total of £4.5 million of this provision is earmarked for capital investment. A large proportion of this amount will be devoted to works required in connection with the evacuation of Collins Barracks, Dublin. These include works in McKee Barracks &mdash; a new dining complex, renovation of billet blocks and a new building maintenance facility. In Cathal Brugha Barracks, the works include the completion of the new central armoury, a new headquarters for the Eastern Command, a new dining hall complex and a new supply and transport facility.</P>
    <P>Other major new works to commence in 1992 are the fitting shop, naval base, Haulbowline and a search and rescue building in Finner Camp. A programme for the improvement of existing billets is continuing, as well as major maintenance and health and safety works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> Another special departmental programme is the Asgard sail training scheme. A full programme of cruises for <i>Asgard II</i> has been planned for 1992. These cruises will cater for some 580 trainees, mainly in the age group 16 to 20 years of age. Last year was a very successful year. The <i>Asgard II</i>, its crew and trainees succeeded for the first time in securing the Cutty Sark Trophy, which is awarded to a ship participating in the annual Tall Ships Race.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce a major change in the status of women in the Defence Forces. I have made a decision in principle to end the restrictions which prevent women from serving in all areas of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Women were enlisted into the Defence Forces in 1980 and at present, there are 111 female military personnel. The range of appointments open to women has been expanded in recent years to include Army and Air Corps apprenticeships and Air Corps cadetships. However, because of their status as non-combatants, women have been restricted in the duties allocated to them. For example, women serving in the Army have not undertaken security duties in aid of the civil power.</P>
    <P>I have recently received the report of a board which was convened in September 1991 to consider expanding the role of women in the Defence Forces. The board, which included a male civilian and two women, concluded that the policy of limiting women to a non-combatant role should be discontinued. They recommended the full participation of women over a period of time in all aspects of Defence Forces activity, to include participation in operational work; the full integration of women in relation to access to the military career educational system and to promotional opportunity in the Defence Forces and a transitional period to plan and implement the recommendations of the board.</P>
    <P>I have considered the conclusion and recommendations of the board, which have been endorsed by the military authorities, and have approved the broad thrust of their findings. I am instructing <Col N="1540" /> the military authorities to engage in the detailed planning necessary to ensure the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>With regard to Civil Defence, the Minister of State will deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Army Pensions Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1992. The Estimate is for a net sum of £51,056,000 representing an increase of £1,606,000 or 3 per cent on the 1991 outturn. The bulk of expenditure from the Estimate falls under subhead E1, which covers pensions and gratuities granted under the Defence Forces pensions schemes to former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants. This item accounts for 80 per cent of the total Estimate with approximately 6,500 pensioners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>All pensions and allowances are being increased from 1 January and 1 December 1992, in line with the pay increases from those dates under the modified terms of the agreement on pay and conditions associated with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> In line with similar arrangements applicable elsewhere in the public service, retirement gratuities and other once-off lump sum payments are being increased from 1 January 1992, as if the full pay increase due under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> had been paid from that date. Moreover, the full 3 per cent increase is being applied from 1 January to the pensions and allowances payable to veterans of the War of Independence and the dependants of deceased veterans. Provision for these increases will be made in the Estimate for increases in remuneration and pensions.</P>
      <P>I commend both Estimates to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one <Col N="1541" /> element of the Minister's speech that I welcome, that regular meetings are taking place between the representative associations and the civil and military authorities, his Department and the Department of Finance. It is very important that they would have regular meetings with the Department of Finance because the Estimate before us is not adequate to provide proper remuneration or, indeed, proper facilities, to the military right across the country.</P>
      <P>In addressing the Defence Estimate we must ask what will be the future role for the Defence Forces. The fact that a number of the recommendations of Gleeson Commission have been addressed is not evidence of implementing the spirit and substance of the report of that group.</P>
      <P>At present there is widespread dissatisfaction and low morale, and a feeling of dejection is rampant among the Defence Forces. In addition, there is a belief that there is lack of interest and commitment on the part of the Department and a sense of being exploited because of their statutory status.</P>
      <P>That must not be allowed to continue. The onus is on the Minister, and his Department, to publish a White Paper outlining the role and function of the Defence Forces, proposals for improved management structures, details of planned improvements in accommodation and facilities and proper and adequate remuneration for all ranks within the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I hope that Ireland will participate more closely in European affairs after the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. It is interesting to note that the Minister stated that Ireland's position has been safeguarded. I would like to ask the Minister what is meant by &ldquo;safeguarded&rdquo;? Is it in our interests to opt out of a closer defence union in Europe and will it safeguard our interests? This matter must be addressed but not in the way the Minister dealt with it in the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this matter be addressed because, as we are all aware, the question of a common defence policy will be considered by an inter-governmental <Col N="1542" /> conference in 1996. In view of this it is vital that both the Department of Defence and the military authorities draw up a discussion document on the future role of the Irish Army within Europe and in particular within the United Nations. If we address these issues now we will invigorate the Defence Forces, give them a sense of purpose, a <i>raison d'etre</i> and a renewed standing within the community. It is important that the Minister and the Department address this matter as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In relation to the management of the forces, great concern has been expressed in recent times. The traditional dogmatic and authoritarian management of the forces is outdated and unacceptable. There is a need, therefore, to adopt a proper personnel management system. Concern was expressed recently about promotions and this should not be voiced in the future. An adequate annual assessment report should be drawn up on each member of the Defence Forces and should be made available to the person concerned. It should also be made available retrospectively. Given that this assessment will be placed before the promotions board it is important that candidates for promotion have access to information contained in the file. The present system whereby performances are monitored subjectively is not satisfactory. A proper system should be put in place.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that personnel receive training in management skills so that all candidates are afforded a fair opportunity of promotion. Given the over-supply of commandants in the Army at present there are difficulties in relation to promotions in the Army, Navy and Air Corps. It is important, therefore, that the matter be addressed quickly. A capping system should be introduced to enable the authorities to implement fully the recommendations contained in the Gleeson report. Because such a capping system has not been introduced many people are restricted to the one rank with no possibility of promotion in the years to come. In the past captains were promoted <Col N="1543" /> to the rank of commandant between the ages of 33 and 38 whereas now the average age lies between the ages of 44 and 48. The matter needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The inhuman practice of transferring military personnel, in some cases with less than 24 hours notice, must be stopped, in particular where they are not made for specific operational purposes. A proper explanation should be given and the case substantiated. Recently a number of officers were transferred from one battalion to another with less than 24 hours notice. No explanation was given and upheaval was caused for their families. This is unacceptable and it should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In relation to special allowances, about which we have heard so much in recent days, soldiers engaged in operational duties in Border areas feel that they are being discriminated against. They receive a sum of £37.85, before tax, per week. Most soldiers do at least two 24-hour stints each week. Indeed, some soldiers do as many as four 24-hour stints in a week. Despite this they still receive only £37.85. This is grossly unfair having regard to the fact that members of the Garda, the civil power, whom they are assisting receive very lucrative allowances, and rightly so. It is important, therefore, that this discrepancy be rectified immediately. Regardless of whether a soldier does four 24-hour stints or works right throughout the weekend he still receives only £37.85. The Minister should address this problem immediately.</P>
    <P>At the conference in Galway during the week the Minister stated that this matter could be addressed in two ways: first, by employing more soldiers in operational duties and, second, by reducing the number involved in the administrative services. This proposal is not adequate and will not overcome the difficulty that exists at present. It is important that the Minister should seek additional finance from the Minister for Finance to remunerate the soldiers engaged in such duties properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> It is equally important that the Minister launch a new recruiting campaign to recruit more people into the Army. This matter should be addressed seriously as a matter of urgency. In addressing this issue consideration must be given to the upheaval caused for families, the unsocial hours worked and the disruption experienced by the spouses and children of these soldiers. It is proving difficult to draft soldiers from battalions in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway to take part in operational duties along the Border. As a result, those soldiers stationed permanently along the Border have to carry responsibility for a number of weeks after the arrival of other soldiers who are unfamiliar with the region.</P>
    <P>We are all proud of our troops involved in UN peacekeeping duties overseas yet the Government pay the lowest allowances of all participating nations. I ask the Minister to address this issue and to put the overseas allowances on a par with the allowances payable by some of our European counterparts. This situation must not be allowed continue.</P>
    <P>In relation to pensions, there is a difficulty with widow's pensions in particular. A few hundred women find themselves in a difficult position because their spouses opted out of the scheme when they got an opportunity to do so ten to 15 years ago. Numerous appeals have been made in the House during the years to have this matter rectified as a matter of urgency and I appeal to the Minister, once again, to rectify this discrepancy as it is a source of serious concern for many women.</P>
    <P>At present pensioners are experiencing difficulties due to the postal dispute. Despite the Minister's efforts to make alternative arrangements hardship is being caused for a number of pensioners. I ask the Minister to provide a delivery service through the Army for those pensioners suffering hardship at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the status of women within the Defence Forces. I welcome his statement that he has made a decision in principle to remove the restrictions to allow women serve in all areas of the Defence Forces. While I <Col N="1545" /> welcome this decision I urge him to act quickly. I should say, however, that I have not been impressed by the cumbersome way in which he has tried to implement his decision. This is a fairly straightforward matter of allowing women to partake in all military activities. At present they are not allowed to engage in security duties and this is unacceptable. Neither are they allowed to participate in peacekeeping activities overseas.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter because they are being discriminated against and their prospects of promotion in the future are being hindered. That is the nub of the issue. While this situation is allowed to continue they will find it difficult to be promoted within the Army. I appeal, therefore, to the Minister to forget about the cumbersome machinery that he is suggesting and to get on with the job. It is a straightforward matter of lifting the ban that exists and allowing women to do the job that they could do effectively.</P>
    <P>Repeatedly, in classes for cadets and regular soldiers female participants have excelled themselves and indeed have taken first, second and third prizes in many instances within their respective classes. It is totally unacceptable that because of restrictions their abilities are being further stifled. I am concerned that the machinery which the Minister proposes will be a further delaying tactic in regard to that issue.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous skills and abilities in the Army, but previous Ministers and Governments have not tapped them. There is a possibility of the Army generating finance and the Minister should look at ways of doing so. In his speech he addressed the various work which the Army do in relation to security, and the security provided by the Army to the banks is a particular area of concern to the public. I urge the Minister to secure moneys fairly quickly from the banks for the type of security provided by the Army for the transfer of money across the country from bank to bank.</P>
    <P>The Army have a great tradition of peacekeeping activities in the United Nations and have served throughout the <Col N="1546" /> world in that capacity. They are renowned for the manner in which they conduct that kind of work and we have an opportunity of setting up a United Nations training school where our skills and expertise would be provided to other nations who now want to participate in United Nations peacekeeping activities. The Army could generate finance by putting this in place. It is laudable that so many Eastern European and African countries want to participate in United Nations activities. There is an opening in that regard and we should be ready to avail of it. The ordnance school are doing great work in relation to bomb disposal and we are training Army personnel from other countries in that area.</P>
    <P>The Navy are a very important element of our Defence Forces and their primary job is fishery protection. I welcome the fact that the <i>LE Eithne</i> has the Dauphin helicopter which was promised at the end of last year. However, there is a problem in that regard because the <i>LE Eithne</i> and other naval vessels were commanded by captains for quite a considerable length of time when the post should have been equivalent to the rank of commandant in the Army. Because of the overall situation in relation to promotions, the Navy in particular has been discriminated against. I ask the Minister to address the aspect of promotions, because the Navy are doing a very fine job. Indeed, since they received the helicopter they have done an even more effective job in relation to fisheries protection. Our search and rescue service was updated recently as a result of a medium range helicopter being stationed at Shannon. It is being served by the Air Corps from Cork, Finner and Galway and they are providing a very fine service. The Minister should examine other areas in relation to additional work they may be able to do and in regard to training facilities which they may be able to provide to the public.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other relevant issues but they will be raised by my colleagues. However, I wish to refer to the FCA, a voluntary organisation operating right across the country. Over the years <Col N="1547" /> they have provided a fine service, but unfortunately in recent times recruitment to the FCA has been considerably reduced because of lack of money. The facilities, clothes and opportunities for training provided to FCA personnel have diminished considerably, which is extremely unfortunate. I appeal to the Minister to look again at the future of the FCA and to define a particular role for them. Indeed, their responsibilities should be extended because they have acted as a fine back-up service to the regular Army in the past and there is an opportunity for an additional role for them in future.</P>
    <P>The position at present is not encouraging young men and women to join. The training camps which were provided in the past do not now exist. It is unfortunate that some of the training camps traditionally used by the FCA have been closed down in some instances or utilised much less in recent years. If I may be parochial, I refer in particular to Lahinch training camp, which was used for only two weeks last year whereas normally it would have been used for six weeks. Will the Minister address that matter in his reply and give an assurance that it will be used for six weeks in the coming season and upgraded and refurbished as required?</P>
    <P>Civil Defence is a very important area and my colleague will refer to it later. It plays a very important role within the community and I am sure the Minister will expand on this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish on behalf of the Labour Party to pay tribute to our <Col N="1548" /> Defence Forces for their work, dedication and duty throughout the years. Since the foundation of the State Irishmen and women in the service of their country at home and abroad have done a remarkably fine job despite financial constraints. They have an outstanding record of success, particularly in the service of the United Nations, and some paid the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives in the cause of peace. Their sacrifice, and the loss to their loved ones, must never be forgotten. The success of our forces in the Congo, Cyprus, the Lebanon and other trouble spots around the world did not happen overnight; it is as a result of proven Army training and techniques which have been built up over the years and now form part of the tradition of our Defence Forces. Those traditions and invaluable expertise have made an impact on the world stage, an impact far greater than the size of the force and the population of our country warrants. This success, whether in the Middle East or around our coast, makes the nation proud of their achievements.</P>
      <P>For the Defence Forces to be efficient and effective adequate funding must be allocated by the Department so that this vital arm of Government can function properly. Unfortunately, over the years there has been a tendency by various Governments to treat Defence as a secondary Department and their spending was kept to a minimum. The role of the Army in Irish life has been seen by various Governments, and the public, as a force which is a back-up to the civilian service in times of public crises such as strikes or as a support force to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to take our Defence Forces seriously we must examine our objective in having an armed force. We must compare the spending and the preparedness of this country with those of other neutral countries in Europe, and if that question were examined fairly Ireland would certainly come well down the league table. Ireland has a history of under-investment in the Defence Forces, even though in the past few years considerable expenditure has been made. That expenditure has come about through necessity and due <Col N="1549" /> to years of neglect and inactivity by the Government.</P>
    <P>Today's Army is on constant alert and can be called on as a back-up service to the Garda, particularly along the Border. Very often Army personnel put in long, tedious hours of guard duty against the threat of subversives. Those personnel carry a huge responsibility, they are fully trained and armed and they are expected to carry out dangerous duties. We must ask ourselves whether they are being properly compensated. I suggest, as has been stated at this week's PDFORRA conference, that they are not. Army personnel carry out payroll security duties, the transportation of prisoners and prison duties. Again I ask: are they being adequately compensated? In fact, I shall go further and say that their treatment is disgraceful and needs to be remedied urgently. If the Army carry out the same duties and work the same hours as the Garda they should be paid accordingly. As long as pay structures differ substantially there is a genuine grievance on the part of the Defence Forces in relation to conditions and pay.</P>
    <P>Let us for a moment examine the present conditions of Army personnel. The vast majority of accommodation in the Defence Forces goes back to a different era. Many of the barracks and installations date back to Victorian times. I would venture to say that if British crown forces were to return to this country they would see no great change from the conditions at the time they left. Army personnel still have very poor quality and badly maintained accommodation and living quarters, as has been articulated very clearly in the past few days at the PDFORRA conference. The Minister would be very foolish to ignore the legitimate demands being made. The unsatisfactory conditions have developed through many years and this state of affairs again demonstrates the standing of the Defence Forces within the Government's priorities. Workers in State and private employment have had their conditions improved substantially through the years &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; and there is no reason that Army personnel should <Col N="1550" /> be discriminated against. It is my contention that due to regulations, discipline and loyalty &mdash; and I emphasise loyalty &mdash; within the Defence Forces advantage has been taken of their position. A classic illustration of that is the fact that the naval base at Spike Island was deemed satisfactory for naval personnel but had to be upgraded before being occupied by prisoners, and in that regard I am not talking about the security aspect.</P>
    <P>There is a serious lack of recreational facilities in many locations throughout the country. Because of financial constraints, I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of the provisions of joint facilities between local community groups and the Defence Forces. The gymnasium in Collins Barracks in Cork, for instance, which was burnt down some years ago, could very well be a particular instance in which the community and the Defence Forces would co-operate to provide much needed facilities.</P>
    <P>There is also an acceptance that the Haulbowline naval base has particularly poor facilities, again due to a lack of funding. That is the primary base for naval operations and should get priority. We cannot encourage and expect young naval ratings to learn skills and live in an environment that would not be tolerated by other Government agencies such as FÁS.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Naval Service on their splendid record of fishery protection. In the past large numbers of foreign trawlers have been arrested and brought to justice. While that work is essential, I believe that it should be secondary to the role of the Naval Service. We are an island nation, but that realisation is certainly not reflected in the approach of the Department of Defence to the Naval Service. It is extremely difficult for the Naval Service to operate as an independent service when they have to contend with other Government Departments such as the Department of the Marine and the Department of the Environment. We must seriously ask what the Naval Service have as their objective and primary role as we move towards the year 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> Again I suggest that a much more positive role could be played by the Naval Service in the protection of our territorial waters and in the operation of a much more effective coastguard service. I do not in any way wish to impinge on the duties of the Revenue Commissioners customs officers as presently constituted, but there is a serious gap in the service as operated at present. This country has a long tradition of neutrality. Our merchant marine braved the Atlantic and German U-boats during World War II to bring vital raw materials to this country. Yes, we are a neutral country but we are not neutral against crime. We as a nation must take steps to curtail the importation of lethal drugs into this country, a matter now of serious concern to our security forces. Recent statements made by security forces have indicated that the south and south-west coastline in particular are now often used by boats coming in close to the shore at a remote spot and unloading illicit drugs. I believe the Naval Service have a role to play in that regard. In conjunction with customs officials, they can and must play a much more active role in curbing the activities of the drug barons who get rich on the misery of others.</P>
    <P>Last year the House passed legislation on sea pollution and laid down regulations and conditions; regulations that, I hasten to say, would be very difficult to enforce under present naval operations. The Naval Service should be involved in environmental protection duties and should play a very active role in tracking down polluters of our waters and coastline and provide an inshore coastguard service able to detect the illegal importation of arms and drugs.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a need to examine who should have responsibility for the Naval Service and to consider the possibility of the Department of the Marine taking over responsibility for the Naval Service. That issue should be open for debate so that we may determine which body would be the most effective in directing the operations of the Service.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain, that the Naval <Col N="1552" /> Service, who are making a first-class response to their present duties are under-funded and have antiquated installations and accommodation. What is needed is a thorough reappraisal of this service, who are responsible for the needs of an island nation through the 1990s in peace and in war time.</P>
    <P>Increased funding for infrastructural development and a greater number of vessels are required to meet this nation's needs. The legislation on the Statute Book is not worth the paper on which it is written if the relevant authorities, such as the Naval Service, do not have the resources necessary to enforce that legislation. At present the resources are not there. It is a fact that Irish naval vessels have more seagoing operations per man and per unit than have most European navies but that fact is not always recognised. There is an urgent need to increase our naval fleet to meet the challenge of the future and to recruit more young naval ratings into the service. Ireland has a proven tradition in fishery protection and other naval duties. The more we recruit into the service the more effective we can be, particularly in view of the extra European Community waters we are now asked to patrol. We have about 16 per cent of Community waters. It is now necessary to seek funding abroad in order to combat illegal fishing activities around our coasts.</P>

      <P>Since I became Minister for Education I have received numerous requests for deputations with regard to school building projects.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating that a Minister, particularly a new Minister, is invariably inundated with requests for meetings, I am sure the Minister must realise that Jobstown Community College has 422 students attending there at present, that it is literally bursting at the seams, that there are 200 additional applications for entry next September and that phase 2 of the building project is ready to go, but that it cannot go. In view of the fact that Jobstown is an area of high unemployment it is unfair to impose the hardship on those children of asking them to go to other schools outside their area. I ask the Minister to meet the parents as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I am not unsympathetic to the Deputy's point and I understand the needs of the area. On 8 June 1989 the Minister agreed to go ahead with the purchase of the site and new accommodation was provided there for a total enrolment of more than 400 pupils. A meeting was held on 14 April with the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee. They are now seeking an additional 12 to 14 new classrooms. The Deputy will understand that the problem I face is that Brookfield, which is only one mile away, has accommodation for 1,000 pupils. Despite that only 504 pupils have enrolled. I have asked the planning section of my Department <Col N="1554" /> to closely monitor enrolment at both primary and post primary level in Jobstown and Brookfield. It is only at examination stage but, given those figures, I cannot give a commitment today.</P>

      <P>I will be happy to have some senior officials meet with them at this stage. I do not see much point in raising expectations. Since becoming Minister for Education I have tried to set my face against meeting deputations to take pressure off Deputies and to somehow pretend to the school that there was something the Minister had up his sleeve which, in fact, he had not. I do not wish to be discourteous. I will certainly arrange for senior officials to have a meeting with them immediately and I will consider the Deputy's request after that. I will not commit myself today because there is a school one mile away with a capacity for 1,000 and there are only 500 enrolled in it. The Department's professional analysis is that we could not commit ourselves to move any further than closely monitoring the enrolments. It is more honest to spell that out to the people than to delude them by pretending that a deputation to the Minister, with the equivalent number of pickets, can achieve the result, because it cannot.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention, nor would I regard it as appropriate, that my Department should take over full responsibility for the care of the mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of course the case that in so far as <Col N="1555" /> mentally handicapped children of schoolgoing age are concerned, my Department have a key role to play in their educational development. This role is exercised primarily through the special education system and involves a high degree of co-ordination with the relevant health authorities.</P>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services, commissioned by the Minister for Health, made a number of recommendations for increased co-ordination between the Departments of Health and Education in the provision of services for children with general learning difficulties. It did not recommend that all functions relating to the training and education of people with a mental handicap be taken over by the Minister for Education. The Department of Health, and my Department, have commenced discussions in relation to the educational aspects of provision for mentally-handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>In addition, the special education review committee, established by my predecessor, are to report and make recommendations on the educational provision for children with special needs, including those with mental handicap. A specific term of reference of that committee is to report on the linkages which should exist with other Departments and services provided under their aegis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Is the Minister aware of the great frustration and hardship inflicted on parents and the various societies looking after the mentally handicapped because of the conflict between the responsibility of the Departments of Health and Education? Is the Minister aware that there is often a buck-passing exercise between the Departments in which they disclaim responsibility? This problem would be alleviated if the Department of Education, for instance, were made entirely responsible for the educational needs of mentally handicapped children.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish it was that <Col N="1556" /> simple. I share the Deputy's concern that we should not subject the mentally handicapped to any bureaucracy. We should certainly stamp out the possibility of falling between two stools. As the Deputy knows, the Department of Education provide education services and the Department of Health provide medical and paramedical services through the health boards. It would be difficult for the Department of Education to provide medical or paramedical services, just as it would be difficult for the Department of Health to provide educational services. However, I am optimistic. Mr. Declan Brennan, a former distinguished Secretary of the Department of Education, is chairing a committee that has undertaken to report to me before the autumn. He has been specifically asked to examine the link between the Departments and how we might improve the co-ordination so that the children in question can get the best possible service. I share the Deputy's determination that lack of co-ordination between two key Departments should not affect the services to the mentally handicapped. An input from both Departments is needed, given the expertise required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister examine the provision of child care assistance to special classes in primary schools or to special schools? Often the Department of Education say it is a matter for the Department of Health and <i>vice versa.</i> I have not succeeded in getting to the bottom of this despite the fact that I have been spokesperson for my party on this subject for one year. Who is responsible for the provision of child care assistance for special classes in national schools? Are the Department of Health or the Department of Education responsible? Will somebody accept responsibility? Will the Minister look into that matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>I will certainly do that. I want to recommit myself to removing any lack of co-ordination or gap between Departments when it comes to the handicapped. I might remind the Deputy that in the introduction to the <Col N="1557" /> Green Paper which I published recently, I laid out six aims for the development of education. I placed as No. 1 on that list the tackling of the disadvantaged which comes right into this area. Therefore, I am as anxious as is the Deputy to stamp out any lack of co-ordination. I will encourage the Declan Brennan committee to let me have their recommendations as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The memorandum referred to by the Deputy is a Commission document which was presented to the Ministers for Education meeting in Council last November. Its purpose is to stimulate wide-ranging debate during 1992 within member states and at Community level. It does not attempt to lay down policy for the member states.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming Green Paper on Education will contain a major section on the development of higher education. The major themes covered in the Commission's memorandum will be dealt with. The wide-ranging debate which will follow publication of the Green Paper will, <i>inter alia</i>, provide a basis for a formal response to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have arranged with the Higher Education Authority to have the memorandum debated at a series of four seminars in September. One of these will deal with higher education and regional development. Thereafter, the Irish response to the memorandum will be furnished in the form of a report to the Commission. Similar action is being taken in other member states. The Commission will prepare a synthesis report to a future education council. At that point <Col N="1558" /> the question of implementing specific recommendations will arise.</P>

      <P>How many meetings has the Minister had with his European counterparts, the European Ministers for Education? When will the next meeting be held and has he established the Educational Secratariat in Brussels, as requested in our debate on the European Social Fund motion? Last but not least, does he not realise that the core philosophy contained in this document is about equal opportunity, access to all forms of education and that the move to withdraw 27,000 European Social Fund grants will have a disastrous effect in relation to achieving that ideal?</P>

      <P>I have had one formal meeting with my counterparts in the European Community at an informal Council of Education Ministers. However, there are almost daily contacts between my officials and officials of the other member states' Departments of Education.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's second question about the appointment of a person to the Education Secretariat in Brussels, my Department have selected an appropriate person and are at present clearing the necessary technicalities with the Department of Finance. Finally, in regard to the European Social Fund, I have made it clear that I am looking at the overall question of the level of higher education grants. The European Structural Fund means-testing decision will form part of that decision, about which I will have something to say, hopefully within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>After laying it before the Dáil, the Committee of Public Accounts formally request a response from the Accounting Officer if Secretary of the Department of Finance. He consults with the other Departments involved and prepares a response. The procedure is set out in the extract from Public Financial Procedures: An Outline.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts secretariat have confirmed that they have not formally requested a response from Department of Finance and will not be doing so for a fortnight or so.

For example, it was suggested that there was a serious omission by the Department of Education in not notifying University College, Dublin, of the £3.8 million valuation and a serious error of judgment in not obtaining a new valuation in December 1990; that the value for money exercise carried out by his Department is not sufficient; that the Department of Finance should have been consulted?

      <P>In the introduction to the education Green Paper which I published recently I indicated that Irish education must now educate young people to be European as well as Irish citizens. This will involve the development of an awareness of our European heritage and of the wider political and social framework of which we are now a part.</P>
      <P>I also stated that I will give much greater priority to learning European languages, and that special EC support will be sought for this. My emphasis will be on raising European language awareness of pupils in primary schools and on improving the practical use of languages at second level.</P>
      <P>As far as vocational education and training is concerned I propose to strengthen the vocational dimension at senior cycle within the framework of a unified leaving certificate by developing a broader base of technical subjects. I also propose to seek support for the extension of the leaving certificate vocational programme and for undergraduate courses in the universities.</P>
      <P>I confidently expect to get increased support from the EC for investment in the infrastructure of the education system and for the development of modern continental languages having regard to relevant Articles contained in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

It was the great protective umbrella used by two of his predecessors, Deputies O'Rourke and Davern when it was a case of &ldquo;Wrap the Green Paper round me boys&rdquo;. Now we are wrapping the introduction to the Green Paper around us. Will the Minister say positively when we will see this Green Paper on Education so that we can ascertain positively the measures about which he speaks? Also, as a matter of courtesy, may I be furnished with a copy of the introduction to the Green Paper on Education which, as far as I know, no Member of this House has yet received from the Minister?</P>

      <P>I published the introduction to the Green Paper on Education so that the teachers' conferences would be afforded an opportunity &mdash; in a short document &mdash; to ascertain the direction in which the Minister and Government were proposing to go. The Green Paper introduction ran to 125 pages, covering all the major subjects but did not give detail. More important than detail, it dealt with the philosophy and direction in which I was proposing to go. To my clear memory, one newspaper, <i>The Irish Times</i>, published the entire document. I am surprised the Deputy missed that. I regret not having forwarded the Deputy a copy. I did come across the Deputy at one or two conferences. I am surprised he did not manage to get his hands on the document that every teacher and everybody else in the country appears to have because I have been inundated by teachers and parents commenting on every aspect of that document. However, I am sure the Deputy can investigate his secretarial support in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to have the Green Paper on Education, which will flesh out the principles contained in the introduction, published before the end of May. It is my intention to introduce the White Paper before the end of this year and to proceed with the legislation in the early part of next year. That is the <Col N="1564" /> schedule I have set and I will do my best to stick to it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It may not be fair to refer to the Minister's introduction to the Green Paper as a leak, but it was a red herring used to distract the teachers at the congress. In view of the fact that German is becoming a very important language in Europe and a number of secondary schools are teaching it at present, does the Minister think that this language should be part of the teacher-training option since these colleges already have excellent French departments? Would the Minister be prepared to allocate funding to enable German departments to be set up in teacher training colleges?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction to the Green Paper sets out the dramatic initiatives to be undertaken in regard to languages. For example, I am in favour of giving 60 per cent of marks for the oral Irish examination and the remaining 40 per cent for the written examination. I am also in favour of awarding 60 per cent of the marks for the oral examinations in all other languages. This is a very dramatic and radical shift to the practical. I look forward during the debates and discussions which will take place over the next six months to finding out the level of support for this idea. I should say that even though we have expended much energy and enormous amounts of money on the teaching of Irish over many generations, unfortunately very few people can speak it fluently. I think the same could be said in regard to continental languages. I will encourage schools to teach German, French, Spanish and other continental languages. I am very interested in hearing the views of all partners in education, including the Deputy's party, on the dramatic shift to awarding 60 per cent of the marks for the oral examination and 40 per cent for the written examination.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply to Deputy Higgins, may I ask him whether he has approved the final <Col N="1565" /> text of the Green Paper and, if not, when he intends to do so?</P>
      <P>With regard to the European dimension of education and training, I wish to put it to the Minister that there is a very strong emphasis in European funding on training. One of the criticisms of the Minister's introduction to the Green Paper is that in his educational policy he seems to be following the training emphasis in the context of European funding rather than presenting an educational policy and seeking funding for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet approved the final text of the Green Paper. I have approved certain drafts of it and obviously I will approve the final document in time for it to be published by the end of May.</P>
      <P>With regard to the emphasis being placed on educational training, I recently made it clear that I have rejected the recommendation contained in the Culliton report in regard to vocational and academic education. Instead I have opted for a broad, comprehensive and unified leaving certificate which will embrace both academic and vocational training up to and including the leaving certificate stage.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, the European Community has tailored its funding and now places emphasis on vocational education and training to an enormous extent. We have to be careful in our choice of phraseology because we already carry out in our educational system much of the work regarded by continental countries as vocational education and training. Therefore, the definitions do not overlap neatly. Funding from the European Community is being used and will be used for both vocational and academic education in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the context of European integration and the need for the full involvement of Irish people in Europe we are way behind other European countries in terms of introducing a European language in primary schools? It has been estimated that the capacity of a pupil over the age of five years to absorb a new language is in decline. The European experience indicates that a second language should be taught to children of ten years of age, on the basis that the thought process in the native tongue has been set up and children will be able to absorb a new language. Would the Minister not agree that sufficient teachers in the system have a second European language and that with a little imagination, flair and flexibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's sense of urgency about the matter and I <Col N="1567" /> will try to move on it as quickly as I can. I have formally proposed in the introduction to the Green Paper the introduction of continental languages in primary schools. I strongly believe in that concept. I am aware however that there are other views on this matter. For example, same educators believe that learning Irish and English is already a burden on young children and it would be unfair to add another language to the list. I do not share that view. I believe that some exposure to continental languages at primary level is urgently required. Once this debate is concluded I plan to introduce the necessary regulations to ensure that this is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister when the teaching of European languages will be introduced in primary schools? Is he satisfied that the length of the school day can accommodate those classes? According to information available to me, students are already overloaded, so to speak, in the number of subjects they are taught. Does the Minister envisage extending the length of the school day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the practicalities will have to be worked out. If pupils are exposed to a continental language obviously we will have to look at the time devoted to the teaching of other subjects. As I said, I will have to work out the practicalities and how the time should be shared. My children attend primary school &mdash; I have met other children in the system also &mdash; and I would not be in favour of extending the length of the school day. The Deputy asked when I thought the teaching of continental languages would be introduced in primary schools. I should point out to the Deputy that many schools already have this system in place. I hope that a solid start can be made on the introduction of continental languages in schools next year when the legislation is in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor <Col N="1568" /> repeatedly made the point in this House that she would not agree to the introduction of a modern continental language in primary schools because it was not recommended by the Educational Review Body. As a prerequisite of having the language introduced in primary schools surely it should be a compulsory part of the syllabus in teacher training colleges. Would the Minister give a commitment that it will be placed on the syllabus of these colleges? There must be an organised start to the process and that is the only way of doing so. The Minister's predecessor was defensive because of the decision of the review body, but a review body should not be sacrosanct in these circumstances. The Minister should have the final say and should dictate the trend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the findings of the review body in that regard. Taking account of the debate that will take place over the next few months, I will proceed with the introduction of continental languages to primary schools. Obviously the curriculum for teacher training will have to be amended to take account of that. It may not be necessary to ensure that all teachers are trained in these languages. We may be able to deal with the matter on a specialisation basis, but I have not examined that yet. There are practicalities to making the policy decision of introducing continental languages to primary schools, such as that raised by Deputy Sheehan about the times and that raised by Deputy Deasy about how teachers are trained. I have yet to work out those practicalities, including whether or not we need to train all teachers or just some of them; but additional teacher training will be required in continental languages.</P>

      <P>There is one practicality which, I am sure, the Minister has considered. <Col N="1569" /> All of us in this House welcome the suggestion that continental languages will become part of the syllabus at primary level, but one practical problem is that many children are leaving primary school without an adequate competence in English, mathematics and so on. Many children leave primary schools functionally illiterate. How does the Minister propose to reallocate the already inadequate time and resources to deal with these children, or how does he propose to provide additional resources to primary schools to enable a continental language to be taught in these schools?</P>

      <P>There are too many people leaving the system, not just at primary level but at every level, who have not reached the required standard in literacy, numeracy and basic skills, and that is a concern.

The Deputy is quite right in raising a practical point. There are pupils in the system who have their hands full learning the subjects already available without having to learn more. Special arrangements will have to be made for those pupils, as we already make special arrangements for those who have trouble with the existing syllabus.</P>

      <Quest>if he is satisfied that adequate back-up will be made available to national school teachers if official assessment of pupils is introduced in view of the fact that such teachers have, over the years, assessed pupils in their classes and have not had any extra assistance in helping the known weaker children.</Quest>

      <P>It is part of the role of teachers in national schools to monitor the ongoing progress of pupils and to endeavour to assist in the development of weaker children. As part of the proposals in the Green Paper it is suggested that standardised tests be made available so that class teachers can more readily and accurately identify the precise levels of attainments of individual pupils.</P>
      <P>It is not true to suggest that no extra assistance has been available to help the known weaker children. Apart from the available expertise of the immediate class teacher, the remedial teaching service provides back-up support for children experiencing learning difficulties. Under the new arrangements priorities for additional resources will be more readily identified and I am confident that they will be made available.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> May I ask the Minister what will be the advantage of having an official assessment? Almost every primary teacher in the country knows how far behind pupils are but the difficulty arises when there are <Col N="1571" /> too many of these pupils in a class. I am not saying that there are no remedial teachers in the country but I would ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that there is a sufficient number of remedial teachers. Perhaps this measure is another red herring to satisfy parents that there are certain standards in primary schools. I do not see the point in these assessments considering that one can find out from any teacher in any classroom what the standards are, and they will be mixed in every classroom. If there is no logical reason for the assessment its introduction will only cause problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course one can find out the position from any teacher in any classroom, but my proposal is to find it out not by folklore, by anecdotes or by rumour; I need to find it out more formally so that I can target resources in a formal way to where they are needed. More than 40 per cent or primary schools in the State have remedial teachers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is good at sums. There are 945 remedial teachers covering 1,400 primary schools. I agree that more of these teachers are needed but I am satisfied that they are doing what needs to be done as best they can. In regard to the assessments proposed in the introduction to the Green Paper, which will be spelled out in the Green Paper proper, I suggest assessments at age seven, 11 and 15. These are not exams and they are not a reintroduction of the primary certificate by the back door. They are purely diagnostic and are a form of educational screening. It is not sensible that children who start school at four years of age proceed until they are 15 without any formal assessment of how they are getting on. I feel strongly that my proposal in the Green Paper should be fully discussed and considered calmly for the sake of the children involved because at the end of the day they are the important people.</P>

It is simply a means of identifying the problem. If resources were not limited, the right thing to do would be to present every child and every school with the service. Resources are limited and I have to target the remedial teaching facility where it is most needed. Official assessments will help me to do that.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister ensure uniformity in this official national assessment without committing large resources? If the results of these tests are to have any relevance or meaning in the national context there must be uniformity in their application. There are many tests available to teachers nowadays. The diagnosis is not the problem. The problem is lack of resources to deal with the difficulties identified in these tests. Other tests are being widely applied and information is available in schools. Why is the Minister introducing these tests and how can he ensure uniformity without committing <Col N="1574" /> large resources which could be better employed elsewhere?</P>

      <P>There will always be a problem of resources in education. No Minister for Education will ever have the resources that he or she needs to do everything that would be wished. It is incumbent on any Minister for Education and any Government to target resources where they are most urgently needed. I do not believe it is good educational policy to allow a gap of 11 years between the ages of four and 15 without any formal assessment of how pupils are getting on. I will be very interested in the formal response from the spokesmen on education about this concept. If they are against it I should like to hear it said loudly and clearly. For my part I do not want 11 years to elapse without some form of formalised assessment, which is not an examination. It will involve teachers doing work they already do but in a formal rather than an informal way. I am prepared to stand over my view and I should dearly like to hear the views of the educational spokesmen from other parties on that aspect of my proposal.</P>

The teacher needs enormous skill, patience and concentration to get through the day and the school year. I share the Deputy's respect for the work teachers do in the classroom. It is a very difficult job, much more so than most people understand. I have been talking to the union in question and I have asked them to consider, for example, what contribution the union might make to support their own members were such a scheme to be introduced. Given that I have laid out six aims in the introduction and that the first aim is to help the disadvantaged pupil, I have asked them to consider whether it would be legitimate for me to use funding for purposes other than that at the start. These are issues I am teasing out with the union in question.</P>

A staff room, library-medical room will be provided in the existing building which will also be upgraded.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the sketch plan in March 1991 it was sent to the school authorities to enable them to apply for local authority planning permission. Some difficulties were experienced by the school authorities in securing final planning permission which was forwarded to my Department in March 1992.</P>
      <P>The way is now clear for the preparation of tender documents and these will be completed at the earliest possible date. The question of invitation of tenders for the project will then arise for consideration in the context of the available capital and ongoing commitments.</P>
      <P>The officer referred to who had arranged the meeting of 23 April 1992 was unable to attend because of a day long official engagement elsewhere. Rather than defer the Hewetson meeting at short notice, he decided that his immediate subordinate and another staff member who were fully <i>au fait</i> with the case should meet the delegation who expressed no dissatisfaction at his absence.</P>
      <P>There has been no unavoidable delay in this case on the part of my Department who indeed have actively supported the school authorities on the project.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. On 19 December 1989 the then Minister for Education informed Hewetson school authorities that the building of a classroom extension and the provision of other facilities had been approved. Full planning permission was granted by Kildare County Council in January last.</P>
      <P>There is dreadful overcrowding in this small school and the classroom extension is badly needed. I would like the Minister to confirm the date when work may commence? It will not mean very much if I go back and tell the people involved that tender documents will be completed at the earliest possible date.</P>

The Church of Ireland school is the poor relation. Will he agree that what he has offered us today in effect is, &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;? He simply said that tender documents will be prepared. We know exactly how long it takes to prepare such documents but he should tell us the date on which they will be examined and the date when tenders will be sought. The Minister should do that today.</P>

      <P>I could not make policy decisions on the basis of gestures. I regret that any ill-feeling was caused by the way the deputation were dealt with. I am sure my official would also wish me to extend his regrets for any misunderstandings. I have undertaken to re-examine the case to see whether I can furnish some dates and I hope to do so as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 18, 51, 53, 61, 91, 93 and 94 together. I am aware of the publication of <i>The Cost of Free Education</i> booklet by the National Parents Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will know the day-to-day running costs of primary schools are discharged by making funds available by means of the capitation grant scheme and the contribution from local sources. The capitation grant is not intended to meet the operating costs in full. A local contribution towards school running costs <Col N="1583" /> equivalent to 25 per cent of the capital grant must be lodged annually to each school bank account.</P>
    <P>On the matter of adequacy of the capitation grant generally, my Department are currently undertaking study of the recurrent costs of operating schools in the primary and post-primary sectors. I will be considering the existing rates of capitation grants in the light of the results of this study.</P>
    <P>In addition to the capitation grants scheme my Department provide further assistance to primary schools in disadvantaged areas. The amount provided in 1992 under the scheme for schools in such areas is £1.6 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the primary school sector is grossly underfunded when compared with our EC partners leaving us at a disadvantage? Would he agree that most staff in primary schools spend a great deal of time on fund-raising activities? I know of teachers who spend most of their free time fund-raising. Monday nights there are card drives, on Tuesday nights, bingo, on Wednesday nights a quiz, on Thursday nights a bazaar and perhaps a concert on Friday nights. Staff time is taken up with such fund raising activities because the Government are failing in their duty to provide adequate funding. Can the Minister inform the House of the last increase in the capitation grant and when does he expect to increase it further?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied at the level of capitation grants for primary schools, which is now £28 per pupil. Another 25 per cent, £7 per pupil, has to be provided locally. I would like to avail of this opportunity to publicly acknowledge, thank and salute the work of parents, voluntary groups, religious, parishes and everybody concerned with the non-State funding of our primary schools system. They make a substantially <Col N="1584" /> greater contribution than has been generally recognised. For example, I note in <i>The Cost of Free Education</i> booklet by the National Parents Council that in 20 per cent of Dublin schools parents contribute 50 per cent or more of the funds. We would like to be able to provide more funds but I am constrained because of lack of resources and I have to examine how I can approach that problem. In attempting to approach the problem we must first recognise its existence and we must recognise that without the great work of the non-State sector in primary and national school systems we would be in a very difficult situation. In my time as Minister for Education I will make every effort to see how I might improve the situation, but I do have resource hurdles to overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the local contribution made by parents is not just 25 per cent of the capitation grant but that the capitation grant is only about 25 per cent of the cost of running a school? Can he give some indication as to when the study to which he referred will be completed and specifically whether it will be completed on time for him to make a decision to increase the capitation grant in advance of the coming school year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair to give any guarantee for the coming school year. All I can do today is acknowledge that I understand the problem. For example, I am aware insurance premiums have risen. That is an enormous burden on many schools and energy costs and so on can fluctuate. The primary education review body report suggested that a sum of £80 <i>per capita</i> would be more in tune. I am saying this quite openly because I understand the difficulties and I know the figures are not adding up for many national schools. I am giving this matter my utmost attention but in doing so I do not want to raise expectations. My aim today is to acknowledge that all the evidence suggests that without the input from the non-State sector many primary schools would have great difficulty. I <Col N="1585" /> appreciate their contribution to the State and to the children in the system. I will continue to examine how I can help in that regard.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the constitutional requirement which states that the State shall provide free primary education and that the purpose of this requirement of the Constitution was to ensure equality of education. Would the Minister agree that the fact that Ministers are not adhering to the Constitution is creating enormous disparities between the type of schools, the standard of schools and the equipment of schools in well heeled areas as opposed to the severely deprived areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under a number of headings special provisions are being made for disadvantaged areas. For example, extra allotments of remedial teachers and extra allotments of teachers generally and a number of schemes are specially targeted at the disadvantaged. Lest I give the wrong impression I should point out clearly that the State currently pays some £450 million for the salaries of those in the primary school system. While I accept the criticism about the free aspect of the primary school system, I should say it is substantially free.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the present situation, where niggardly provision is made for a small number of disadvantaged schools, the Department are institutionalising those caught in the poverty trap? Where there are means available to parents in the catchment area of a school extra curricula activities can be provided, so that we cannot talk about increasing the grant in isolation. A large number of people on the poverty line come from areas of educational disadvantage. Many of these areas are not in the disadvantaged areas scheme so that in terms of social equity <Col N="1586" /> the Government are failing these children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that approach. My task is to raise the contribution to less well off schools, not necessarily to lower the contribution to other schools who can provide greater local contributions. We have to increase the contribution to the less well off schools. We do this by means of the various schemes to which I have already referred and by examining the capitation grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Mac Giolla has pointed out, Bunreacht na hÉireann states quite specifically that the State shall provide for free primary education. As the Minister acknowledges, it is a myth. Surely there is a need to target specific resources to do away with the glaring anomalies and disparities that have arisen for poor areas. If you are in a poor school you cannot have speech and drama, music, modern languages, swimming and you cannot go on a school tour because you cannot afford it. Surely there is a need for specific resources in areas identified as needing urgent targeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we are doing a substantial amount of that by targeting the disadvantaged schemes to the disadvantaged areas. The country has been bedevilled with constitutional debate and constitutional argument for some time and I do not intend to dwell on it too deeply. The constitutional requirement of the State is to provide education.</P>

      <P>Yes. Whether drama, music, swimming and those type of activities are included in that definition would keep constitutional lawyers busy for many a long day. As I said earlier, my <Col N="1587" /> own particular philosophy is not necessarily to keep down the areas that can provide these extra curricular activities but to try to target and streamline resources into the areas that cannot afford them. We are doing that by means of the various schemes of which the Deputy is aware.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 12 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The 1992 capital allocation for primary school building is £14 million and £17.225 million for secondary building. These building programmes are ongoing and entirely directed towards the provision of urgent accommodation requirements. It is my intention to continue this policy.</P>
      <P>The sums allocated to date in the context of the 1992 capital provisions have been utilised in full in meeting expenditure arising from major projects already in progress, provision of urgent prefabricated accommodation, emergency works, resource and equipment grants, site and property acquisitions and fees for design work. The capital allocations will be fully utilised in meeting expenditure arising under these categories during the year.</P>
      <P>My predecessor approved a placing of contracts in 1992 for a number of primary and secondary projects with the intention that the actual starting date this year would depend on ongoing expenditure within the overall capital allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that his predecessor allocated the entire budget before leaving office and that that leaves him in an invidious position? It leaves a number of secondary and primary schools throughout the <Col N="1589" /> country in a difficult position in that they cannot proceed although an indication was given to them by the Minister's predecessor's predecessor that they could proceed in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The system does not work that way. There are ongoing contractual commitments. There are needs for new prefabricated accommodation. There is rationalisation work going on. There is new work commencing. There are fees to be paid and all this eats up the annual allocation. It is not true to say that the entire allocation was dealt with in one particular decision.</P>
      <P>I should tell the House that I am preparing a new mechanism for the decision-making process in regard to the provision of school accommodation for consideration by the Government in the next couple of weeks. I still stand over all of the legal commitments entered into by my predecessors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no further funds at my disposal for 1992 for any major works other than emergency works and ongoing matters which are carried over from last year. Indeed, we are already beginning to commit some part of the 1993 budget, which is a routine procedure, whereby we are permitted to commit small amounts of that budget. There are never enough funds in the capital allocation to meet all the requirements. I plan to put in place a new mechanism for deciding priorities so that these decisions are taken totally and utterly on the basis of economic, educational and social grounds. There will be a form of priority listing which I will have more to say about in the weeks ahead.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy in referring to a recent report has in mind that prepared by the education committee of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and which received publicity in the media recently. I understand that the report was prepared as a paper to facilitate discussion within the teaching profession. The paper raises questions and issues for discussion rather than makes recommendations. These issues will be considered as they arise in the context of the Green Paper discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to time to be allocated for religious education in second level schools at present is as follows. (1) Secondary: The Department do not lay down any period to be devoted to religious instruction. A maximum of three hours of religious education is reckonable in the obligatory minimum 18 hours instruction period required of each teacher per week in order to qualify for <Col N="1591" /> payment of incremental salary; (2) Comprehensive schools: Religious education must be provided but no time period per week is specified by the Department; (3) Community and vocational schools: Official documentation issued to such schools has envisaged a period of the order of two hours per week for religious education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to amend the rules for national schools in terms of the existing requirement whereby religious instruction is integrated into secular instruction? Has the Minister sought the advice of the Attorney General with regard to the constitutionality of the integration of religious and secular teaching, and what was the nature of his advice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>The Attorney General has suggested to me that I should await seeking his advice on constitutional aspects of this matter until the High Court has indicated its views. At that time I will, of course, seek his views on the constitutional issues. Up to now I have only sought his views on the general legal situation and that is his advice in that regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to national schools, the Deputy is probably aware that the rules for national schools are that no pupil shall receive or be present at religious instruction of which his parents or guardians disapprove, and that there is a procedure to facilitate the withdrawal of pupils who do not wish to receive this instruction.</P>

I was referring to the rules for national schools which require that a religious ethos must be part of the general instruction in the school.

      <P>Before we adjourned I was highlighting the need to recruit personnel into the Navy to meet the challenges of the future. Their conditions of service should be improved to increase awareness that they will have a major role to play in protecting our rich fishing grounds and our coastline against criminal elements who will see the dismantling of our custom posts as providing them with an opportunity to exploit the population, especially our young people, by illegally importing drugs and arms.</P>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our Air Corps, in particular the air sea rescue unit, which has given sterling service during the years in saving life, very often under extreme conditions. Even though they are now part of a new rescue service their achievements should be recorded and the service that they have given must be recognised. They were exceptionally effective for many years.</P>
      <P>I would also like to mention An Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil, Slua Muirí and the Civil Defence, which are made up of many dedicated and highly motivated people who are serving the country on a voluntary basis. To their credit they provide a very efficient service despite the financial cutbacks of recent years. They have responded in a very practical way in relation to their patriotism.</P>
      <P>I note from the Estimate that the allocation for Civil Defence has been cut back substantially. This should be deplored because they have provided a great service for both the community and the various civic services when needed. They have been called out to fight fires and asked to be involved in crowd control. They have responded in a positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to the position in which army pensioners find themselves. Many of these have given a life's service to the Army and the Navy and have served with distinction in the Congo, Cyprus and the Lebanon. Many of them had no option but to seek jobs to augment their pensions <Col N="1637" /> once they left the Army. I sincerely believe that a realistic pension structure should now be put in place so that the service of these veterans, many of whom have families to support, is recognised by the State. The Minister should do this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to examine the position of single men who retire from the Army. Very often these men have no family home to go to as their families have either married, died or scattered. These men, who have given a life's service to the country, should not be neglected in any way.</P>
    <P>Recent press statements from the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen should be the source of serious concern for both the Minister and the Government. It appears that there are ex-servicemen living rough in our cities and towns for the reasons I have already outlined. While I recognise that pre-discharge courses are being provided, it is obvious that the problem of homelessness among ex-servicemen must be examined and resolved. It is incumbent upon the Government to make sure that each person who retires from the Army has somewhere to live and to call his own.</P>
    <P>Even though this is a small nation with a population of just over 3.5 million people and that our resources are not great, for far too long the Defence Forces have been the poor relation. We have been served by a loyal, dedicated group of men and women, who have received the Nobel Peace Prize along with UNIFIL. This was a rare and special achievement and we were very proud when it was awarded. We have received this excellent service on the cheap. I ask the Minister to convince his Cabinet colleagues that the Defence Forces should receive priority and that the standard in all branches of the Defence Forces should be brought up to an acceptable level to meet the challenges of the nineties and of the next millennium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the area mentioned by a number of speakers, that is the Civil Defence, for <Col N="1638" /> which I have responsibility. This year's provision of £1.78 million for the Civil Defence represents an increase on the 1991 allocation of £1.68 million. The allocation will facilitate the continuing ability and effectiveness of the Civil Defence services to cope with any emergency situation involving its various roles. Despite recent encouraging developments in the international scene, regional conflicts continue to occur and the threat of a peacetime nuclear incident is ever present. The multi-faceted skills of the Civil Defence services and the vehicles and equipment they utilise also provide a valuable resource in dealing with emergency situations in the local community. In effect, Civil Defence is a valuable form of necessary insurance at very low annual cost for each member of the population.</P>
      <P>The recruitment and training of volunteers in rescue, casualty, auxiliary fire service, welfare and warden skills and the development of the organisation is the responsibility of local authorities. The main costs involve salaries to full time and part time Civil Defence officers and to assistant Civil Defence officers, fees to instructors, administration, including telephones, heating and lighting, local and central training, running and maintenance of vehicles, storage of equipment, maintenance of control centres and local exercises, field days, parades and community assistance. The total gross cost incurred by local authorities in this regard is of the order of £2 million of which my Department bears 70 per cent, or some £1.4 million. In addition, capital grants at the rate of 70 per cent are available to finance the network of county control centres. This year such grants will be of the order of £1.1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Defence school continues to play a central role in the training of volunteers and instructors and this year will initiate a new programme of training in rescue techniques suitable for different basic situations, such as rescue from heights. Other areas are to be examined at local level in association with my Department which may lead to further new training at the school where a programme <Col N="1639" /> of courses in established disciplines is continuing throughout 1992. Local training courses with the aid of school instructors are also contributing to the development of Civil Defence skills.</P>
    <P>A total of £230,000 will also be committed this year for the purchase by my Department of Civil Defence equipment and clothing. This programme will include uniforms and protective clothing, which are in constant demand. A working jumper will be purchased for the first time and an increased volume of updated equipment will also be obtained to facilitate training in new rescue techniques for varying hazards. An ambulance will be acquired to assess the type of ambulance which will be required for the future use of Civil Defence. A further £50,000 will also be spent on national exercises which will help to maintain the standards and commitment of the volunteers.</P>
    <P>Until recently the main thrust of Civil Defence has been to procure for our population as adequate a response as possible to the threats that would be engendered by an outbreak of nuclear war. Over the last number of years, however, there has been a gradual change in the role of the organisation. While Civil Defence maintains its capability to respond to a wartime situation, its peacetime activities are continuously being developed and improved.</P>
    <P>The same skills and expertise are called into play in both peacetime and wartime. The civil defence organisation support, where appropriate, the regular emergency services. The range of civil defence support includes first-aid and ambulance services, rescue work, helping to repair damage caused by floods, assisting in the provision of emergency feeding and shelter, crisis counselling, crowd and traffic control, evacuation and search parties.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for Civil Defence, I have sought, and will continue to seek, ways to improve the organisation. A working party with countrywide representation has been established <Col N="1640" /> to help to develop a policy initiative to increase the effectiveness of civil defence and to consider its roles and functions for the future. I invite the Opposition spokespersons to meet me in the near future to discuss the role of civil defence in the context of this overall development.</P>
    <P>All the major emergency plans framed by local authorities under the direction of the Department of the Environment provide for the involvement of civil defence in the implementation of these plans. This requires the organisation to prepare and train to fulfil their role in assisting at major emergencies and accidents and much has been learnt through international contacts in this area.</P>
    <P>Civil defence has specific roles in relation to the Department of Energy emergency plan and radiological emergencies, for which the members are being specially trained and equipped. Those roles relate primarily to radiation monitoring, sampling soil, water and vegetation and in the implementation of decontamination measures. At this point I should mention that it is intended to stage a radiological exercise later this year in which, I am pleased to say all civil defence personnel will participate.</P>
    <P>It is also hoped to hold group exercises this year in the four administrative group areas. These exercises will involve multiservice teams being deployed from their home base to the exercise area after being alerted from the control centre at the exercise site. This will necessitate extensive use of radio communications.</P>
    <P>While we can be satisfied with our Civil Defence structures and can point to a reasonable holding of operational and training equipment, hardware and accommodation throughout the country at large, it is necessary to constantly update planning, the revision of training techniques and the assimilation of new technology. As regards planning, the important development has been the redirection of the organisation towards preparedness for peacetime accidents and emergencies as well as nuclear accidents, while not ignoring the possibility of regional conflicts. International contacts <Col N="1641" /> have been availed of to make available to our planners and instructors the benefit of the lessons learned from such disasters as the Armenian earthquake, the Zeebrugge disaster, the incidents at Heysel and Hillsborough football stadia, etc. This in turn has led to a complete reassessment of the organisation's attitude to welfare requirements in the aftermath of disasters which has led to the launching of a completely revised welfare instructional manual for the guidance of our welfare instructors. Also, one of our school instructors visited the province of Bakhtaran, Iran, in the aftermath of the Gulf War to study at first hand the handling of the Kurdish refugees. The experience obtained on this trip and overseas contacts will determine what contribution Civil Defence can offer to international disasters.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to thank the Irish Red Cross Society and the Department of Foreign Affairs for their help in the organisation of this training exercise for our instructor. The organisation is approaching a reasonable level of self sufficiency in the area of radio communication and has in place a nationwide facsimile system. Parallel with this, computer development is underway which will greatly enhance operational capability and improve the administrative structures. The headquarters development in this respect at Ratra House in Dublin is complete and the design and implementation of the local authority systems is underway.</P>
    <P>During 1991 the remainder of the regional civil defence officers, who were Army commandants seconded to the organisation, returned to their military duties. I compliment and thank them, and previous regional and civil defence officers, for their dedication to the development of Civil Defence throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to pay special tribute to the civil defence school staff who have continued professionally to meet the challenges presented by the changing scenario, to the county controllers and civil defence officers without whose dedication and involvement there <Col N="1642" /> could be no success at local level and, most importantly, to the volunteers who have shown themselves true patriots in serving their communities with the expectation of no more reward than a simple &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the Estimate for the Department of Defence is being taken in the same week in which the first annual conference of PDFORRA is taking place in Galway. The establishment of this organisation must be recognised as one of the most significant developments in the history of the Defence Forces. I congratulate all the active members and the wives of Army personnel who agitated for the establishment of a representative body and were successful. This organisation gives them a platform from which to air their many grievances. I wish them every success in future in their negotiations with the Department.</P>
      <P>Those who fought for the right to establish a representative organisation risked their careers. They and the Army Spouses' Association showed great courage, and the latter organisation took the matter to the hustings during the 1989 General Election. Notwithstanding the threats and dire warnings from the arm-chair generals, the fact that soldiers and sailors have their own representative association has not created any threat to order or discipline within the Defence Forces. Indeed, it has contributed to the strengthening of the Defence Forces and has given a much needed boost to morale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few people believed that the establishment of the representative association would automatically lead to a solution of all the problems faced by the Defence Forces personnel. The establishment of PDFORRA and RACO was not the end of the struggle, but it was a major victory and I congratulate the Minister at that time who afforded them recognition. He was sympathetic to their case and had to overcome many objections from the military personnel. This is only the beginning for these organisations, but they have provided a legitimate platform for <Col N="1643" /> personnel to highlight grievances in regard to wages and working conditions.</P>
    <P>One only has to read the accounts yesterday and today of the issues raised at the PDFORRA conference to appreciate how much still has to be done. While the implementation of the Gleeson report has improved the basic income of most soldiers, their pay is much lower than their counterparts in civilian life, particularly the Garda Síochána. The gap is probably greatest in facilities and allowances.</P>
    <P>While I would agree with the Minister's statement that the majority of the members of the Defence Forces have duties quite dissimilar to those of the Garda, the danger and discomfort experienced when standing on a wet Border road in the middle of winter doing check-point duty, for example, is every bit as discomforting for soldiers as it is for gardaí. I argue that there is absolutely no justification for allowing the anomaly to continue in which a garda may get up to seven times more money in allowances than a soldier. I firmly believe that the Government must set about taking steps to introduce a proper system of allowances similar to that operating for the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many people would have been shocked to read the graphic accounts of substandard accommodation in which soldiers have to live and work described by the PDFORRA conference this week. Claims were made that 70 per cent of military accommodation is substandard; that soldiers' families living in the Curragh barracks have to do without indoor toilets, in this day and age; that soldiers who are living in have to share two or three toilets or showers between as many as 60 men. The Minister must agree that those are conditions more appropriate to the Second World War than to the end of the 20th century. It is clear that the Government must act on the motion passed by the PDFORRA conference calling for &ldquo;a building programme to bring accommodation for soldiers up to a level fit for human habitation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> I well remember the Dickensian conditions that existed in Cathal Brugha barracks, a barracks in my own constituency. Clothes had to be dried on open air lines and soldiers' wives had to do their washing in troughs in communal washing facilities. Those were the conditions that applied to married soldiers and their families. Thankfully, those barracks have been demolished and replaced.</P>
    <P>In more recent times, however, when on a visit to Collins barracks I witnessed primitive dormitory conditions that are not and can never be acceptable under any circumstances when soldiers have to stay overnight. The rooms were riddled with dry rot and the sparcity of tables, lockers and other furniture was shocking. It is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Having experienced the attempt to clear up the mess at the Cathal Brugha barracks in Rathmines by demolishing substandard accommodation, I thought that the Government were headed down the right direction. However, as the conference in Galway has demonstrated, there is a huge range of inferior accommodation in barracks throughout the country. I ask the Minister to remedy that problem as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Another problem that requires examination is the alarming increase in the age profile of army personnel. Between 1981 and 1991 the average age of a sergeant increased from 34 to 40, the average age of a corporal increased from 30 to 34 and the average age of a private increased from 24 to 30. Most military experts believe that the ideal age for a private falls within the early twenties, so the current age profile of our Army personnel clearly has implications for the operational efficiency and fitness of the Army.</P>
    <P>The increase in the average age is due to two factors: the ban on recruitment in the past few years and the fact that fewer soldiers are leaving the service, clearly because of the shortage of jobs available in civilian life. The only way to remedy the problem is to bring in new blood. The establishment level of the Defence Forces is more than 18,000, but the actual level is only about 13,000. There is considerable scope for additional recruitment. <Col N="1645" /> I am sure that the Minister is aware of the huge number of people who would give their right arm to get a job. With 300,000 people unemployed, the stark truth is that the Defence Forces are understaffed and the doors of recruitment should be opened in order to give a military career to people who would otherwise be condemned to a life on the dole. This is really a problem that can only worsen if ignored. Substantial recruitment is the only way to tackle it.</P>
    <P>More than 800 of our Defence Force personnel now serve with 11 different United Nations forces throughout the world, in extremely difficult and often hazardous trouble spots. As a nation, we are all justifiably proud of the job those personnel are doing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Army are a very up to date and efficient Army. The Army provides a great way of life for the young man or woman and it is a great pity that we do not have the resources to recruit many More young people. I feel that there should be compulsory Army training for every young person to last at least six months. Such training would stand our <Col N="1646" /> youth in good stead for the rest of their lives and would make them much more independent.</P>
    <P>I made representations to the former Minister for Defence asking that he remove the means test from special allowance holders. Only 650 people receive the special allowance and there are fewer than 300 in receipt of the military service pension. I felt it was a shame that the pension of some special allowance recipients was reduced and it was for that reason that I made representations to both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance to have the income level of eligibility for qualification for that allowance increased. I am glad to hear that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increases are being applied to Army pensioners and to the veterans of the War of Independence. The means test for special allowances has been eased, a measure that I welcome very much. I appeal to the Minister for Defence to increase those pensions by 100 per cent next year. It is my opinion that that could be done for £1,500,000. There are very few veterans of the War of Independence remaining and we owe them a great debt of gratitude for the effort they put in to secure the independence we enjoy today. The very least we might give them is a substantial pension that is not means tested.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Estimate for Defence now stands at £51 billion, which represents an increase of £1.6 billion.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the plight of a very small group of widows of deceased soldiers who had long service in the Army. The widows of those soldiers now find that because their late husbands did not for one reason or another join the defence force contributory pension scheme at the time it was introduced they do not qualify for a widow's pension. Most of those widows were not aware of that position until their husbands died. The number of women involved is very small and I appeal to the Minister to make some provision for them on compassionate grounds.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the <Col N="1647" /> Army barracks in Tralee town, County Kerry. The buildings and the grounds of the barracks are in an excellent state of repair. There is a small section of the regular Army stationed there, and the FCA train there in the summer. Will the Minister consider having a permanent unit of the Army stationed in Tralee Army Barracks where there are excellent facilities?</P>
    <P>I am delighted that 9,000 members of the FCA now form a valuable unit of the Army. In my own county they are very active and are essential. I am glad the Minister and the Army think so highly of them. I wish them the best of luck for the future.</P>
    <P>When concluding the debate will the Minister address the matter of AIDS which was raised at the PDFORRA conference. This is a very real danger facing our soldiers when they go abroad.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to wish the Minister and the Army the best of luck for the future. I wish to share my time with Deputy Clohessy.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to echo the views expressed by the Tánaiste concerning the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. The provisions dealing with a common foreign and security policy should be welcomed as a positive development. The Treaty strengthens the ability of EC countries to work together on international issues and provides a means for taking joint political and diplomatic action. As such, the strength of the Community as a force for peace and stability in the world will be enhanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, defence issues are specifically excluded from the area of joint action and the Treaty does not set up a common defence policy. It contains no mutual defence commitments of any kind and, of course, conscription is a red herring <Col N="1648" /> introduced by opponents of the Treaty for their own ends.</P>
    <P>It is particularly appropriate that this debate on the Defence Estimates should take place in the same week as the inaugural conference of PDFORRA, one of the recently established representative bodies for members of the armed forces.</P>
    <P>In the past three years a great deal of attention has been focused on the need for reform and change in the Defence Forces. Much of this attention has focused on the need to improve conditions of serving personnel and while the implementation of the recommendations of the Gleeson report in 1990 resulted in the payment of increases in pay and allowances it is quite clear that problems still remain in this area. I am particularly concerned, for example, at continuing complaints which are made about the standard or sub-standard conditions of so many military homes and of stories of long-serving personnel still dependent on the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>The ability of the new representative bodies to air these grievances publicly must be welcomed and must add considerably to the debate. I hope we might begin to make progress now on responding to these problems and improving the position of all members of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Given that we are debating an Estimate of over £320 million pounds, it is regrettable that such problems should still exist. The Defence Forces, like every public service organisation, must continually adapt to meet current requirements in the most efficient manner. Arising from the publication of the Gleeson report, considerable attention has been given to the process of reorganising and restructuring the Defence Forces. The Government will ensure that the momentum for change is maintained.</P>
    <P>Irish people rightly take pride in the exemplary contribution made by our military personnel to the cause of peace through participation in peacekeeping missions. While our principal contribution is to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, Irish personnel are at present serving in no fewer than 16 <Col N="1649" /> countries. In 1991 the European Community took an important first step in the area of peacekeeping through the formation of the EC monitoring group in Yugoslavia. Ireland's participation in an international peacekeeping mission with our partners in the Community is an historic initiative.</P>
    <P>Ireland, through the medium of participation in international peacekeeping, has the capacity to make a positive and real contribution to the process of building peace and security in many troubled parts of the world. Our soldiers deserve our fullest praise for the courage, professionalism and dedication to duty which they have shown through decades of service with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The practice of participating to the fullest extent in international peacekeeping missions, subject only to the demands imposed by security at home, is widely supported on both sides of this House and among all sections of the general public.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Tánaiste has endorsed the recommendation that women should be granted the long overdue equal opportunity in the forces. Women have been serving in the forces since 1980. It is important to ensure that the process of expanding their role will be continued and that a wide range of career alternatives for women are provided. Last year for the first time women were enlisted as apprentices. 1991 also saw the first recruitment of women to the FCA. The acceptance by the Tánaiste of the report will be widely welcomed. I would express the hope that the recommendations will be implemented as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>In the scandalously short time made available for this debate it is possible only to touch briefly on some of the issues that arise. The provision in this year's Estimate for accommodation can only be tiny. The Minister outlined this morning the main areas in which capital <Col N="1650" /> expenditure will take place this year. The expenditure will take place on the much needed operational and dining facilities and not in the area of accommodation. Living next door, as I do, to the Curragh where there is the largest military establishment in the country, I can say that the Defence Forces, the Army and the Department of Defence have only begun to scratch the surface of the accommodation problem. It is not an exaggeration to say that serving soldiers and some of their families are living in slums and we are not making enough progress to deal with that problem. There are some areas where the Defence Forces in the past provided reasonably modern housing. We need a lot more. We need a major building programme to provide accommodation for single members of the force and for married members with their families.</P>
      <P>We also need much closer co-operation between the Defence Forces authorities and the housing authorities throughout the country to help members of the Defence Forces who are married and who have families to get out of this horrible trap in which they frequently find themselves when they come to the end of their service &mdash; of carrying on as over holders in Defence Forces accommodation, having their pensions withheld from them and in some cases from their serviving spouses and families. I endorse everything that PDFORRA said on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of pay and allowances, the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence this morning displayed a most incredible smugness. I will not go further than to say that I do not believe in fixing immutable relativities between grades, professions and jobs in the way that has been the bane of industrial relations here in the past, but there is no doubt that any fair minded person comparing the rates of pay of our Defence Forces, the Prison Service and the Garda Síochána will find that the Defence Forces are way behind the other two services, for a job which is much more demanding on them individually, which requires of them a greater effort than might be expected of other groups and which involves unsocial working <Col N="1651" /> hours and inadequate living conditions.</P>
    <P>I have great admiration and respect for the professionalism of those serving in our Defence Forces, whether commissioned or non-commissioned. Nothing I am about to say now should in any way take from that nor is it intended to do so. This should be an opportunity for us to debate the role and function of our Defence Forces. The Minister did not even try to do that this morning. He capped it all, and showed his total disinterest in the subject, by being unable to defer his lunch sufficiently long even to hear the Opposition spokesperson talk about this Estimate.</P>
    <P>The role of our Defence Forces, as classically perceived to date, as far as I know, is to defend our territory, to make it so inconvenient for an invader that an invader would conclude it was not worth the effort the policy being not necessarily to keep invaders out but, once they arrived to be in a position to harry and harass them so much, to inflict so much loss on them, they would conclude that the game was not worth the candle, so that the invaders either would not come in the first place or, having come, would take themselves off again. I wonder has thinking on that evolved at all; in the thinking relevant to the world in which we live today? I submit that it is not. It is for this reason I submit we need to undertake a reassessment of the role of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>As I have said, our Defence Forces are staffed by extremely professional people. I know many of them very well at all levels, but they do not have the tools to do that job. If one could conceive of an invasion of this island of ours with the use of conventional forces only &mdash; I will leave out the whole nuclear scenario because obviously we are not equipped to deal with that at all; that is another day's work &mdash; no likely invader anywhere visible on the horizon or just over it &mdash; if we had the radar to see them which we do not &mdash; would do it without a substantial input of air power. All the lessons of modern warfare show the importance, <Col N="1652" /> both for the air forces and land forces, of superiority in the air. Therefore, we would first be subjected to an airborne assault. We could not stop it. We have anti-aircraft batteries, most of which to my knowledge, are manned by people who have never fired a live shell; certainly they have never fired one in anger but they have never even fired one for practice because it is too expensive, and we have only a few of them. But, apart from that, we have no other way of dealing with an airborne attack on this island. Our Air Corps &mdash; and again I salute their professionalism &mdash; are not equipped to do so either. We train people to pilot jets on very outdated jet aircraft. They do not even have anything like the technology to be found in a modern airliner, the fly-by-wire technology so much the rage these days. We do not have adequate resources to train them for any kind of offensive operation from an aircraft except, as I understand it, very limited counter insurgency operations. I am not sure whether they have ever been trained in that role but that is all we can train them in. That is not what is needed against modern attack aircraft.</P>
    <P>It is very much a probability that, in the event of an attack on this island, our land forces would be decimated very quickly and would not be in a position then to carry out the other role they are supposed to have, which is to operate as a mobile harrying force, harrying the enemy with the backing of a supportive population. They cannot do that; we are not training them to do that; we have not equipped them to do so. If we were to equip them to do so, what would we need? We would need a major investment in anti-aircraft facilities, both fixed and mobile, now vulnerable to smart bombs. We would need a major investment in transport vehicles, in logistics vehicles, in armoured personnel carriers and in anti-armour weaponry. That would be a major investment, not to speak of what we would need in order to counter any possible threat of bombardment from off our coasts. We are not equipped to do that. I honestly cannot see that any Government over the next ten <Col N="1653" /> years in this country would be able to spend money at the level required to withstand such an attack.</P>
    <P>That begs the question: what do we need? I submit we need the following: we need an improved search and rescue service. We now have one in place which would not have been in place without the energy and dedication of my party, in particular, our spokesperson on Defence, Deputy Taylor-Quinn. It has been strengthened but is not anything like sufficient; we should be providing much more. We need to improve the fishery patrol service and the Border patrol for as long as that problem obtains. Then we need some kind of armed force to help support and expand the service being provided by the Garda Síochána in our prisons and provide the cash escorts that public policy &mdash; and public policy only mind you &mdash; dictates that we require here. It seems to me that as our Defence Forces cannot fulfil the classical, primary role given them, that as we need a much greater input into these other roles I have listed &mdash; and I would not claim that my list is exhaustive &mdash; and that as we need a much greater capacity in those roles, a fundamental&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and wish the new Minister for Defence &mdash; we have had a few incumbents over the past few years &mdash; well in his task, and indeed the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, who is also present.</P>
      <P>We have seen major changes within our Defence Forces in recent years which we would all agree were badly needed. There was much discussion following the publication of the Gleeson Report on their remuneration and conditions of service. The creation of the Defence Forces representatives bodies was another welcome development. If Members recall the period preceding the establishment of these bodies they will readily recall that there was a very serious morale problem, when members of the Defence Forces felt they were not being treated properly, were being taken for granted. Indeed they had good reason to so believe. It was against that background that Gleeson was asked to report on their remuneration and conditions of service. I am indeed happy that most of these recommendations of the Gleeson Report have been implemented, resulting in morale having improved enormously. However, we must not take that to mean that everything is in order, since there remain a number of major problems to be tackled. A number of Members have outlined many of them. While we cannot ignore the improvements wrought in recent years it would be foolish of us not to realise the many serious problems remaining to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind first the improvement of barracks and living conditions generally. Deputy Dukes referred to this matter. Both of us, representing the same constitutency, will be familiar with conditions prevailing at the Curragh Camp, where there are some disused barracks and more badly in need of renovation. Even more worrying are the staff living conditions about which descriptive words were used at this week's conference, such as that they were unfit for <Col N="1655" /> human habitation, were deplorable and so on. Having seen some of these I would have to agree with much of what has been said about them. If we are to endeavour to show the members of the Defence Forces that we take them and their role seriously it is imperative that we address those problems in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The issue of Border duty has raised its head again this week, something we cannot ignore. While not wishing in any way to compare the role of the members of the Defence Forces and that of the Garda Síochána, nonetheless we would need to be realistic and ensure that they are properly rewarded and accommodated. The present position is unacceptable. I should like to see major changes implemented in that area.</P>
    <P>Much reference has been made over the past few weeks to the issue of defence in the context of the Treaty on European Union. Ireland has a tradition of staying outside military alliances and this position is recognised by a specific provision in the Treaty which states that a policy of the European Union in the security area shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states. The Treaty does not contain a common defence policy. People who mention conscription &mdash; we have heard much about this over the past few weeks &mdash; are talking rubbish. It is about time the record was put straight in this respect.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Reserve Defence Force. I am sorry that expenditure on this force is again being curtailed. I have great admiration for members of the FCA. It is vital that the Defence Forces should have a highly trained reserve. I urge the Minister to restore the two week full-time training course for members of the FCA. The effective strength of the first line reserve is less than 900. These members are not being called up for fulltime training. I was heartened to hear that a representative association for the Reserve Defence Force is to be established.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to pay tribute to members of the Defence Forces and to <Col N="1656" /> wish them well in the future. I hope Members now understand their plight a little better.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús comhghairdeas a ghabháil don Aire úr agus go mór mhór don Aire Stáit atá anseo, ina gcuid phostanna nua. I hope that many changes will be introduced in the Defence Forces. As a Deputy from a Border constituency I am acutely aware of the differences between the levels of pay and allowances given to members of the Defence Forces and members of the Garda Síochána. I hope the Minister will rectify this anomaly so as to ensure the Defence Forces and the Garda receive the same amount of work as members of the Garda Síochána, should not be the same.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Defence Forces has not increased appreciably over the past number of years. The trend by members to stay in the Army for much longer than before will lead to an age structure which may be much older than that desired by many people. I realise that many members are tied up in administration work. A debate has taken place on the possibility of transferring some of the functions of the Garda to civilians. The introduction of such a system in the Army would enable many members engaged in administrative work to be transferred to operational duties. I ask the Minister to consider recruiting members to the Army, perhaps on a phased basis, over the next few years. This would ensure that the age structure of the Army would not change dramatically. While those with long service are needed for good ideas in the Defence Forces, young blood is also needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted at the progress being made in the recruitment of women to the Defence Forces. I hope women will be recruited to the FCA also. The FCA have made a tremendous contribution to the Defence Forces. Like my colleague, I ask the Minister to increase the number of training days for members of the FCA. <Col N="1657" /> The decrease from 14 to seven days in the length of the training course should be considered in the context of the tremendous work carried out by senior members of the FCA.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to air and sea rescue services. Tremendous progress has been made in the provision of facilities for air and sea rescue. There was a great need for such facilities in the north west and I commend those involved in the air and sea rescue services there. I hope there will be more investment in these services so that we will not have to use the services of other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish PDFORRA every success in the future. This association had been waiting a long time to be recognised, and I was proud to be present at the conference at which that was announced. Some of the issues raised at that conference were of interest to me, particularly the proposed closure of Army barracks. In this context, I am concerned about the future of Connolly Barracks in Longford. This barracks, which has been under scrutiny for some time, has a very good record. The closure of Connolly Barracks would be disastrous for the people of Longford. There is a high unemployment rate in the area and businesses rely on the spending power of the personnel working in the barracks.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to outline the improvements which will be carried out on Connolly Barracks. I understand a works programme for the barracks has been prepared for the past two years. However, nothing has been done to implement it. I ask him to confirm when this work, which has been on the long finger for some time, will be carried out.</P>
      <P>Over the past 12 months I have been approached by young men and women who are anxious to join the Army. One Government speaker suggested that we should have compulsory Army service. It is extraordinary to think that no recruitment to the Army is taking place at present. I hope this position will be improved soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the FCA has been diminished in recent years and, as the previous <Col N="1658" /> speaker said, the training course has been cut from two weeks to one week. I hope a decision will be taken to reinstate the traditional two weeks summer camp.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the conditions which apply to members of the Defence Forces on Border duty. This is an area with which I am familiar because Connolly Barracks supply personnel for Border duty. It is only fair that the conditions of troops on the Border should be improved in line with those working elsewhere in the Defence Forces. I hope that this matter, which was highlighted at the conference this week, will be considered by the Minister with a view to improving conditions.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to clarify a number of issues in the course of his reply. I should like him to deal with the suggestion that capping be introduced in the various ranks for promotion purposes, with his proposals on the issue of Border allowance and with the issue of women in the Defence Forces. I was disappointed with the Minister's reply in regard to the latter. Perhaps the Minister of State would give a more positive reply in regard to it.</P>

      <P>I sometimes welcome interventions. I thank those Deputies who contributed to the debate and I appreciate the good wishes expressed by Deputies Taylor-Quinn, O'Sullivan, Gilmore, Clohessy, McEllistrim, Dukes, Power, Coughlan and Belton to the Minister and myself in respect of our work. I thank Deputies, too, and wish to be associated with their expressions of goodwill and appreciation of the work of the various branches of the Defence Forces, work that is appreciated by the Government as a whole. As Deputies have highlighted a number of points, I will try to deal with them as quickly as I can.</P>
      <P>The common question right across the board was the whole area of allowances, particularly in relation to Border duties. Without repeating what the Minister said earlier today about the Gleeson Commission and their indepth study of the whole question of pay and allowances, I would put on the record that this was the first completely independent assessment of this whole area and, as such, deserves much consideration. The Government have considered the matter and are implementing the recommendations of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> On the issue of Border allowances the commission concluded that the fairest approach was to compare the military pay rates with rates in a wide range of other public and private sector employments on the basis of the duties, responsibilities and working conditions they entailed. Specifically, the commission stated that while members of the Defence Forces and the Garda co-operate on a variety of tasks, overall their duties are dissimilar and it is impossible to compare them. As the Deputies know, a conciliation and arbitration scheme is being considered at present and quite a number of meetings have taken place in this regard. We hope that that scheme will put in place the machinery for discussing, and coming to conclusions, on these allowances and that it will be a satisfactory way of resolving the matter. Since the beginning of 1989 the average pay of privates and NCOs has increased by between 45 and 50 per cent. Therefore, the commission was obviously needed. The Government are acting on the recommendations and that has been welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>As regards the Minister's announcement in relation to a wider role for women in the Army, I acknowledge the generous welcome by the spokespersons opposite. I know that Deputy Taylor-Quinn is concerned that this recommendation will not be implemented quickly enough. In his speech, the Minister outlined, and has accepted, the principle of full integration and it is now up to the military authorities to put that in place with the least possible delay. In view of the statement made by the Deputy, I assure her that as far as the Minister and I are concerned there will be no undue delay in implementing that decision. Obviously, there are areas where implementation could take place almost immediately as in the areas of cash escorts and so on, but there are other areas where implementation of the recommendations would prove more difficult. I would ask the Deputy to accept that the decision will be implemented. I am sure that if progress is not satisfactory she will come back to us on that issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" /> On the question of promotions there is a problem, as the Deputy has outlined. We have moved from a system which was almost exclusively based on seniority to a system based on merit. There will be competitions in place in this respect. I realise that the problem referred to by the Deputy is one that has to be tackled. The Minister and the military authorities will be discussing this matter with the representative body, RACO.</P>
    <P>As regards the concern expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan in relation to ex-soldiers, I assure the Deputy that I will be meeting the Organisation of National Ex-servicemen. I have been invited to attend one of their functions at the end of this month, and I will also have a formal meeting with them. As the Deputy acknowledged, once a soldier leaves the Army he is an ex-soldier, a civilian, and much of the problems that have been highlighted are more appropriate to the civilian arena. This whole matter, particularly the question of pensions, was examined by the Gleeson Commission and was favourably commented on. Anything that can be done to ease the transition of soldiers into civilian life will be done by the Army. That is an area that will be kept under observation and I will certainly meet with the ONE to discuss the matter further.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim raised the matter of AIDS and the story carried in yesterday's papers about our UNIFIL personnel. I have been assured that there is no danger of our UNIFIL personnel contracting AIDS as a result of receiving blood transfusions in Lebanon. Blood donors in UNIFIL are taken from the Swedish contingent. All Swedish military personnel who volunteer for service with the UN are required to undergo a HIV test and anyone found to have the AIDS virus is debarred from overseas service. Therefore, any fear in this matter should be allayed.</P>
    <P>The question of Army barracks and accommodation was also mentioned. I assure Deputy Belton that there is no fear of Connolly Barracks in Longford being closed down. Important works are <Col N="1662" /> needed and money will be provided from the Estimate for the necessary repairs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clohessy referred to the FIS scheme. There are very few Army personnel availing of the FIS. The number is in single figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath was in contact with me in relation to Civil Defence, an area for which I have special responsibility. I have studied his submission and I will be speaking with him and with the Opposition spokespersons in the context of a review of Civil Defence. I look forward to an exchange of views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue. It is very difficult to understand the logic of this decision. In announcing the suspension of the scheme the Minister said that the scheme would be restored post-Maastricht in the allocation of new Structural Funds. We are told in the context of the Maastricht debate to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and that these funds will definitely be available. If that is the reality I fail to understand why the rural environment and rural employment prospects should be jeopardised in the interim by suspending the operation of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If unemployment is the biggest single problem confronting the country and if the tourist industry, through the exploitation of our green and unspoilt environment, offers one of the major solutions to this problem, then the decision of the Government to suspend the operation of this scheme to control farmyard pollution is doubly confusing. It is evidence that the Government are turning their back on small farming enterprises by putting <Col N="1663" /> the capacity to rectify pollution problems beyond their control and ensuring a continuation and an acceleration of the already unacceptable trend towards fewer and bigger farm holdings.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the Government's decision is that thousands of jobs will be lost in the construction industry and in the steel shed provision industry and very necessary work to protect the rural environment will be left undone. Many farmers at the smaller end of the scale who are absolutely dependent on grant aid to finance these works will be forced out of farming through Government indifference on the one hand and on the other hand by those vested with carrying out pollution control duties.</P>
    <P>It is essential if the Government are intent on restoring this scheme in the near future that it be done practically immediately. Time is an essential factor in the planning and carrying out of these works in the agricultural diary. There is only a certain period, given that planning procedures take a minimum of two months, within which farming enterprises are in a position to devote time and energy to carrying out these works. It is essential that the scheme be restored immediately.</P>
    <P>What are the consequences if this scheme is not restored? A whole range of necessary rural protection works will be suspended indefinitely and we could have a return to the fish kill seasons which we experienced in the mid-eighties. I appeal to the Minister, as someone who has a good understanding of the rural economy, to restore these grants immediately to protect the environment and to protect scarce jobs. We could do without this poorly thought out suspension of a scheme which has given valuable employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> The scheme for the control of farmyard pollution (CFP) was introduced here in 1989 as an operational programme. The scheme was to last until 1993 and estimated expenditure was £94 <Col N="1664" /> million. A sum of £66.4 million was allocated out of the Structural Funds to finance this expenditure.</P>
      <P>To date 27,000 farmers have applied for the scheme and approvals have issued in 25,000 cases leaving over 2,000 to be dealt with. These approvals exhaust the estimated expenditure of £94 million and the corresponding expenditure of £66.4 million from the Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>It is possible that all the outstanding approvals will not reach completion in which case there would be money available to finance some more approvals. It has been decided therefore to cancel those approvals where the completion date has expired in an effort to find out how many approvals are likely to be completed.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the situation will be clarified inside a month or so. If by then it is established that a certain number of applicants are not going ahead with their approved work additional approvals can be issued.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the importance of this scheme in the control of farmyard pollution and the interest which farmers have in it. For this reason, in the programme being prepared by the Government for submission to the EC for a new allocation of structural funds, additional finance for this scheme will have priority.</P>
      <P>In the meantime work will continue on the 13,000 projects which have been approved but not completed. These outstanding approvals represent an investment of approximately £85 million. It is likely that the completion of these projects will take up to 18 months. While this work continues current levels of employment will be maintained. There is no need therefore for concern on this score for some considerable time. By then it is hoped that the question of EC funds for the continuation of the scheme will have been resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue. I refer to the decision taken by the Minister <Col N="1665" /> to sanction the disposal of 53 acres of Teagasc land at Kinsealy, County Dublin. I have always opposed the disposal of this land and property as its location close to the heartland of the horticultural industry in North County Dublin is invaluable. If the Government were really serious regarding the future development of the horticultural industry and conscious of its employment potential, this land would be retained and fully utilised by the State.</P>
      <P>On Thursday last, 7 May, I asked the Minister if he had satisfied himself that the highest tender received was sufficient to ensure an adequate return to the State. In his reply he stated that there was no reserve price on the land or property and that he was satisfied that the acceptance of the highest tender would provide the best return to the State at present. I ask the Minister to clarify the situation as the dogs in the street seem to know who the purchaser is and what he paid for the property. I would be very happy to hear that this is not correct, particularly as the price mentioned is totally inadequate and if the property was sold at this price it would be an utter scandal.</P>
      <P>From the information available to me I understand that a tender price of £237,000 has been accepted for a detached period residence on 53 acres of probably the best kept land in north County Dublin. It should be noted also that a particular feature of the Georgian residence is a marble fireplace, which is very valuable. If we exclude the Georgian residence, the sale price represents a price of £4,500 an acre. The sale of land at this price per acre is a scandal and I call for an immediate investigation into the deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Teagasc land is zoned for agricultural purposes at present. However, it is located within seven miles of the city centre and some two miles from the popular suburbs of Malahide and Portmarnock, which makes this a most attractive proposition. In 1989 some 6.55 acres of adjoining land owned by Teagasc was disposed of by Teagasc for approximately £120,000 <Col N="1666" /> which works out at approximately £18,000 per acre.</P>
    <P>I am aware that private sites in the immediate area are being sold for £70,000-£80,000 or more. This is a clear indication of the potential of this land. Given that the land is serviced by a main sewage scheme, the sale of just four sites on this land would show an immediate return to the purchaser and he still would have approximately 50 acres of land and a period residence. I must ask the Minister if he knows who the purchaser is, the purchaser's interest in the land and if there is a political dimension to the sale of this land. There is a demand at present throughout north County Dublin for land that is suitable for a golf course. The going rate for agricultural land that can be used for this purpose is between £8,000 and £9,000 per acre.</P>
    <P>From the facts that I have outlined it is clearly obvious that the State has not secured an adequate return for this land. I believe also that the Minister has a case to answer if he approved the sale of this land at such a scandalously low price. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Ryan for raising this issue. At the outset I should say that the land in question at Kinsealy is surplus to the present and future requirements of Teagasc. In accordance with the provisions of the Agriculture (Research Training and Advice) Act, 1988, the approval of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to sell the land was sought and obtained by Teagasc. The land in question is zoned for agricultural purposes.</P>
      <P>I understand from Teagasc that a reputable firm of estate agents was engaged to conduct the sale, which was by public tender. As the Deputy will be aware from a reply by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to a recent parliamentary question, the sale was widely advertised in the normal way including in the press and on site. I understand that the Teagasc Authority have decided to accept the highest offer made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter. I thank the Minister of State for his presence. I have had a number of calls to my home from old age pensioners who had spent their working life in America and Canada and have now returned home to retire. They are in receipt of pensions from the country where they spent their working life but due to the postal strike they have not received them. They are now in the very embarrassing position of having no income. Being returned elderly emigrants they have few family connections and are isolated. They do not want to look for credit in the local shops.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the postal unions have made arrangements to ensure that British pensions and other payments are delivered, but the question of American, Canadian and Australian pensions has been overlooked. The number affected is not large, but those who are are isolated. Is it fair that elderly retired people should be put in this position? These people came home to retire and their contribution to the economy is appreciated. I do not think it is fair that they should suffer, as they should be allowed to live out their retirement in peace and tranquility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his good office <Col N="1668" /> to ensure that these overseas pensions are delivered to them immediately.</P>

      <P>Normal mail deliveries between Ireland and other postal administrations have been suspended for the duration of the postal disruption.</P>
      <P>Once it became clear that United Kingdom pension and other payments to persons resident in this country would be affected by the industrial dispute in An Post, the Department of Social Welfare contacted the Department of Social Security in Newcastle upon Tyne and in Belfast to advise them of the consequences of the dispute and to offer whatever assistance was considered appropriate to their claimants who are resident in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following discussions between the Department of Social Welfare and An Post it was agreed that payments which are normally mailed from Newcastle upon Tyne and Belfast to addressees in Ireland can be placed in the mail in Dublin. Arrangements to have cheques brought from Newcastle upon Tyne and Belfast were completed on 12 May.</P>
      <P>This morning some 5,000 cheque payments for Irish residents were received from Newcastle upon Tyne and a further 200 were received from Belfast. These cover the period from 28 April. The cheques relate to such schemes as old age pensions, retirement pensions, widows benefit, severe disablement allowances, sickness benefit, invalidity benefit, maternity benefit, industrial injuries and industrial death benefit payments.</P>
      <P>An Post have confirmed that these payments will be processed and delivered in the same manner as payments generated in the Department of Social Welfare. This means that United Kingdom payments to persons living in Dublin postal districts 3 to 24 and the rest of the country should be received through the post by next Monday. The unions in An Post are aware of and are co-operating with this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payments for people living in Dublin <Col N="1669" /> postal districts 1 and 2 can be collected tomorrow at a special collection centre which the Department already operate for their own clients at Oisin House, Pearse Street, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>These arrangements are in line with those which apply to cheque payments from the Department of Social Welfare. It is my hope that these arrangements will continue in place until the postal dispute is resolved.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare have not been approached by any other social security administration in relation to payments made through the post to persons who are resident here.</P>
    <P>Deputies will understand that it would not be practicable to quickly introduce arrangements for all overseas payments to residents along the lines I have already outlined. However, I would like to take this opportunity to remind persons who usually receive a social security payment through the post from any other country and who are worrying that their payments may be delayed that they may be entitled to a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. They can attend their local health board office where community welfare officers are available to assist them.</P>
    <P>I would also like to record my appreciation for the efforts made by staff in An Post, the Department of Social Welfare and in the United Kingdom Ministries to minimise the effects of the dispute on old and sick people. Their co-operation and the co-operation extended by the unions in An Post is very welcome in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister for the Marine. This important matter concerns the provision of a coastguard service to replace the lighthouse keeper service when the lighthouses become automatic in a year or two.</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to pay tribute to the great work of our lighthouse keepers down through generations in keeping watch over our coastal territories throughout the country. The Republic has a huge mileage of coastline which will be completely unguarded when the automation of the lighthouses is complete. This will be an invitation to dealers to smuggle in arms and drugs, which will add further to the problem.</P>
      <P>In other countries where lighthouse keepers have been dispensed with and where automation has taken place they have been replaced by a coastguard service. This is something the Department of the Marine should consider as otherwise there will be no surveillance of any description and no control on the movement of ships and yachts which could be involved in the smuggling of drugs and arms into this country. What does the Minister intend to do to fill the vacuum which will be created following the automation of the lighthouses off our coastline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I apologise for the absence of the Minister for the Marine. I give this reply on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for the Marine I am very conscious and appreciative of the sterling work and support the lighthouse keepers of the Commissioners of Irish Lights provided to the search and rescue system in the past and still provide at the remaining six manned lighthouses. The service they provided as coastwatchers and assisting in search and rescue communications was <Col N="1671" /> invaluable before my Department provided a National VHF Communication Network. These services which were provided on a non-statutory and informal basis, as well as being secondary to their official duties, are therefore all the more deserving of our appreciation.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had no coastguard service as such since the foundation of the State in 1922 and over the years there have been calls for such a service to be established. My Department's coast and cliff rescue service, which was founded in 1923 as the coast lifesaving service, exists as the successor to the old United Kingdom coastguard in Ireland in so far as its coastal rescue function is concerned. Other functions of the old coastguard such as search and rescue co-ordination and communications were taken over by other bodies.</P>
    <P>Almost all of the functions of a coastguard are performed by existing services and are the responsibility of my Department. For example, the task of co-ordinating marine search and rescue in Ireland is undertaken by the marine rescue co-ordination centre at Shannon, the coast and cliff rescue service is responsible for coastal search and rescue. Radio communications are provided by the coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head through their 11 remotely controlled VHF stations.</P>
    <P>The only remaining function of a coastguard which is not provided by the State is that of maintaining a continuous visual coast watch. However there is a VHF network and almost every water craft has a radio. In addition the coast and cliff rescue service carry out bad weather visual watches and distress vessel visual <Col N="1672" /> watches around the coast as part of their duties whenever the need is identified.</P>
    <P>The Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre and the coast radio stations are 24 hour manned services and their functions are being brought together with the Volunteer Coast and Cliff Rescue Service in the Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department. This service under its Director is now responsible for search and rescue, counter pollution response, casualty and salvage around our coast. I will be advised by the Irish Marine Emergency Service of any further needs in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little disappointed with the Minister's reply because he did not get the gist of my question. My question related to unauthorised craft which will have free access to our ports because of lack of vigilance. Those unauthorised craft could land arms, drugs and so on because there would be nobody to keep vigilance on that type of activity which will increase as a result of the termination of the lighthouse keeper service.</P>

    <P>I would also refer the Deputies to the package of measures to remedy inequities in existing students support schemes which has already been announced and which provides for a number of important changes to be introduced as and from the 1992 Higher Education Grants Scheme, including: the income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education; and income eligibility will be assessed on both the income and income limits of the year of entry to third level rather than as heretofore, the income <Col N="1596" /> limits in the year in which the students sat the Leaving Certificate.</P>

      <P>My Department's third level ongoing capital programme is targeted at ensuring that an equitable provision of capital resources are provided nationally. The total cost of the present programme which covers the period 1990 to 1993 is approximately £100 million, of which about £55 million is being expended outside the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the programme include the provision of additional places which will allow an increase in the admission rate to third level from 39 per cent to 45 per cent of the relevant age group and the provision of facilities for research and higher level programmes which will contribute to economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware from the Clancy report the rates of admission to third level from the Dublin area were virtually the lowest in the country and projects such as Tallaght R.T.C. have been provided to remedy this imbalance. The current third level capital programme is the largest embarked on for <Col N="1606" /> many years and it is my intention to ensure that all institutions and regions continue to receive an equitable level of investment in the future.</P>

      <P>In the case of national schools, the information requested by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the number of new remedial posts allocated to a particular area in any given period will be affected by the extent to which the needs of the area have already been addressed in earlier allocations of such posts.</P>
      <P>In the case of Cork City, I would point out that 85 per cent of the city's national schools now enjoy a remedial teaching service and that this level of service is substantially above the national average.</P>
      <P>With regard to post-primary schools, it is open to school authorities to appoint remedial teachers within quota. However, the records of my Department do not reveal the number of such appointments made at post-primary level in Cork City during the years mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the 1991/92 school year a total of 16 Remedial and 2 Remedial/Guidance <Col N="1608" /> posts in excess of the quota were allocated to schools in Cork City. This figure includes 4 Remedial and 2 Remedial/ Guidance posts which were allocated for the first time in the 1984/85 to 1987/88 school years.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme for providing additional teaching posts to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas, six schools in Cork City have been allocated an additional post in the past two years. The school authorities were exhorted to consider using this additional resource to provide remedial help to the children in these schools and to develop a home/school liaison programme.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a recent parliamentary question, there is an acknowledged problem of adult illiteracy, in particular, that of functional illiteracy, in all developed countries. There is no evidence to show that the position in Ireland differs significantly from that in other member states in the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the nature of literacy skills there are considerable technical difficulties <Col N="1618" /> in estimating the level of illiteracy in any country at any particular time. There are no official estimates of the incidence of illiteracy in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Addressing literacy problems is an element of general education and training programme and of programmes provided by grant-aided voluntary organisations. In addition my Department's Adult Literacy and Community Education Scheme is a specific programme which is aimed at combating adult literacy. The provision in 1992 for the ongoing services provided under this scheme is £1 million. A further £290,000 is being provided under this scheme for special initiatives for disadvantaged adults, including literacy. An amount of £77,000 is being provided for the National Adult Literacy Agency. It is not possible to disaggregate the costs of the literacy elements in the other programmes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>My Department recognises the problem of adult literacy and is committed to taking the necessary action. As I previously indicated, I shall be announcing new initiatives in this area in the forthcoming Green Paper.</P>

      <P>The rate of <i>per capita</i> grant in secondary schools was £140 between 1987 and 1989 inclusive. It was increased to its present level of £150 from January, 1990. However, commencing in September 1992, an additional capitation grant will be progressively introduced for the larger secondary schools geared towards meeting the cost of caretakers and clerical assistants. This additional grant will amount to £50 per pupil as secondary level in qualifying schools.</P>
      <P>The rates of the <i>per capita</i> grants will be considered in the light of an examination currently being undertaken of unit costs at post-primary level.</P>

      <P>In July, 1989, all second-level schools were informed of the intention to introduce a new Technology programme on a phased basis in a selected number of schools in the 1989-90 school-year, and to extend the option progressively in <Col N="1620" /> subsequent years to other schools. It was to be a developmental programme which would be amended or refined in the light of experience. The number of schools at present approved by the Department to include Technology in their programme is 148.</P>
      <P>In the introduction of the Education Green Paper, I stated that throughout the second-level programme, at both Junior and Senior Cycles, there will be a major initiative to increase awareness of technology and enterprise among young people. A new subject, Enterprise and Technology studies, structured on a modular basis, would be mandatory for all students.</P>
      <P>In addition it is proposed to develop a broader base of technical subjects at the Leaving Certificate Programme, the central feature of which is the study of technological subjects.</P>

      <P>As stated on a number of previous occasions, I have made it a priority, since taking office. to secure the long term future of our natural gas industry.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, I have obtained Government approval for the construction by Bord Gáis Éireann of a subsea interconnector, linking our gas grid at North County Dublin with that of the UK in southern Scotland. This project is on schedule for completion in October 1993. When completed, it will give us added security of supply, both from having a second pipeline into our gas grid, and access to further supplies into the long term future, after the decline of the Kinsale reserves. In the meantime, Bord Gáis Éirann plans to purchase back-up supplies of gas pending its entry into longer term conracts late in the decade.</P>
      <P>The interconnector project is receiving grant aid equivalent to approximately 35 per cent of eligible expenditure from the European Community under its REGEN Initative.</P>
      <P>In addition, I entered into a five year exploration agreement with the Marathon company in December of last year under which Marathon will drill seven exploration wells in our offshore and acquire 4,000 Km of seismic data, in the period 1992-1996.</P>

    <P>Current measures in hand to enhance the finding of more indigenous gas reserves are the inclusion in this year's Finance Bill of a regime of taxation specific to the petroleum and exploration sector and the review of Ireland's Offshore Licensing Terms.

      <P>The Local Government Act, 1991 sets out a framework within which the preparations for, and the transition towards, the establishment of the new councils in Dublin can take place. This involves the establishment of three area committees by Dublin County Council, the appointment of three area managers and the preparation of a reorganisation report jointly by the area managers in consultation with the area committees and the Dublin City and County Manager. Preparation of this report has commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Copies of the reorganisation report are to be submitted to the Minister and to the Dublin authorities, who may make submissions to the Minister. Under the Act, it is only when he has considered this report that the Minister could make Regulations to give effect to necessary preparations for the estabishment of the new councils. Following this, further primary legislation will be required to provide for the formal establishment of the <Col N="1633" /> new county councils and the abolition of the existing county council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation. It is my intention that this should happen as soon as possible once the necessary preparations have been made.</P>
