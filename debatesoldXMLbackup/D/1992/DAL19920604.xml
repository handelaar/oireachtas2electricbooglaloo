      <P>I seek your permission for the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to raise the urgent and important matter of providing financial assistance to the Olympic Council of Ireland to enable them to fund the final preparation of athletes in advance of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona and to organise adequate funding for the Olympic Games in future years.  Dáil Éireann will note that the national lottery was established to fund activities of this kind.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 10 and 4, Votes 42 and 43, and that No. 4 shall be taken at 3.45 p.m.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Votes 42 and 43, shall be debated together and shall be decided by one question, which shall be put not later than 5 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the debate: (i) The speech of the Minister and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael and Labour Parties shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case and the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed five minutes; (ii) A Minister of State may be called on a second time to make a speech in reply; (iii) A Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate to make a speech in reply, which shall not exceed ten minutes; and (iv) In the five minutes preceding such reply, Opposition spokespersons may request the Minister to clarify specific issues during the course of his reply; (2) The Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.; (3) In respect of tomorrow's business, which shall be Votes 26, 27, 28, 29, 38 and 39, (i) Votes 26, 27, 28 and 29 shall be debated together and decided by one question, which shall be put not later than 1.30 p.m.; (ii) Votes 38 and 39 shall be debated together and shall be decided by one question, which shall be put not later than 4 p.m.; (iii) The aforementioned arrangements for debate in respect of Votes 42 and 43 shall also apply save that the speech of the Minister and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael and Labour Parties shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case and the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes, and (4) Any divisions demanded tomorrow or on any Estimate today shall be postponed until 6.20 p.m. on Wednesday, 10 June 1992 and shall be taken in the chronological order in which they are demanded.</P>

      <P>Are the proposals <Col N="1467" /> for dealing with Votes 42 and 43 today agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal that the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and adjourn at 4 p.m. agreed? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with Votes 26, 27, 28, 29, 38 and 39 tomorrow agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow, under the order before us, it is proposed to deal with the Estimates for the Department of Education and for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In view of the need for a full debate &mdash; which has not taken place &mdash; on the implications of the Danish referendum, tomorrow's debate should be confined exclusively to Foreign Affairs to enable Members who were not allowed to speak yesterday an opportunity to speak on this matter.  To achieve that I propose that we delete reference in tomorrow's order to Votes 26, 27, 28 and 29, the Votes for the Department of Education, hereby leaving only the Department of Foreign Affairs' Votes to be dealt with tomorrow.  Consequent on that I propose that paragraph (1) of item (3), which refers to the Department of Education Estimates, to be deleted, leaving us to deal tomorrow with Votes 38 and 39, the Department of Foreign Affairs' Votes.  A full debate tomorrow on that matter would be extremely valuable and would allow many Members, who were concerned about not having an opportunity to speak yesterday, to do so.  A further consideration is that the Minister for Education will not be here tomorrow to take the debate, which is fortuitous, and will help the Government to agree to allow the Department of Foreign Affairs' Vote to be the sole Vote taken tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I find myself in some difficulty in respect of the type of amendments being put to the House.  I should remind the House that it is the Taoiseach's prerogative under Standing Order 25 to list the items of business to be taken each day.  Any amendment to delete an item of business announced by the Taoiseach is not in order.  What the <Col N="1468" /> House may do, has been doing, and has a right to do is to amend any proposal of the business by modifying the arrangements for taking that business.  However, to delete the business or any part of it as announced by the Taoiseach is not in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to your ruling, Sir, which I accept, I propose that the discussion on Votes 26, 27, 28 and 29 be taken tomorrow without debate.  The debate could take place later, thereby allowing the sole business to be debated tomorrow &mdash; as distinct from being taken &mdash; to be Votes 38 and 39.  It would facilitate my proposal and would allow the Estimates for the Department of Education, which would be technically taken tomorrow, to be debated at a later stage and this would comply with your ruling.</P>

      <P>I am trying to live within the Taoiseach's prerogative.

      <P>I fully support the excellent proposal made by Deputy Bruton, particularly in view of the developments overnight where it is clear that the European Commission at least is attempting to isolate Denmark.  It is <Col N="1469" /> important for the House to put on record that our Government will not seek to isolate Denmark or to gang up against them with the Euro bullies.  It is important to debate these issues in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the continuous demands from the Opposition parties to signal well in advance a programme for debating the Estimates, we have done so.  In relation to the points raised by the various leaders this morning about an opportunity to debate, they will have an opportunity to do so for two-and-a-half hours tomorrow.  In line with the commitment I gave the House yesterday, I will ask the Whips to arrange for a further debate next week when we will all be better informed.  That will ensure a better balance and it will be more appropriate then.</P>

      <P>I yield to no Deputy in this House in my support for the Maastricht <Col N="1470" /> Treaty.  However, the Government should, in the interests of a speedy and effective passage of the Maastricht Treaty, allow as full a debate as possible as quickly as possible.  &ldquo;As soon as possible&rdquo; is tomorrow, not next week.  Therefore, my proposal should be accepted by the Taoiseach and I propose to continue with it if the Taoiseach is unwilling to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was questioned in the House yesterday about when Ireland would introduce legislation to comply with a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  He indicated that this legislation was low on the priority list of the Department of Justice in regard to law reform.  I want to inquire about this priority list.  On 7 May the Minister for Justice said that he had the following items of legislation in preparation: the Extradition Bill, a Bill on juvenile Justice; a Bill on the confiscation <Col N="1473" /> of the proceeds of crime; a Bill on criminal insanity, a Bill on suicide and another on the miscarriage of justice.  Can I take it that the legislation to implement the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights comes seventh on the list after those six items, or can the Taoiseach indicate exactly what is the order of priority as far as this list of legislation is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The items I mentioned yesterday are top of the priority list. Thereafter we will decide the priority as we go along.  Other Bills mentioned by the Deputy are at different stages of preparation.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Taoiseach said yesterday that there was a priority list?  Obviously, if there is a priority list that is a list in order.  He is now saying that perhaps there is not a priority list, that these things are decided as they go along.  Which is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I said at all.  I said quite clearly that the two items the Government wanted from the Department of Justice &mdash; the first being the home ownership Bill and the second, the White Paper on Marital Breakdown &mdash; were top priority as far as the Government were concerned with everything else taking its place in the order of preparation and as advanced by the relevant Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I seek some clarification from the Taoiseach?  I now understand that there is the prospect of a debate next week, but the statements of the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday contained absolutely no attempt to inform us of the legal position in relation to the conflict and difficulties we now face in regard to the referendum on 18 June.  Will the Taoiseach <Col N="1474" /> assure the House that on the next occasion this matter is debated in the House we will have a statement from the Government as to the exact legal status of the Maastricht Treaty in the aftermath of its rejection by the Danes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday, and I repeat, that we will keep the House and the people of the country informed of all information as it comes into our possession. I might remind the Deputy and the House that I have said on a number of occasions that if other parties opted not to stay with the mainstream of European development and integration, it was open to the other eleven or ten parties to sit down and agree the same provisions that exist in the Maastricht Treaty, or a new treaty, call it what you will.  I said that that was an option available to the other member states if they so wished. Indeed, I might say to the Deputy that it is politicians who have built Europe and not lawyers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to avoid argument. Surely the Taoiseach must realise that what will be before the people on 18 June, Part I, is that the State may ratify the Treaty on European Union signed at Maastricht on 7 February 1992 and may become a member of that union.  In the wake of the Danish decision, effectively that union cannot be complete without the Danes.  Surely the Taoiseach must accept that all we will be doing now on 18 June is that we will be giving a signal that we are in favour of European integration but that it must be in some other form?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is a legal solution to this dilemma along the lines I indicated in my contribution on the subject yesterday? It would be helpful if the Government, and indeed the heads of other Governments, were to meet and state authoritatively what legal course will be followed?  Would he agree that the continuance of bland assurances without well-argued legal explanations creates unnecessary uncertainty?  Would the Taoiseach agree that he would be well advised &mdash; either he himself or, preferably, <Col N="1476" /> in conjunction with the heads of the other eleven member states &mdash; to state clearly how the Community intends to deal with this problem legally, as I believe can be done?</P>

      <P>I might seek some clarification on the Programme for Government, in particular the position in regard to legislation in the area of extradition.  As Deputy John Bruton said, the Taoiseach indicated that there was a Bill in preparation with regard to extradition.  Would the Taoiseach say whether it is intended to introduce one comprehensive amending, Bill?  Furthermore would he say whether the Government have abandoned the interim measure dealing with section 5 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, which was to allow for the extraterritorial trial of Irish citizens who commit crimes in other countries as opposed to extradition?  That was indicated in the Programme for Government as an interim measure apart from any other amending legislation.  Would the Taoiseach please clarify the position in that regard?</P>

      <P>In our amendment No. 44 we seek to delete &ldquo;15&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;18&rdquo; as the number of ordinary members on the governing body of a college.  In the Bill as drafted, section 6 (2) (a) provided that the governing body of a college shall consist of a chairman and 15 ordinary members, but subsequent amendments, tabled by the Opposition parties, suggested the number should range from 18, as Deputy Ahearn and I suggested, to 19, as Deputy Mac Giolla suggested.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were circulated with ministerial amendment No. 42 which proposed to increase he number to 22, but we were then circulated with mendment No. 43a, a ministerial amendment, which proposed to substitute &ldquo;16&rdquo; in place of both &ldquo;15&rdquo; and &ldquo;22&rdquo;.  The Minister has suggested that the number of ordinary members on the governing body should be 15, 22 and now 16.</P>
      <P>The governing body is a key instrument in the success of the college as it oversees the day-to-day operation of the college. It should be as large and representative as possible without being unwieldy.  We were pleasantly surprised when the Minister went further than us and increased the number of ordinary members to 22, allowing for a knock-on increase in representation by the various component bodies of the governing body.  One is reminded of Lanigan's Ball: First, a membership of 15 was proposed, then 22, and now 16.  I urge the Minister to move his amendment that the membership be increased to 22.  This would allow for the various increases in membership and the dual sex representation proposed by us in a late amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 42 was tabled by the former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern.  There are a number of fundamental changes in the present Minister's amendment.  For example, it is proposed to change the Second Schedule of the Bill.  The former Minister's amendment proposed that the governing body of a college should consist of 22 members including the director, <Col N="1482" /> one of whom, other than the director, would be elected to be chairman as provided for in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  Under the present Minister's amendment the proposal for the election of the chairman by the governing body and the recommendation made by the vocational education committee to the Minister in regard to the nominated person will be removed.  This is an outright attack on local democracy and the local education system.  In other words, the appointment of the chairman will be centralised in Marlborough Street and it will be on the direction of the Minister.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Labour Party I regard as reprehensible the proposal to exclude from the governing body the one person to be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  A later amendment in my name proposes that a member of the FIE should be nominated to the governing body.  This amendment was tabled to achieve balance.  The Labour Party recognise that while the general trade union movement in a region should be represented it is also important that the employer interests be represented. The proposal to exclude the person to be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is an outright attack on the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear at this stage whether there will be one or two teacher representatives on the governing body.  If I recall correctly, the then Minister Deputy Davern, proposed in his amendment that there should be two teacher representatives on the governing body.  The Minister should make a very definite distinction between teacher representatives and a representative of the general trade union movement.  The general trade union movement are involved in much more than the educational area and educational trade unionism <i>per se</i>.  The Minister will be aware that trades councils in the south-east region have played a very positive role in many developments.  For example, they have played an important role in the development of Waterford Airport and the sports complex in my area.  I understand the Minister has an interest in this complex and that he <Col N="1483" /> recently visited it.  The proposal to exclude the ICTU representative from the governing body is unthinkable, and I will certainly push my amendment to a vote when we reach it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins said, we are not clear as to the intention of the Minister in this respect.  The former Minister for Education proposed to increase the number of vocational education committee members on the governing body, but it is now proposed to leave that membership at the level initially proposed in the Bill.  This is an attack on organised labour on the one hand and local democracy on the other.  The amendments dealing with the composition of the governing body bring us to the very kernel of the Bill and the changes which have been made to it.  This Bill is not the Bill introduced by Deputy O'Rourke or the Bill pursued by Deputy Davern during their terms as Minister for Education.  It is a totally new Bill.  Concerns raised are about the leak in relation to the Green Paper that the Government intend to completely remove vocational education committees from the scene.  I want to repeat that at the end of the day vocational education committees are the only democratic educational administration bodies in the State.  We seem to be moving towards Thatcherism in this area.  In this respect, I wish to enter a caveat to the officials in the Department of Education.  The problems which exist in Britain in this area are proof positive that the road followed by the Tories is not the road leading to a proper educational system, a liberal spread in curriculum content, the full development of individuals and all that goes with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to explain to us why the Bill presented to this House by the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, has been changed totally in character.  The legalities in relation to the explanatory memorandum also bear examination.  I believe that the link with the vocational education committee is effectively being broken.  I will be pursuing the amendment in the names of Deputy Higgins and myself.  The removal <Col N="1484" /> of the election of the chairman from the democratic process and the fact that the representative of organised labour will no longer have a place as of right on the governing body, if the Minister's amendment is accepted, is a retrograde step and an ideological step in the same direction as other Government decisions on economic policy.  Such measures will be greatly to the detriment of our educational system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The change of Ministers becomes clearer with each amendment put down by this Minister. The attack on the vocational education committees is evident in that the original draft by the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, provided that the first members other than the director of the governing body of the college shall be persons appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the vocational education committee, but the present Minister has deleted that provision.  I suggested on Second Stage that the members be appointed by the vocational education committee.  For the Minister to appoint the members on the recommendation of the vocational education committee would give some credibility and power to the vocational education committees. The present Minister, Deputy Brennan, is providing that the Minister would have total control.  He would not have to seek a recommendation from the vocational education committee; they would not even be asked for their opinion.  That is the whole thrust of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in the original draft of the Bill Deputy O'Rourke provided, under section 6 (4), that upon the expiration of the term of office of the first ordinary members, the ordinary members of a governing body shall be appointed by the Minister, on the recommendation of the vocational education committee.  That provision was not changed by her successor, Deputy Davern, but it has been deleted by this Minister &mdash; amendment 53a in the name of the Minister proposed to delete &ldquo;on the recommendation of the vocational education committee&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Davern was Minister he <Col N="1485" /> made substantial amendments for the better in regard to representation on the govening body, retaining the power of the vocational education committee.  He amended the numbers of persons to be nominated by the vocational education committee from six to eight, of whom at least five shall be elected representatives. The present Minister proposes that at least three shall be elected representatives of local authorities.  Therefore, there are changes all round.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Shea said, it is difficult to understand why the terms of the Bill in regard to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are being altered to provide that one person would be nominated by them. In the Minister's amendments there is a definite trend towards removal of democratic control and trade union influence. This gives a whole new context to the Bill.  The third level education system is being substantially altered in all these amendments by a Minister who sees any type of democratic or local control as being anathema and going totally against the grain.  The Minister wants to retain control over all aspects of the colleges, from the governing body to courses and degrees, and this is evident in every amendment tabled by him.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to the thrust of these amendments.  Under the last Minister we felt we could have dealt with the Bill rapidly because there was consensus between Minister and Opposition.  Under that Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, there was also a tendency to make changes and she agreed with certain suggestions, but this Minister does not want to listen to any suggestions.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is not here to show whether he has flexibility. Up to now there has been inflexibility in regard to suggested improvements to the Bill, improvements that have been sought by many people involved in education, particularly in vocational education. Everybody who is interested in this matter, including parents, have made suggestions in regards to the Bill.  We looked forward very much to the passing of these Bills in which, we hoped, greater flexibility and autonomy would be given <Col N="1486" /> to the colleges while retaining local control and input.  A great asset of the vocational system was that there was local community input and each region knew what was best for its own area. However, this is being gradually whittled down in this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to consider with a more open mind the amendments to broaden the scope of the governing body and to ensure that interests are properly represented.</P>
    <P>One of the amendments in my name proposes greater representation by the academic staff.  Amendment 60 proposes that the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; be changed to &ldquo;elected&rdquo;.  I am proposing that three people be nominated although the Minister is insisting that there be only one person.  When Deputy Davern was Minister he proposed to increase the number of academic staff to two persons.  I am a little confused in that I do not know whether the Minister agrees to that provision. However, regardless of what number is decided upon I would ask the Minister to ensure that the academic representatives on the governing body be elected by the staff.  To nominate staff in accordance with regulations made by the governing body would seem to be a self-perpetuating system in that the governing body could ensure that they select the members of the academic staff.  Surely we should be promoting democracy at local and college levels to ensure harmony among the staff and the governing body.  We should ensure that members of the academic staff on the governing body are elected rather than nominated.  Basically what I and other Oposition Deputies are proposing is a more broadly based governing body with more representation and more democracy in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in numbers and the lack of clarification could have serious consequences for other amendments tabled by Deputy Higgins and myself, particularly amendments Nos. 61 to 65.  The Minister in clarifying said that 22 would make it unwieldly, but he failed to tell us exactly how many of the 16 will be representative of academic staff, other staff and students.  The reason <Col N="1487" /> I stress this point is that we have tabled amendments increasing the representation of the academic staff from one to two, other staff from one to two and students from one to two.  We added a further amendment to those three amendments stating that one at least must be a woman.  We will be pursuing these amendments.</P>
      <P>The composition of a governing body gives us a golden opportunity to give equal representation to women.  People at large believe that from primary education to third level education women do not have their just representation at the highest levels of power.  The representation of women principals in our primary school system is deplorable, despite the fact that over 80 per cent of the staff are women.  The same story applies to our secondary schools.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to give equal representation to women in our third level education institutions.  At the moment the higher levels of power in our third level institutions are dominated by men.  I appeal to the Minister to use this opportunity.  We should not be afraid to discriminate positively in favour of women.  It is the only way they will get adequate representation.  Despite many calls for equal and just representation, this has not happened throughout the system.  There are no women presidents of universities.  How many heads of departments are women?  There are few. How many principals of RTCs are women?  The system has evolved ignorning the right of women to be represented at those levels.  It cannot be claimed that women have neither the calibre nor the capacity to occupy these positions.  It has been proved that women have the talents but do not have the opportunities to fill these positions.  The Minister has a perfect opportunity at this stage of the Bill to ensure that women will be represented. In the academic staff it is not too much to ask that we have two representatives, one of which is a woman. The same applies to students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment tabled by the Minister is proof of this Government's attitude <Col N="1488" /> towards equality.  They give it lip service but stand back from making a definite decision to ensure that women will be rightly represented.  The Minister's amendment No 72a, tabled in response to our amendments I am sure, reads that:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented and shall ensure an appropriate gender balance as determined by the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <P>Would anybody object to 50 per cent representation?  Why does the Minister have to say &ldquo;an appropriate balance&rdquo;. The appropriate balance is that one at least must be a woman.  The amendment says that the Minister will determine this from time to time.  Surely now is the time to ensure that we give equal representation to women on the governing body.  I appeal to the Minister to forget about lip service and make a definite statement in favour of representation of women on the governing body.</P>
    <P>Our amendments should be accepted. I appeal for a generous response.  It is not too much to ask.  What we are doing is putting into reality what the Government are saying.  Despite many appeals for fair and equal representation, experience has taught us that it will not happen.  The statistics speak for themselves.  The time has come to have the courage to take a positive step to ensure that women will be properly represented on the governing body.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Mac Giolla in seeking democracy in representation.  Staff cannot nominate somebody, they must elect somebody.  From representations I received from the staff of the colleges I know that they want the powers to elect. They do not want to be left with the very difficult decision of nomination.  If we believe in democracy we must ensure that it exists at all levels of life.  I appeal to the Minister to accept these reasonable amendments.  We will be pushing the amendments for equal and fair representation for women.</P>

      <P>The governing body now proposed will comprise the chairman and <Col N="1489" /> director, six vocational education committee nominees, two academic staff, one non-academic staff, two students, five nominees of organisations the vocational education committee consider require representation having regard to the courses in the college, who shall be representative of industry, agriculture, commerce, the professions and other interests appropriate to the college.</P>
      <P>A question was raised on the appointment of the chairman.  The current proposal with regard to the Minister appointing the chairman is in line with the original Bill, apart from the recommendations of the vocational education committee.  This is the only position which will be nominated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to staff members on the governing body and how they will be nominated.  The Bill says that they will be nominated by the staff.  It will be a matter for the staff to decide a method of selection.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla in his amendment No. 43, Deputies O'Shea, Higgins and Ahearn in amendment No. 44 and Deputy Garland in his amendment No. 45 all seek to increase the size of the governing body proposed in the Bill as initiated. The main issues in question here are the number of academic staff and student representatives.  Strong representation has been made in this regard and following consideration of the matter I have decided to increase the representation for both from one to two.  My amendments Nos. 43a, 48, 58, 64 and 197 provide for these and consequential changes.</P>

    <P>In considering this matter and amendment No. 66 from Deputies O'Shea and Garland, which proposed the inclusion of a nominee of the Federation of Irish Employers, I concluded that it was undesirable to specify any particular organisation in this way.  I was anxious to increase the representation of the staff and students without allowing the governing body to become too large and unwieldy.  Taking these matters into account, I have removed the specific reference to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with amendment No. 65a and equally I will not be accepting amendment <Col N="1490" /> No. 66 from Deputies O'Shea and Garland.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Shea and Garland in their amendments Nos. 46, 53, 74, 183 and 188 propose that the governing body should be appointed by the vocational education committee.  This was not intended and would be very much out of line with procedure for governing bodies in other third level institutions.  I am not prepared to accept these amendments and propose to go further in order to remove any ambiguity on this matter.  Accordingly my amendments Nos. 46a, 53a, 74a, and consequential amendments 188a, 189a 189b in the Second Schedule remove the provision in the Bill as published that members of a governing body would have to be recommended by the vocational education committee before appointment by the Minister.  This was an unnecessary additional layer in the appointment process and the simplification now being put into place will also remove any ambiguity in this matter. Amendment No. 50 is a drafting amendment to improve the wording in subsection (4).</P>
    <P>My amendments Nos. 183a, 183b, 184, 184a and 184b are related to the amendments I have just outlined but relate in this case to the office of chairman.  Again, I have been anxious to clarify the intent on this matter but I also took other matters into account in clarifying that the chairman would be a ministerial appointee.  I am conscious that the chairman appointed to any body or board has the potential to lend essential status to that body.  I was anxious, therefore, in the interests of these fledgling governing bodies that the widest possible range of persons should be considered for appointment.  This is in line with the position in other third level institutions.  I will, of course, in making their appointments consider with the greatest care any recommendations the vocational education committees may wish to make on individual appointments.  They are particularly well placed in this regard.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 56, which provides that at least three vocational education committee nominees shall be members <Col N="1491" /> of a local authority, I have sought to meet the concerns of those Deputies who expressed reservations about the elimination of input from democratically-elected representatives.  This, together with the significant representation of the vocational education committee on the governing body, should allay fears in that regard.  I will not, therefore, be accepting amendment No. 54 from Deputies Higgins and Ahearn.</P>
    <P>I could not accept amendment No. 56 from Deputies O'Shea and Garland which proposes to reduce the vocational education committee nominees from six to four.  Neither could I accept amendment No. 57 from the same Deputies as it seems to assume that the region served by each college will consist of exactly six vocational education committees.  The Deputies' amendment No. 68 is related and I will not be accepting it.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 61, 63 and 65 from Deputies Higgins and Ahearn raise the important matter of a balanced representation on the governing body from each sex.  I share the Deputies' concern in this regard but I am reluctant to deal with the matter as proposed by the Deputies.  Instead, I am proposing in amendment No. 72a to place a duty on the Minister to have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented on the governing bodies and to ensure an appropriate gender balance.  I am going further on this matter by providing in section 7 that the governing bodies also will be required to have regard to gender equity in education.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 60 from Deputy Mac Giolla and amendment No. 61 from Deputies Higgins and Ahearn, I should point out that the purpose of subsection (4) (c) as it is worded is for the academic staff to be afforded the opportunity to decide themselves on the method by which they will be represented, as is the case in the two new universities in Dublin and Limerick. Accordingly, I would be opposed to imposing conditions which could preempt a decision by the academic staff. There is a problem too that amendment <Col N="1492" /> No. 61 has proposed the phrase, &ldquo;one of whom shall be a woman&rdquo;, would apply to the governing body as a whole rather than the academic staff representatives as was the obvious intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has clarified matters but has not allayed our anxieties and fears.  The size, scope and composition of the governing body is the kernel of this Bill.  Unless we get the governing body right in terms of size and composition of the governing body is a suitable chairman by a suitable method, the Bill will be flawed.  We cannot understand why there has been such a policy of retrenchment in relation to giving powers to governing bodies and giving the vocational education committees the linkages contained within the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister sought to allay our fears by saying that he wants a chairman who will be appointed by him and who will have the status for the job.  That is an insult to the governing body, who will be people of the highest calibre because the nominating bodies will be conscious of the need to nominate only the best people.  The Minister's position smacks very much of another case of jobs for the boys.  The Minister said in relation to the appointment of the chairman that this was the only area in which he was taking unto himself the power of appointment. That is not the position.  The amendments he circulated yesterday provide for the deletion in several places in the Bill of phrases such as &ldquo;on the recommendation of the vocational education committee&rdquo; and &ldquo;recommended by a vocational education committee&rdquo;.  Reference to a mere recommendation by a vocational education committee is to be removed. Power is to be centralised in the Minister. The Government claim that one of the central planks of Government policy is decentralisation.  The decentralisation of power to local authorities has been nothing but a meaningless cliché.  What we have is central Government locally administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational education committees have stood the test of time.  Since 1930 they have pioneered the only really <Col N="1493" /> democratic management of education. One would imagine, seeing the way their powers have been culled and whittled away, that they had been errant, reckless and irresponsible.  I defy the Minister to point to any serious misdemeanour on the part of any vocational education committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">

      <P>The implications are that they are not capable of making a token recommendation.  We are not seeking to provide that the Minister must take on board the recommendation made by the vocational education committee.  We are seeking to provide that the Minister would take cognisance of a vocational education committee recommendation. The people who pioneered technical education, starting from small beginnings in difficult times, in many cases travelling around rural Ireland by bicycle building up a substantial body of education which is very much in line with current thinking here and within the EC generally, are being sidelined.  The Minister rules OK.</P>
      <P>This approach completely undermines the so-called openness in Government preached by the various proponents of the stop-start Green Paper.  Minister O'Rourke wanted a great national debate in which there would be participation and openness, leading to consensus of proposals which would form the basis of an Education Bill.  We had the same thing during the brief tenure of Minister Davern.  Much has been said about his so-called lack of qualifications for the Education portfolio but in relation to vocational education he had a particular empathy, sensitivity and feel for it.  He showed that in the person he appointed to be his special adviser and in putting his imprint on the Green Paper and on this Bill.  It is obvious that the present Minister does not have a feel for or a sensitivity to education and he is not worried about democracy in education.  He is worried about centralising powers in Marlborough Street.  He shows scant regard for vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> The preamble to the Green Paper which was given by the Minister to the teacher conferences contained an assurance that the vocational education committees would remain.  On the other hand, the Minister's thinking on the role of vocational education committees augurs a black day.  This is not a Green Paper which is about to emerge, it is a black paper, where the powers of the vocational education committees are literally being whittled away.  We are all blowing hot and cold about enhancing the role of the vocational education committees but all this is negatived, neutralised and rendered meaningless in the thrust of this Bill.  Instead of an open, receptive approach to education we now have a closed mind and a closed door policy in relation to greater participation by the people, by the elected representatives and vocational education committees in particular.  What we are doing is going through the pretence of a great national debate while at the same time forcing through this House measures which would render meaningless the role of the vocational education committees.  They cannot even be trusted to make a recommendation &mdash; that is all that is involved here.  The Minister may or may not take on board the recommendations.</P>
    <P>Amendment 47a, which seeks to delete paragraph (f), is a retrograde step.  ICTU are the umbrella organisation which pull together all the various strands of industrial relations in this country.  It is very important that they are not just included in a general provision further on in the Bill.  It is important that they be included as a specific body, nominated and specified in their own right.  It is important, therefore, that that particular section remain.</P>
    <P>I fully support the points made by my colleague, Deputy Therese Ahearn, in relation to the need for gender equity.  I thank the Minister for acknowledging that there was some substance and merit in what we are proposing.  Amendment 82 in the name of the Minister states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1495" /> In performing its functions a governing body shall have regard to the attainment of gender equity and of equality of opportunity in education.</P>
    <P>It is a move in the right direction but it is more a general statement of principle that one would find in a preamble rather than in an actual section in the Bill.  I believe it contains a certain amount of jargon.  Words such as &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo; are open to interpretation.</P>
    <P>We need a stronger, more substantial, more definitely defined role for women, we need to specify that at least one member shall be a woman.  It is important, in view of the statistics outlined by Deputy Therese Ahearn in relation to the huge imbalance in promotions as against the actual number of women working in education in relation not only to prin-cipalships and vice-principalships &mdash; as statistics will bear out &mdash; in primary schools, in all second level schools but also in relation to A post responsibility and B post responsibility, although there is a more equitable shake-out of the B posts but very often these are the menial posts.  It is important that we enshrine in the Bill the exact words that one of the places go to a woman.  This was one of the principles we sought to enshrine in our Bill last year.  It sought to amend the Vocational Education Act, 1930, in order to give two parents and two teachers guaranteed places on vocational education committees.  We inserted that specific clause and it is important that it be inserted here.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to go the full hog in relation to the participation of women by right and by guarantee on the governing bodies.  I would also ask that the terminology be changed.  Instead of using the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; I suggest we insert instead the word &ldquo;elected&rdquo; to enshrine the democratic principle of electing members of the academic council to the governing body, student members, etc. This is the very principle of democracy and it is important that it be enshrined in the legislation.  The word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; should be deleted and the Minister <Col N="1496" /> should accept the reasoned amendments put forward by the Opposition on the need to insert the word &ldquo;elected&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the change being proposed by the Minister whereby the chairperson of the governing body is now to be appointed by the Minister.  A question we should address ourselves to in this House is whether anybody is seriously suggesting from the Government's side, that if it comes to nominating the chairperson and the political affiliation of particular members of the board are the same as the Government that the Government will not appoint one of their own supporters.  This is a reprehensible development &mdash; it is a movement away from democracy.  There is a democratic basis for the putting in place of the governing body but here we are bringing the key position of the members of the governing body into the area of political patronage.  In educational terms that is a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>In my view no Minister will appoint somebody of a different political persuasion. We can make all the protestations we like but the reality of appointments by Ministers in this country has always been that they were politically influenced.  We are taking democracy away and we are placing the appointment of the chairperson of a governing body in the area of political patronage.  I would ask the Minister to seriously reconsider what he is proposing here.  If the reason somebody is appointed to a position is that the person has a particular political allegiance and not because of his other capabilities and skills, then we are doing a grave disservice to this sector of education which has been nursed and brought to its splendid condition by vocational education committees.  We are going backwards rather than forwards. A Government who make great play of subsidiarity in the context of the Maastricht Treaty are now moving a democratic appointment from the local scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, who comes from the same region as the Minister, showed a great deal of commonsense in terms of <Col N="1497" /> his amendments in relation to the composition of the governing body.  It was based on a political career which had come from the grassroots of local government in his own area.  He understood the importance of local democracy and saw that the best road to pursue was for the governing body to elect their own chairman.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education is not present and I do not like talking about people who are not present.  In anything I have seen to date from the Minister there is no particular vision of education, but instead an accountancy approach, based on unit cost but not based on what education is all about.  I say this in all sincerity.  I believe this Bill will do enormous damage in the years to come to areas outside of Dublin, areas whose only third level provision comes from these colleges.  To put the appointment of the chairman of the board of management into the political arena, in a bald way which is open to abuse and patronage, is unbelievable.  The Minister has said he is following the usual practice in similar institutions &mdash; there are no similar institutions. These institutions have been developed from a local democratic base.</P>
    <P>Nobody so far has mentioned the people, with and without political affiliations, who were committed to this concept. I can recall people promoting this concept back in the sixties, talking about developing the food industry and providing people with the skills to participate in this type of industry.  With these amendments we are losing sight of the organic growth of these colleges and of the fact that these colleges reflect, to a very large degree, the demands of an area.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a matter I raised earlier in relation to which the Minister gave a disappointing response.  I refer to the deletion of a place for one person nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Let us examine what the role of such persons has been on the boards of management of the regional colleges. They reported back regularly to trades councils which consist of delegates from the affiliated unions throughout an area. <Col N="1498" /> There are areas that are bound by confidentiality, but general information about what the colleges are seeking to achieve, how they are seeking to expand and to better serve the students in a particular region, is fed back on a monthly basis through the trades councils so that the representatives of affiliated unions are aware of what is happening.  In addition, information about second chance education and courses designed to enhance the qualifications of people already at work is passed on to trades councils and thence to the affiliated unions.</P>
    <P>In my area I have seen the very positive input of trades councils.  For example, Waterford Council of Trade Unions played a big part in development of Waterford Airport.  I mentioned the sports complex, and another project is the kidney care unit at the regional hospital for which a great deal of the funding was generated with the active cooperation of the trade union movement at all levels.</P>
    <P>The Government tend to see trade unions as a nuisance to be placated, to be involved in agreements and kept on side.  They are losing sight of the positive role played by trade unions throughout the country through trades councils. There are many areas where trade unions play an important role and which do not get much recognition in the local or national arena.  I refer to developing services for and ensuring that buildings are made accessible to the disabled.  This, I know, relates to an area other than education but it underscores the point I am making.</P>
    <P>It would be a retrograde step to abolish the place for a nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  If this place is not allowed to remain as a matter of right, the Department may live to regret it.  It is stupid to abolish it and whoever is responsible for this idea must have no comprehension of what these colleges are about.  Instead of keeping the nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the board as of right, the Minister has now decided to bring the appointment of the chairperson of the board of management <Col N="1499" /> directly into the area of political patronage.  On balancing one against the other one can see where the Government are going.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at the three members of the staff who are to be nominated to the governing body.  Two members of the academic staff and one member of the non-academic staff are to be nominated. This is in a mind-boggling concept.  If someone is representing a group, that person should be elected by that group? How can that person be nominated by the group if he is not elected by the group?  There seems to be a subtle plan here; when a chairperson is appointed under the political patronage system that chairperson can then nominate two academics and a members of the staff whom he considers politically &ldquo;safe&rdquo;.  It is the movement away from democracy and towards political patronage and centralisation that is worrying.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about unnecessary duplication.  This is to lose sight of the role of vocational education committees. There is an organic growth between second level and third level institutions. This is an area that the vocational education committees have developed throughout the country since the 1930 Act.  We are forgetting services like literacy courses for people who cannot read or write.  It is the vocational education sector that provides services for such people.  The vocational education committees also cater for second chance education and the development of particular talents both at second and third level. The grasp and vision of the vocational education committees is something the Minister and Government are kicking into some educational dustbin to the detriment of the people of Ireland.  Their services will be a loss to the children of Ireland and to many adults who, for whatever reason, did not succeed in getting the education they needed.</P>
    <P>We now come to the matter of gender equity.  Having four daughters, I suppose I have a vested interest in this, there is no reason why there should not be equal representation of men and women on <Col N="1500" /> boards of management and on the staff. I would add the caveat that people should not be promoted merely because they are men or women; they must be promoted on ability.  Having said that, no one could disagree that the proportion of women in important positions in education is disgracefully low.  I agree with other speakers that what the Minister has included here is aspirational and vague and does not mean much at the end of the day.  If we are to move rapidly towards gender equity we must do something more substantial than is done in this legislation and there must be active discrimination in favour of women.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to that.  If he is not accepting the amendments moved by Deputies Ahearn and Higgins I hope he will, on Report Stage, move a suitable amendment which will take our views on board.</P>
    <P>Examination of the amendments shows up the deletion of the role of the vocational education committees.  My examination of the amendments spelt out one thing clearly, that the present Minister is the plaything of the Department. Essentially, this is the Bill that the Department wanted in the first place. The good sense of the previous Ministers for Education, Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Davern, prevented the Department from getting the Bill it wanted. The amendments demonstrate the thinking inside the Department.  This Bill is not based on education, on regional development or on balanced development throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The famous guidelines in relation to regional technical colleges provide for only 10 per cent of students pursuing degree courses.  Admittedly, while some colleges have no provision for degree courses, a good number of degree courses are provided by other colleges.  We should be talking in terms of growth.  The industry of any region of the country that will take its place in the new Europe will have to be able to compete within a much more rigid system in which only the best will survive.  At the very beginning, Ireland has the disadvantages of being an island nation and the only nation in the <Col N="1501" /> Community that does not have a land link with Europe.  The provision of education in rural Ireland, therefore, needs to be expanded rapidly.  Statistical figures illustrate that graduates from a college tend to stay in the immediate area of that college.  The Bill is a method of writing in tablets of stone that our achievers in the second level education system will, by and large, be directed towards Dublin and the other university cities.  In that way the legislation will add to the drain of people of ability from those parts of Ireland that do not have a university. That measure gives the lie to a Government that is in the process of selling the Maastricht Treaty on the lines of subsidiarity. This Bill is all about centralisation.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Committee dealt with section 5.  Many of us were concerned about some of the provisions contained in that section because of a perceived centralisation of authority in Marlborough Street.  The Minister amended those provisions in a way that made them less objectionable, and I complimented him on that.  However, the Bill is much more complex than it appears on the face of it.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the most important section to be dealt with in Committee so far; the section relating to the way in which the governing body of the college will be composed, the way in which the chairperson will be elected and which outside agencies and organisations are to be represented on the board.  The Government have decided to kick out the representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  There is much talk of the social partners but what does that measure have to do with social partners? It is a complete negation of that concept.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a Department that does not have sufficient information about the way in which the whole system works, a Department that look to the financial elements rather than to the educational elements, have brought in this amending legislation.  The amendments that have been made have given rise to a new Bill &mdash; this is not the Bill introduced by Minister O'Rourke and improved upon by Deputy <Col N="1502" /> Davern.  The present Minister for Education is very closely following the kind of education philosophy that developed in Margaret Thatcher's Britain to the detriment of Britain.  The Bill is going down the very same road in that the new amendments made to it do not comprehend the organic nature of education in areas outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>If the university at Maynooth is included, Dublin effectively has four universities. Thirty per cent of the students at the Dublin Institute of Technology are pursuing degree courses.  I welcome and support that development; every educational development in the capital or elsewhere has to be welcomed.  However, the trade-off to the rest of the country, other than the cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway, which have universities, is a ten per cent degree provision.  By and large, someone wanting to pursue a degree course has to leave his or her own local area; resources leave the local area and, worse still, that individual will probably stay away from the local area forever because of the recognised pattern of people staying in areas near the college from which they graduate.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to seriously reconsider the method proposed in the Bill for the appointment of the chairperson of the board of management.  The method proposed is open to political abuse, something that should be taken out of any Bill that seeks to improve any sector of education.  I shall oppose the measure by way of calling for a vote when the time comes if the Minister does not respond to my plea.</P>
    <P>Equally, the stupid &mdash; and I use that word advisedly &mdash; decision to remove the nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions from an automatic place on the board is a retrograde step.  I do not know whether that decision is based on some kind of ideological vindictiveness. Deputy Garland and I have tabled an amendment seeking that a nominee from the other side of industry, the FIE side, also have an automatic place on the board of the new governing body.  Those of us who know the system recognise that there are people in industry who have made a <Col N="1503" /> very great and a continuing contribution to this sector of education.  It is absolutely vital that both the organised labour sector, through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and the FIE nominee have an automatic place on the board of management.</P>
    <P>All the amendments that seek to reduce the role of vocational education committees, which is already reduced to virtually nothing, are wrong.  If the links with vocational education committees are not allowed to remain that will be to the total detriment of the system.  At the end of the day, decisions made outside the House will have a great bearing on this Bill.  I have already mentioned that the maintenance ESF grants are to be means tested from September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take your direction on that matter, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. My point is that the policies being pursued by the Government will result in a decrease in the number of students attending regional technical colleges and a downgrading of that sector of education. By way of amendments that have been tabled, the Government want to remove the role of vocational education committees as a buffer between the Department and the colleges.  This is the real thinking behind the new amendments. The committed locally elected body, since the inception of the regional colleges, have nurtured and developed the colleges but, effectively, the Department of Education want to run down this sector and to direct the achiever type students in the system towards the university sector on a centralised basis, very much to the detriment of the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>In calling Deputy Browne, I suggest that, as far as possible he confines his comments to the amendment and, in doing that, he can speak to his heart's content.  I should like to advise the House that we can also, to our heart's content, criticise the Minister.

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I will make two comments on your remarks, I am a firm believer in the saying that brevity is the soul of wit; I have never been reprimanded for making long speeches in this House and today will not be an exception.  I also wish the Minister well in recovering from his appendicitis operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time &ldquo;decentralisation&rdquo; has been the flavour of the month.  Departments have been transferred down the country and I am in favour of that policy. I assure the Minister of State that as a fellow constituency TD, I will back him all the way in transferring a Department to Carlow, as he has successfully done in relation to Kilkenny.  Therefore, I do not criticise the idea of decentralisation. However, in this instance where the election of a chairman has now been handed back to the Minister it looks as if decentralisation has gone out the window, in regard to this aspect at least.  It leads to the question of whether there will be political patronage.  I accept the right of the Minister to nominate somebody who can stand on his or her merits because of academic, business or industrial achievements and who would be a shining light in the governing body of the regional colleges.  However, I am afraid that, in picking a chairman, his or her political beliefs might weigh very heavily with the Minister, which would be a disaster.  I admire the work of the regional colleges throughout the country, they have done a great deal for education and employment as a result of their practical educational <Col N="1505" /> system.  I firmly believe that they should be recognised as third level education centres.</P>
    <P>The only argument against the role of vocational education committees who have done so much work for second level and vocational education down through the years is that if they are to be recognised as third level colleges they cannot be linked with second level administrations. That is not taking from the tremendous work which so many vocational education committees &mdash; and members of vocational education committees &mdash; have done over the years.  I agree with previous speakers who said that to fail to accept the recommendations of the vocational education committees is throwing them to the wolves.  The Minister does not have to accept recommendations made by the vocational education committees but they should at least have the right to make them.  The Minister may pick the best person for the role of chairperson of the governing bodies but it will be very difficult for highly qualified people, who may have a particular political allegiance, to face the wrath of the public if their political views are well known.  People are entitled to hold political views and if they did not many of us would not have been elected to this House; we must have people who support us.  However, the political beliefs of a ministerial appointment will always be questioned.  I regret that the chairman will be appointed directly by the Minister and I hope, in making such appointments, that the Minister of the day will be able to justify them on qualifications, performance and past experience.</P>
    <P>The regional colleges will only get the status they deserve if they can award degrees right across the board; they cannot be third level colleges without having full academic standards.  I am in favour of third level status being granted and I said yesterday that, if they were recognised as institutes of technology, they would attract standard recognition inside and outside the country, which would make a big difference to them.</P>
    <P>I also agree that ICTU should be on <Col N="1506" /> this governing body because they represent many people who have difficulties in relation to third level grants.  The trade unions should play a leading role in the inequity in relation to third level grants and I very much regret that their representative is not included.  No one else represents a wider view of the practicalities and difficulties facing the public. Somebody has obviously lost the run of themselves in regard to the English language, about being nominated and elected to the governing body.  In a democracy people will have to be nominated and then elected by their peers or colleagues.  It would be more sensible to have the word &ldquo;elected&rdquo; inserted.  I cannot understand why the word &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; replaced it.</P>

      <P>Most of the points have been made by other speakers.  It has been pointed out that the former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, increased the membership to 22 but the present Minister has reduced it to 16 members.  I suppose we should be grateful that he increased the academic staff representation to two, the same applies to the student representation.  However, he did not agree to have the simple word &ldquo;elected&rdquo; inserted instead of &ldquo;nominated&rdquo;. There is a difficulty in this regard; it might appear from the Bill that persons may be elected because it states, &ldquo;shall be nominated by that staff in accordance with regulations made by the governing body&rdquo;.  The governing body could make regulations saying that the person could be elected.  However they may also make other regulations with regard to the appointment of members of the academic staff which may not be acceptable to the academic staff who would prefer an election. Similarly, in relation to the student body, the Bill states &ldquo;one person, being a registered student of the college, shall be nominated by the registered students in accordance with regulations made by the governing body&rdquo;.  Again, we do not know what regulations a governing body will make and these may well be unacceptable to the students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision could be the source of <Col N="1507" /> controversy because persons will be nominated in accordance with regulations made by the governing body.  This will lead to the creation of a self-perpetuating governing bodies system. These will be able to decide on the regulations under which a member of the academic staff and a registered student will be nominated and appointed to the governing body.  This sounds crazy and is undemocratic.  I do not know whether it is appropriate to give powers to the chairperson, who will be appointed by the Minister, to decide on the system of selection, but the Minister of State should advert to the democratic procedure which is acceptable to all other bodies and allow the staff and students to elect their own representatives on to the governing body.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided that he will select the chairperson without interference or seeking recommendations from anybody.  Under the Bill as it stands, he has the power to appoint the chairman &ldquo;on the recommendation of the vocational education committee&rdquo;, in addition to the power to remove him. Incidentally given that the word &ldquo;chairman, is used in the Bill, there is little hope that Deputy Ahearn's amendment, the purpose of which is to provide for a woman chairperson, will be accepted.  It seems the Minister has decided to appoint a chairman.</P>
    <P>As I said, under the Bill as it stands, the Minister has the power to remove the chairman from office but only &ldquo;on the recommendation of the vocational education committee&rdquo;.  However it should be noted that the words &ldquo;on the recommendation of the vocational education committee&rdquo; are being removed wherever they appear in the Bill.  As a result the Bill will state that the chairman shall be appointed by, and may be removed from office by, the Minister.  No restrictions are being imposed, with the result that he will be able to appoint whoever he wishes.  He will also be able to remove that person from office whenever he wishes without seeking recommendations from anybody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> I wonder why the Minister wants to retain this power in relation to the functions of the colleges, from research to the conferring of degrees and the curricula. These are supposed to be third level institutions but the Minister is reducing them to the level of polytechnics.  Given the changes that are included in the Green Paper, the Department will have far more control over third level colleges than they do over the primary school system.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill a college's functions will be &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  Given that he will also be able to appoint the chairperson he will be able to maintain tight central control over each and every college and decide what they can do in a range of areas.  The purpose of this Bill is supposed to be to give the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology autonomy.  What it will do instead is remove the local input into the colleges and tie the colleges in every respect to the apron strings of the Minister.  Therefore the proposal to give the Minister the power to appoint the chairperson is the final straw because it will lead to tighter ministerial control.</P>
    <P>The proposal in relation to the person to be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions can only have been made on the basis of ideological hatred &mdash;&ldquo;why should the ICTU be mentioned in the Bill?  Throw them out for God's sake as we do no want them&rdquo;.  Under section 6 (4) (g) as it stands &mdash; I would like the Minister of State to read it for us &mdash; five persons shall be nominated by organisations which shall be representative of industry, agriculture, commerce, the professions and other interests as appropriate to the activities of the college. Therefore, given the reference to industry, agriculture and commerce, and the professions the employer organisations are going to be well represented.  What is the reason the Minister wants the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to have only one representative on the governing body?  It seems that he is adopting an ideological position which gives <Col N="1509" /> employers in the areas of industry and commerce a strong input.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to recall that, following the appointment of the Minister, Deputy McCartan said that at least the Minister would not be able to privatise anything, to which the Minister replied, &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo;.  In relation to the introduction in the Green Paper, it appears that he has some ideas in mind with regard to the primary sector and, possibly, the regional technical colleges.  He is going to retain strict control and is limiting the number of persons to be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to one.  Perhaps this is an indication of his future intentions for these colleges.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one other point in regard to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  What has the Minister in mind in relation to apprenticeships in the regional technical colleges?  Although apprenticeships are not mentioned in the Bill, the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, indicated that these would be retained wherever they exist.</P>
    <P>Presumably there is provision, in section 5 (1), in regard to the functions of the college, that is the last section with which we dealt, which says that the function of a college shall be to provide vocational and technical education and training.  I presume there is provision made for apprenticeships.  The present Minister has never mentioned apprenticeships.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he regards apprenticeship as playing any role whatever in the regional technical colleges, in the functions of the governing bodies or, indeed, of their chairpersons.  If the Minister envisages that apprenticeship will form part of the functions of some of the colleges, then surely a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should be on the governing bodies?  Does the Minister's removal of ICTU from having any contact with the RTCs mean that he will also remove them from all contact with apprenticeships?  I should like clarification of that point from the Minister. I should also like the Minister to read out the ministerial version of section 6 (4) (g).</P>

      <P>As far as I am aware, none of the regional technical colleges has ever managed to win an architectural award.  Certainly the RTCs built in the early seventies are distinguished by their physical similarity; if one has seen one, one has seen them all.  But there the similarity ends because each of the RTCs has managed to carve out for itself a distinction and uniqueness, indeed, a degree of regional responsiveness.  What is happening here is the beginning of the end of the unique regional character of the regional technical colleges.  We are now faced with a scenario in which, under the new regime, the governing bodies of the RTCs will be appointed by the Minister, albeit in some cases from nominees of particular constituencies.  For example, the chairperson of the regional technical college governing body will be appointed by the Minister and any replacements will be appointed by the Minister.  In addition, the governing body, in the exercise of their functions, will have to report to the Minister, will have to submit their programme to the Minister, have it approved by the Minister and have their budget approved by the Minister.  This country is full of people who work in State organisations, in local authorities, health boards, in some areas of the education service, who are absolutely frustrated that they cannot get on and do the job for which they were appointed.  There are all kinds of little details on which they must report back to the parent Department, seek permission, sanction and approval of this, that and the other from the parent Department. Clearly that is what is intended in the case of the regional technical colleges. Where the members of the governing bodies will be appointed by the Minister &mdash; such appointees owing their appointment to the Minister, with this high degree of reportage back to the Department of Education &mdash; in practice there will be a tendency for the regional technical colleges to become the same; harmonisation will be the order of the day. What will be lost will be the unique, regional character of the regional technical colleges because what will be missing <Col N="1511" /> will be the accountability and responsiveness to local needs through the vocational education committees.  I consider this to be a very regressive step for the regional technical colleges.  I predict that, in time to come &mdash; if this Bill is passed by the Oireachtas &mdash; it will be seen to have been very bad legislation indeed to have reversed the regional orientation and character of the regional technical colleges.</P>
      <P>It is highly significant that effectively we are proposing the end of regionalisation of the regional technical colleges, proposing a system of appointing governing bodies and of reportage which is highly centralised at the very time when, throughout Europe, emphasis is being placed on regionalisation, on allowing regions develop their momentum and areas.  Of course, it is also at variance with the high-minded sentiments set out in the introduction to the Green Paper which referred to devolution, decentralisation, autonomy and so on.  The whole idea of this educational umbilical cord between the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges and the Department of Education is completely at variance with the stated policy position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree also with the comments made in relation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I cannot understand why it is proposed to delete representation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions from the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges.  As I understand it, that is not a new idea, that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are represented on existing boards of the regional technical colleges. In most cases what happens is that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions appoint a nominee of the local trades council. Therefore, what is being done here is not simply deleting from the Bill something that is new but rather ending a practice that has been in existence for 20 years whereby the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been represented.  In most cases, Congress have appointed nominees of the local trades councils to the boards of regional technical colleges. <Col N="1512" /> That practice will be ended.  An entire segment of local opinion, that is the local opinion of organised labour in the locality, will be denied representation on the boards of the regional technical colleges. I cannot understand why this is being proposed.  It does not make any sense.  I should like to hear what the Minister's justification is for doing so. Certainly it is at variance with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which speaks in laudable terms of the involvement of the social partners, of the trade union movement, in a whole range of areas.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been notified of the Minister's intention to exclude them from the provisions of this Bill and what has been their attitude to that?  I cannot believe that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would agree with being excluded from the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges.  If the Minister has not already done so I would suggest that he should advise the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that it is his intention to exclude them from membership of the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges. Then let us ascertain what will be their response.  When it does become known to Congress that it is proposed to exclude them from membership of the governing bodies of the RTCs I predict the Minister will be coming back here, on Report Stage, or perhaps going into the Seanad, to have them included, because it would certainly be very much at variance with the proposals contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were they excluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla requested that I read out exactly what is contained in section 6 (4) (g).  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(g) five persons shall be nominated by such organisations as the Vocational Education Committee consider require representation having regard to the particular courses provided by the college excluding interests otherwise represented on the governing body.  Such organisations shall be representative <Col N="1513" /> of industry, agriculture, commerce, the professions and other interests as appropriate to the activities of the college.</P>
    <P>A number of points have been raised, some of which were dealt with earlier.</P>
    <P>First, I totally reject the suggestion of political favouritism advanced by Deputy O'Shea.  The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the broadest possible spectrum of talent will be taken into account in the political appointment to the post of chairperson.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea mentioned overall education policy and, in response, let me dwell on the key principles which are: devolution to school and institutional level to manage their own affairs; the major broadening of curriculum to enhance vocational education; providing equality of educational opportunity for all; promoting gender equity and developing teachers as key agents in educational change.  He also referred to the role of vocational education committees generally and the contribution the vocational education committees make to adult education and literacy programmes. I agree with the Deputy and I applaud the very fine contribution made by the vocational education committees in this area over the years.  There are no proposals in this Bill, or anywhere else, to take this role away from the vocational education committees, on the contrary this is an area for development and one I will encourage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea also expressed the fear that there would be changes in apprenticeship training arising from the Bill. Section 5 (1) provides for regional technical colleges to engage in technical education and training which specifically covers apprenticeships.  Again, I agree with his point on the drain from local communities to university towns.  Indeed, those who live in rural Ireland will agree with him.  At present the Higher Education Authority, the NCEA and the Department of Education are examining how best to put in place a comprehensive system of modularisation of courses and <Col N="1514" /> credit transfers.  This would greatly facilitate flexibility of study in different geographic locations and would facilitate the mobility of students across the entire sector.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies think that power is being centralised in the Minister and Marlborough Street was mentioned.  I wonder how Deputies can in all honesty say this is true.  The membership of the governing body, for example, comprises six vocational education committee nominees, representatives from five vocational education committee nominated organisations, two students and three staff, making a total of 16 and these appointments are determined locally, I do not think the Members' arguments stand up.</P>
    <P>Many Members also expressed their concern in relation to the nomination of staff to the governing body.  The reason nomination is mentioned is that some sections may wish to nominate rather than elect their representative, for example, the students may wish to nominate their Union of Students of Ireland representative.  However, if Members feel that should be changed I have no difficulty in doing so and substituting the words &ldquo;or preferably by election&rdquo; if Members agree.  I do not see any difficulty with making this change because it was not included for any sinister reason but only to facilitate groups which may wish to nominate their representative. However, if Deputies agree, we can change it.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees' involvement in the governing body has caused quite a degree of concern.  I must admit that the vocational education committees are very well represented on the governing body through their six nominees as well as the five persons nominated by organisations which the vocational education committee select, as provided for in section 6 (4) (g).  With regard to ministerial involvement, it was always intended that the Minister would make the appointments.  However, taking out of the recommendations of the vocational education committees does not make any great difference but it has caused a great <Col N="1515" /> deal of concern both inside and outside the House.  We will look at this between now and Report Stage and we may bring forward an amendment at that stage which may be acceptable to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an ICTU member also gave rise to a great deal of concern. There is a number of organisations currently represented on the management boards of regional technical colleges but staff and students are not represented as of right.  In the interest of ensuring the governing body is a workable unit, it is not proposed to include individual organisations. However, it would, of course, be open to the vocational education committees to nominate any such member under section 6 (4) (g).  Let me add there is a number of other bodies &mdash; Deputy O'Shea referred in particular to the FIE &mdash; who have expressed an interest in being represented on the governing body but perhaps it would be best to deal with this under subsection (4) (g).  If there were too many representatives on the governing body it would become unwieldy and for that reason the change was made.</P>
    <P>Before the Chair puts the question perhaps Members might like to respond to whether representatives should be nominated or elected to the governing body and, perhaps, we could first get agreement on that point.</P>

I would prefer if the representatives were elected but I have no objection if the Minister wants to give both options.</P>

I do not think that 22 representatives will make the governing body unwieldy. while I acknowledge the Minister did not move the ministerial amendment No. 42 to increase the number to 22, I will certainly move amendment No. 44 in the names of Deputies O'Shea, T.

      <P>The Minister is taking a different road from that taken by his predecessor.  The vocational education committees have done tremendous work in the establishment of regional technical colleges.  It is obvious that the Minister for Education has never been a member of a vocational education committee.  I suppose the Minister of State has had that experience. The heavy hand of the Minister is in evidence here.  This should not be allowed.  Our party have protested in the strongest way against this kick in the face being given to the vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to provide for the circumstance of a member of a governing body being absent from meetings for six consecutive months.

      <P>My amendment No. 76 is similar.  Its purpose is to ensure that the governing body is a working governing body.  Occasionally people are members of governing bodies for prestige purposes.  The amendment provides that if a member of a governing body is absent from all meetings of the body for a period <Col N="1531" /> of six months, unless the absence is due to illness or is approved by the governing body, he or she shall be disqualified at the expiry of such period from continuing to be a member of the governing body.

      <P>I have no difficulty whatsoever in accepting the comments made by other Members in this regard.  I believe that if a person is appointed to a governing body &mdash; or any committee or board for that matter &mdash; and then does not turn up to meetings for six months he or she obviously has no interest in the appointment.  However, I should have to make provision for the contingency of an appointee being ill or unable to attend meetings for some other reason.  I have no difficulty in accepting that a person should vacate his or her position on a governing body after an absence from meetings of six months unless there are special circumstances.</P>

      <P>There is a technical point that I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  Amendment No. 56a sought to insert the phrase &ldquo;of whom at least three shall be members of a local authority&rdquo;.  The amendment related to the six vocational education committee members who are to be nominated to the governing body of a regional technical college.  Subsequent sections of the Bill prevent Oireachtas Members or Members of the European Parliament from being members of a governing body.  If a vocational education committee <Col N="1532" /> opted for the least number of public representatives or, more correctly, if the local authority forming the vocational education committee opted for six members of the local authority and four of them were Members of the Oireachtas or MEPs, the quota of three who would be members of a local authority might not be filled.  You could have six members of a vocational education committee, four of whom could be Members of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament, leaving only two members who would qualify as public representatives in this situation.  It is just a technical point which occurred to me.</P>

      <P>We will not be voting against this section but I wish to comment on paragraph (g).  This refers to five persons being nominated by the vocational education committee and encompassing various interest groups such as industry, agriculture, commerce and so on.  In tandem with the provisions in section 5 in relation to research and development this is one of the most vital sections in the Bill.  In relation to fulfilling the role of the regional technical colleges as dynamic agencies liaising with industries, the research and development aspect of section 5, with the nomination of appropriate people from relevant industries and professions, is vitally important.  I am sure that the vocational education committees will bear this in mind in terms of choosing and nominating the personnel involved because too often in the past talented graduates left college without doing any research and this element has been underutilised in universities and colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to make our mark on the competitive European scene it is vital to have the ability and capacity to innovate, to initiate new processes and to increase our research and development facilities. That is where colleges can play a central and vital role.  Too often the non-indigenous industries, which were brought to this country at considerable cost to the taxpayers and the Industrial Development Authority, have been &ldquo;torso&rdquo; industries; their production facilities are <Col N="1533" /> in this country but their research and development &mdash; the feet and legs &mdash; are overseas.  That is why it is vital from the point of view of promoting industry within the region, and promoting the concept of the regional technical colleges as the catalyst of development within the region, to increase research and development. We must ensure that the people nominated have a proven track record within the community in relation to development, industry and economic input.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the nominations of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been deleted and that the Minister has taken full control of the appointment of the chairperson. However, I thank him for accepting a number of suggestions from this side of the House which he will introduce on Report Stage &mdash; one is allowing for election to the governing body by the staff and students and the other is reconsidering the point about recommendations by the vocational education committee.  This has been deleted in three or four different areas, one in subsection (3) in line 33, in subsection (4) it has also been deleted, in subsection (5), line 30, and again in the appointment of a chairperson in the Second Schedule.  Will the Minister clarify whether we will review this matter in all areas or in just one or two?</P>

I fully agree with Deputy Jim Higgins's remarks; and the spirit of the Bill bears this out because it has been emphasised that when appointments are made by the vocational education committees they should be relevant to the catchment area of the school involved.  If it is possible to strengthen that division we will do so on Report Stage.</P>

The Bill as published states that in performing its functions a governing body shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and of preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims. In the context of the Irish language, this provision is rather weak and does not put sufficient emphasis on the Irish language. It merely states that &ldquo;a governing body shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language&rdquo;; we bear many things constantly in mind but they do not necessarily motivate us to do anything.  Amendment No. 81 seeks to strengthen that provision while the words that I am seeking to have substituted, by words which have been recommended by the universities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The figures for this year are disappointing and a continuation of this trend would not be in the best interests of the country.  However, I am confident that the underlying industrial relations climate is relatively good and the recent disputes should be seen as a temporary setback rather than an indication of any long term trend.  I am hopeful that once the An Post dispute has been settled industrial relations can return to a more even and normal keel.</P>
    <P>It is important that the consensus-based approach adopted under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> should be maintained.  That approach has formed the cornerstone of <Col N="1538" /> our economic and social policy since 1987 and it is vital for the well-being of our economy that this approach be continued and built upon.  I am confident that both sides of industry recognise this and will continue to strive for industrial peace thus playing an essential part in the economic and social progress of our country.</P>
    <P>Many of the disputes we have witnessed recently have centred on the need for major organisational and structural change in both the public and private sectors of the economy.  This process of change is inevitable as we face the challenges of increasing competition in the European and global marketplace.  While I appreciate fully that adaptation to change can be difficult and challenging for all concerned, there is, by and large, a willingness to negotiate and agree the necessary changes without resort to industrial action.  In this context, I should point out that most disputes are resolved satisfactorily without disruption.  Last year, for example, 85 per cent of the disputes referred to the Labour Relations Commission for conciliation were settled. Countless more disputes were resolved without reference to third parties. I would encourage parties to take on this responsibility by working out their differences through meaningful negotiations. Where this does not prove possible, the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are available to provide expert and professional assistance.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that our system of industrial relations is a voluntary one whereby it is generally a matter for the parties concerned to reach agreement on how a given dispute will be settled.  The State facilities this process by providing the framework and machinery for the conduct of industrial relations and the resolution of disputes.  As Minister for Labour, I am satisfied that the existing machinery is more than adequate to deal with disputes and this had been borne out by the role played by the Labour Court and Labour Relations Commission in the disputes in the associated banks, An Post and RTE.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the existence of any <Col N="1539" /> plan to curb the influence of trade unions in Ireland.  As far as the Government are concerned, trade unions have played and continue to play an important role in the economic and social life of the country as is evidenced by their participation in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The Government would wish to see a continuation of this partnership approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics given by the Minister are the source of great concern and alarm, given that the number of days lost in the period January to April this year is five times greater than the figure for the corresponding period last year.  Furthermore, in respect of the same period in 1990, although the number of strikes was greater the number of days lost amounted to only one third of the figure for the corresponding period this year.  While the Minister may be satisfied that the existing machinery under the aegis of his Department is adequate to deal with strikes, I have to pose the question whether they are resolving them quickly enough.  Given that a greater number of days have been lost, it is clear that it is taking longer and longer to settle disputes.  Surely this matter should be investigated.</P>
      <P>May I also ask the Minister if he would agree that the problem of casualisation of work underlies the strikes which have taken place this year?  It is easy to provide casual labour at times of high unemployment. Does the Minister intend to carry out an investigation into this trend, because he would have to agree it has caused the strikes that are taking place at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my initial reply, it is important to put the matter in context in comparing the figures for the last few months with the figures for the corresponding period in previous years, in particular the past two years, the figures for which are the best on record.  It should be borne in mind in relation to the period under review, January to April <Col N="1540" /> 1992, that the banks dispute accounted for 134,200 days lost or 71 per cent of the total while the strike in RTE accounted for 30,000 days lost or 16 per cent of the total.  Taken together, they account for 87 per cent of the total number of days lost in the period under review.  As I said in my initial reply, both disputes centred on the need for major organisational and structural changes which have to take place if operations are to meet the competitive challenges that have to be faced in areas of the private and public sectors where a semi-monopoly situation exists.</P>
      <P>It is important that I should point out also that the partnership approach adopted under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, both of which were negotiated since our return to office in 1987, has formed the cornerstone in seeking stability in the area of industrial relations which is vital for the economy in terms of our ability to maintain existing jobs and to attract outside investment to provide more jobs in the economy.  It is wrong to send out the signal that the figures should be viewed with alarm &mdash; the expression used by Deputy Ahearn. Rather we should regard them as certain exceptional cases which arose coincidentally and simultaneously but which, it must be borne in mind, were dealt with adequately, professionally, with great expertise and competence by the industrial relations machinery.  Indeed, great credit is due to the Labour Relations Commission, who have just completed their first year of operations and are about to present me with an annual report showing the outstanding conciliation work they have done.  In relation to the number of man days lost, that is dependent on the employments in dispute which, in turn, dictate the number of man days lost.  Obviously, the numbers involved will constitute the multiplier effect in terms of calculating the man days lost in any given area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1970 there were more than one million man days lost; in 1979 there were 1,465,000 man days lost whereas last year the figure was just 82,000.  Therefore, the House will note an exceptional improvement <Col N="1541" /> related to the responsible approach adopted by the social partners, in particular the trade union movement, who must be given great credit for the manner in which they sought implementation of the programmes we had agreed.  Second, it is a compliment also to expert management in many of these areas, where communication is adequate to ensure that we do not get into dispute circumstances. Finally, there was the outstanding work done by our industrial relations machinery on the part of both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court who are the independent arbiters in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a period of comparative industrial peace, would the Minister agree that we have now reverted to the 1979-type figures and circumstances? Bearing in mind that there is a similarity between what happened in 1979 and what has happened this year to date &mdash; when once again there was a postal strike &mdash; and while the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> did afford workers some security in the past, there appears to be a lack of faith now in those agreements, inasmuch as there has been slippage from their provisions with an attendant increase in the number of man days lost.  While not for a moment criticising the role played by the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission would the Minister agree that recourse to them seems to be regarded as a last resort?  Could we not pre-empt many such disputes by using a little common sense?  Would the Minister agree that it would appear now that everybody is back in their trenches which, in turn, means that in the past 12 months we have reverted to the position that obtained some ten years ago because of the hardening of attitudes on both sides, but particularly on the part of the Government?  I respectfully suggest that the intervention of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications in the postal strike on one side did not help in any way in resolving that dispute. Would the Minister agree that, whenever <Col N="1542" /> a dispute arises, it is absolutely essential that the Government remain at arms length, at least not take sides?  If the relevant Minister must intervene, then he or she must be seen to be an independent arbiter rather than coming down in favour of one side.</P>

      <P>In an effort to respond to the many issues raised by Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan I should say that we have not gone back ten years in industrial relations.  While that may be a sincerely held view, it is wrong to give that impression since neither statistical evidence nor reality on the ground so suggests.  What has happened is that specific high profile disputes, such as those we experienced recently, were the reason we had these figures in the first quarter. The fact that 88 per cent of the total man days lost in the first quarter related to those two specific disputes demonstrates that in the overall broad range of industrial relations in all sectors of our economy we have an outstanding record which we must maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communication's involvement in the An Post dispute, first, it was unfortunate that personalities became a factor.  Indeed, in any dispute if there is involvement of particular personalities on the management or union side, it is not helpful and is a very poor principle on which to pursue any claim.  It does not advance the issue one way or the other.  In relation to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, I respectfully point out that she was simply intimating &mdash; I do not want to rake over old coals now that we are heading for a resolution of this dispute &mdash; on behalf of the Government, the reality of the position, agreed by her predecessor in September 1991 in correspondence in relation to the matter under dispute.  Indeed, she was saying on behalf of the taxpayer, whom we represent, <Col N="1543" /> that it is necessary that these problems in An Post be resolved internally. I am glad that both sides, through the Labour Relations Commission, are now arranging for that to be done, and, hopefully, the dispute will finally be resolved.  I do not see any point in raking over old coals at this stage.</P>

      <P>The point of the reply was to suggest that there are significant numbers already participating.  I might add that at an informal Council meeting of EC Social Affairs Ministers in Lisbon recently a discussion took place on vocational training.  Indeed, there is a great commitment at EC level to increase funding for that purpose and the tranche of Structural Funds from 1993 to 1997 so indicates.  For example, 40 per cent of Structural Funding emanates from the European Social Fund, under the aegis of my Department.  As an indication of the increased funding in this, and other related areas, I should say that in 1989 total funding from ESF through my Department was £137 million whereas this year it is £371 million.</P>

We are aware, through the Culliton report, that the activities of FÁS are being examined and geared to meet the recommendations of the task force on employment.

      <P>Is the Minister still happy with the fact that apprentices have to find their own sponsors?  I taught in a vocational school where a great many students wished to undertake apprenticeships. There was a vast inequality between those who had the potential to be excellent apprentices but could not find an employer to sponsor them and those who were taken on as apprentices.  Has the Minister any plan to rid us of that inequality, because apprenticeship opportunities should be available to studnets irrespective of whether they themselves can get a sponsor?  I believe it is not good enough and totally inequitable that only those who know someone who will sponsor them can be taken on as an apprentice.</P>

      <P>At present the breakdown of the apprenticeship system is that 80 per cent is employer sponsored and 20 per cent FÁS sponsored, and at the end of April there were 1,837 people in apprenticeships of which 1,467 were sponsored by employers.  It is important to realise that an apprenticeship involves a certain level of on-the-job training and therefore the involvement of employers, both in terms of the recruitment of apprentices and the standards they will achieve during the apprenticeship, is important.  That is why employers play such a primary role.  Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> it is proposed that responsibility for recruitment of apprentices will rest with employers, subject to agreed minimum educational standards.  What we are seeing is a reversal to the former time served basis with an addendum that if they reach a certain standard before their time is served they will be eligible for the certification process.</P>

      <P>First, may I say that I welcome any positive discrimination in favour of the disadvantaged or the handicapped. Would the Minister not agree that what is currently being considered is a reduction of the educational content in apprenticeship training and that, effectively, in the long term this will affect the future job prospects of apprentices in that they will have trained in a very narrow field unlike in the past when technical schools and regional technical colleges were involved in the training?  If the educational content is to be taken out of apprenticeship training we will reduce the apprentice's opportunity to make progress in later life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not our intention to take the educational requirement out of the apprenticeship system.

      <P>This is a point that we have to take on board.  Let me point out that we have a very narrow range of trades &mdash; the figure off the top of my head is somewhere in the region of 37 &mdash; under the apprenticeship system, whereas countries like Germany offer apprenticeships in over 300 trades.  It is my intention to broaden the base of the apprenticeship system.  However, in doing that we have to address the problem of funding.  I think employers generally will have to take on a greater role in terms of the funding of apprenticeship systems and will have to regard training as an investment rather than a cost, which is the unfortunate perception they have at present.</P>

      <P>When comparing Ireland with Germany the Minister is not exactly comparing like with like.  Germany has a huge economy and there are avenues open for apprenticeships in specialised areas.  The traditional apprenticeship training prepared a man for every aspect of work in a particular trade whereas in Germany an apprentice could train in a very narrow area of focus for a specific job.  That is fine in a big country like Germany but it would not be successful in this country.</P>

However, do the Government intend to increase the funding to the Health and Safety Authority in order to promote, encourage and advise employers and employees about the necessity for health and safety at work? Second, will the Minister tell me what supports his Department provide to employers, because it is far more profitable for employers to take measures to ensure the safety of their workers rather <Col N="1551" /> than pay large insurance premiums to compensate for the accidents that may occur.  What does the Minister intend to do in this regard?</P>

I am not aware of any problems in that regard.</P>
      <P>On the question of support for employers, I think employers realise that it is in their own interests to have the best possible health and safety standards at work.  The estimated direct and indirect cost of occupational accidents to Irish industry last year, taking into account increases in insurance premiums, etc., was approximately £300 million. Therefore the preventive measure envisaged by the Health and Safety Authority will go a long way towards reducing what is a significant cost to Irish industry at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of redundancies notified <Col N="1552" /> to my Department in January 1992 was 1,537, compared with 1,169 in January 1991.  The average monthly figure for notifications in the first four months of 1992 is 1,604, compared with an average of 1,390 per month for the year 1991.</P>
    <P>The total number of redundancies notified to my Department in the first four months of 1992 was 6,414, compared with 5,829 in the corresponding period in 1991.</P>
    <P>The total number of redundancies notified in the first four months of this year represents an increase of some 10 per cent on the figure for the corresponding period last year.  It should be noted, however, that this year's figures have been inflated to some extent by the large scale redundancies arising from the closure of the United Meat Packers plants throughout the country and the liquidation of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of redundancies reflects the rise in unemployment. We must all accept that the prospect of redundancy is an enormous problem for anyone who is employed. Is the Minister satisfied that redundancy payments are sufficient for people who suddenly lose their jobs?  Do his Department or the Government have any plans to introduce retraining schemes for people who are made redundant?  We should be doing everything we can to find long term employment for people who are suddenly made redundant.  If we do not take positive steps to provide retraining for people who are made redundant our unemployment level will continue to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to assess whether the myriad of training schemes being operated at present meet the needs of people who are unemployed and those who are seeking jobs.  It is my job as Minister for Labour to ensure that we consistently evaluate these schemes both from the point of retraining and their value for first time job seekers.  With regard to redundancies, we have developed a redundancy payments <Col N="1553" /> system and a statutory redundancy fund. These provide a safety net for employers and industries which go into liquidation. I am not saying this system is adequate or otherwise, but it provides a safety net. We compare reasonably favourably with our competitors in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it is a particular cause for concern that the rate of redundancy is, to use his figure, approximately 10 per cent higher than the figure for the corresponding months last year having regard to the general conviction that Irish industry is in good shape to face up to what we thought, at least until yesterday, would be Single Market conditions?  Is he putting anything in place to deal with this issue of job retention as distinct from job creation?  There is a necessity for us to look at why we are still shedding jobs at an accelerating rate as compared to the corresponding months last year.  Finally, may I ask him if his reference to the figures being inflated by UMP and the liquidation of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited means that his Department consider the former employees of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited to have been formally made redundant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's final question, that is a matter for the employer and the employees in that company.  With regard to the redundancy figures, I would point out that rationalisation has taken place in the meat processing industry.  For example, we are all well aware of the well publicised collapse of the Halal company in recent months. This is a factor which has to be taken into account when comparing the figures with those for the first four months of the previous year.  I agree that the retention of jobs is just as important as the creation of new jobs.  The Task Force on Employment have provided us with much interesting data which seem to suggest that our percentage of linkage in terms of supplying multinational companies here is only approximately 27 per cent. Therefore, there should be great room for improvement in the entire linkage <Col N="1554" /> programme.  While this programme has been promoted by the IDA for some years, it has not had the degree of success which the Deputy or I would expect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister adduced the liquidation of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited as a cause for the unexpectedly high figures.  When I asked him if he considered these employees to have been made redundant he said it was a matter for the employers and the unions.  Which is it?  Are the employees redundant, or is this issue still alive as between the employers and the union?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I am entitled to ask a supplementary question on this issue.  Would the Minister not agree that while the redundancy payments Act has served workers well we have now reached the stage where jobs are being shed under this legislation and profitable companies are making people <Col N="1555" /> redundant?  I accept it is only proper that a company which is no longer viable should be able to avail of the redundancy payments Act, but companies which are making a profit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a combination of reasons for the level of redundancy in our economy &mdash; for example, the global recession, continuing rationalisation, a loss of markets and a fall in demand, particularly in the computer and meat processing sectors.  It should be noted that the 1992 figure includes a considerable number of redundancies which were notified in the meat processing sector.  It is too early at this stage to predict with any confidence the likely figure for total notified redundancies in 1992.  It is on that basis that I gave my answer.</P>

      <P>A special labour market survey carried out by the EC Commission, the results of which were published in 1989, shows that the average number of hours worked by full time employees in industry in Ireland was 41 per week.  The corresponding average for <Col N="1556" /> the EC, excluding Denmark and Luxembourg, was 39 hours.  Average working hours in the ten countries covered varied from 37 in Belgium and the United Kingdom to 44 in Portugal.</P>
      <P>The Framework Agreement on Hours of Work negotiated under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provided for a reduction of working hours by one hour in cases where the normal working week is at or above 40 hours.  This agreement has generally been implemented throughout the economy and this should reduce the average for Ireland.  The question of a further reduction in working hours was discussed in the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but agreement was not reached on the issue.  The programme states that the ICTU have indicated that they will, in the event of negotiations for a further agreement on pay and conditions, be seeking a general reduction in working time in the context of international developments and the economic and social situation in Ireland.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> May I ask the Minister how the average is arrived at?  If I may digress slightly for a moment the average class size in Ireland is deduced by dividing the number of teachers into the number of pupils.  As there are some teachers with no classes and there are one-teachers schools, the average is not a realistic figure.  I would like to know how the average is arrived at and, second, will we do as is normal, that is, follow the European average?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House his disposition in this matter? Does he acknowledge that to shorten the length of the working week on average can contribute to job creation?  Is it his disposition to exhort the social partners negotiating on this matter to reach agreement <Col N="1557" /> on some minimal shortening of the working week in Ireland, having regard to the fact that we are still towards the top of the range?  This was one weakness I highlighted at the time of the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>In spite of the fact that we have the highest unemployment rate in the EC, the Minister has admitted that at 41 hours our average working week, including overtime, is in excess of the EC average.  Would the Minister comment on a statement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 30 April that Ireland is one of the two countries who oppose a 48 hour week for the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. The Deputy is referring to the EC directive on reorganisation of working time.  The Council will meet on that matter on 24 June.  Traditionally we have different working practices.  There is a need for flexibility in relation to that directive for practical reasons and for reasons of maintaining our competitive position.  There is no ideological problem in relation to this matter.  The directive is being made under the framework of the health and safety directive for the protection of workers in the workplace. We are in a negotiating position in relation to that whole matter.  It is wrong to say that we oppose the 48 hour average working week.  We are negotiating the reference period over which that average will be taken, and we are not alone in that.  There are many countries who wish <Col N="1558" /> to bring flexibility to that directive so that it is a workable directive.  We do not want a directive that is not workable and that prejudices our ability to retain existing jobs and create new ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the Minister's comments on maintaining competitive advantage, what does the Minister consider are the competitive implications of the British refusal to adopt the Social Charter?  Does that put this country at a competitive disadvantage in the matter of working hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The reorganisation of working time comes under the framework of the health and safety directive to which all of the Twelve are committed. Should a decision be taken in relation to that directive it will relate to the Twelve, and Britain will not be excluded from the obligations under the directive.  It is proposed by the Portuguese Presidency that the matter will be finalised on 24 June next at the Council meeting of Social Affairs Ministers.  This is a pre-Maastricht directive that will be binding on all 12 member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's approach to providing help for persons looking for work abroad is based on FÁS, through their national network of offices, providing counsel and advice to intending emigrants and outlining the various options which are available.  FÁS have a statutory obligation to provide such services.  Policy guidelines have been issued to FÁS, based on the principles of discouragement of unplanned and unprepared emigration and the need for national policy to support EC policy on Intra-European mobility.</P>
      <P>The guidelines require FÁS to provide counselling and information services on the job situation and working conditions in other EC member states; the display of vacancy notices under the EC-sponsored SEDOC system; and the development of bilateral contacts between FÁS and the national employment services in the main destination countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS provide an information and advice service to their clients and also include modules about emigration issues in appropriate training courses.  In recent times FÁS have, under the aegis of the EC, embarked on the process of developing <Col N="1560" /> special links with the employment services of the Netherlands and Germany. In addition, in co-operation with the state employment service in Britain, FÁS have set up a transfrontier committee on which voluntary bodies are also represented.  Part of the remit of this EC-sponsored committee is to examine ways of improving pre-departure services.</P>
    <P>Because of the ready access to Britain most of the problems associated with unplanned emigration tend to occur there.  For that reason I consider the transfrontier committee to be particularly important.  Already, under the aegis of the committee, a special weeklong orientation programme is available in London for newly-arrived emigrants, especially those who did not adequately prepare themselves for emigration.  Similar projects are being explored for the Netherlands and Germany.  I would urge all persons intending to emigrate to consult FÁS in advance.  It is clear that better use of the services they provide would lead to a reduction in the problems encountered by emigrants.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the work of DÍON, the Advisory Committee on Emigrant Welfare Services, who are at present in the process of advising me on the annual payment of £500,000 in grants to non-statutory bodies assisting Irish emigrants in Britain.  DÍON are also assisting the non-statutory bodies to coordinate their services and clarify their aims.  Their articulation of the needs of the Irish community and the problems facing emigrants is a valuable service.</P>
    <P>I am keeping all these services under review in consultation with FÁS and DÍON.  It is my intention, as circumstances require, to make what adjustments as may be called for from time to time.  I would voice my intention to improve and develop these services, as resources permit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present apprenticeship system has not been suspended.  Following a decision of the Board of FÁS on 2 April 1992, the existing system is to continue in 1992. The new system agreed by the social partners as part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is currently <Col N="1563" /> being developed by FÁS and the social partners.  The new system will be introduced in 1993 and be fully operational in that year.</P>
    <P>The National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee, which is representative of employers, unions, FÁS and educational interests, was established by FÁS to advise on the implementation of the new apprenticeship system.  The committee first met in October 1991 and has been meeting since on a regular monthly basis.</P>
    <P>On the advice of the committee, FÁS have to date commissioned surveys of employers to establish the current range of tasks involved in various trades.  This will assist in the development of curricula. They have decided to engage experts nominated by the social partners, FÁS and the Department of Education to write the curriculum for 25 trades. They have approved new draft apprentice rules for the new system covering such matters as the introduction of standards-based approach.

Our problem is that we have a far higher percentage of small to medium sized enterprises and therefore the availability of resources for training is much more limited.

Employers are of the opinion that there is a need to serve one's time, apart from the educational qualifications a person might be involved in obtaining.  Consultation at every level between employers and the National Training Authority is vital for the success of the apprenticeships scheme.  It must have the support of employers if it is to be successful. They must have confidence in the curricula drafted.  For that reason there should be consultation at every level.  I have good grounds to hope and believe that the subcommittee under the chairmanship of Mr. Kevin Duffy of ICTU have come forward with the sort of curricula which will inspire confidence in the business community to take on more apprentices.</P>

      <P>As I explained in a detailed reply to Dáil Question No. 50 by Deputy Peter Barry on 30 April, the precise implications of our adherence to the new Protocol on Social Policy agreed in the context of the Treaty on European Union will depend on the nature and content of any particular measures which may be brought forward at the initiative of the European Commission.  In general, however, the Government acknowledges that there will be positive advantages for Irish workers from Ireland's adherence to the Protocol, which can be ensured only by approval of the new Treaty in the forthcoming referendum on 18 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out, however, that the Treaty on European Union leaves the existing social policy provisions of the Rome Treaty and the Single European <Col N="1566" /> Act unchanged.  Ireland will continue to take any necessary measures to comply with its obligations in relation to social policy measures adopted under those provisions.  Ireland, of course, also remains fully committed to the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights &mdash; the Social Charter, as it is widely known &mdash; as a basis for achieving a strong social dimension to complement the economic objective of completion of the Single Market.  The development of the Community's social policy in a progressive direction is wholly consistent with national social policy objectives as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

I do not blame the present Minister for that, but out history to date on the acceptance of the Social Charter has been outrageous.

The commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> mirror and predate some of the social policy provisions now in the Social Charter as a result of the Maastricht Treaty provisions. As a matter of self interest we want to minimise any potential negative economic impact that such proposals would have on us.  In terms of our commitment to the idea, we are in agreement with it and we see great advantages in the social cohesion aspects of the Treaty provisions because they will benefit economies on the periphery of Europe.</P>

As a Government we have a duty to take into account the consequences of the implementation of certain social policy provisions.  We use those as part of our negotiating stance to get the sort of concessions and flexibility from these directives which will make them workable.  There is no point in us having very high aspirational directives from the European Commission, approved by the Council of Ministers, if they do not work.  If we are to have any credibility in this area we must come forward with realistic proposals so that all 12 member states, with different traditional practices in this area, can put forward a common position with which everyone can live.</P>

      <P>Research into the comparison between net wages especially for lower paid jobs and the potential social welfare income of those likely to fill them has shown that such employment would not be financially attractive in some cases.  Chapter 7 of &ldquo;NESC: A Strategy for the Nineties&rdquo; contains information on the poverty trap.</P>

    <P>The family income supplement is a major Government initiative to make <Col N="1568" /> employment a more attractive option in such cases.</P>
    <P>The partnerships established under the area-based response to long term unemployment have also identified the relationship between pay, social welfare payments and FÁS allowances an an obstacle to many long term unemployed persons taking up employment training or other manpower opportunities which would assist them return to the workforce. In this regard, the Taoiseach announced on 30 April last in Tallaght a number of special measures to be taken in the 12 pilot areas aimed at helping the long term unemployed in these areas get back to work.  The measures, which will be operated through the partnerships in association with the appropriate Government Departments, focus on eliminating difficulties faced by people who are long term unemployed when the possibility of taking up either paid employment and/or training and development schemes present themselves.  In particular, long term unemployed people, approved by the partnerships, taking up paid employment or becoming self-employed will retain their existing secondary social welfare benefits, for example, Christmas bonus, fuel and butter allowances and so on for a period of 12 months.  In the case of those becoming self-employed, they will be paid an allowance for the 12 months equivalent to the Social Welfare payments to which they were entitled while on the live register.</P>

Does the Minister agree that the interaction of low pay, social welfare and tax should be focused on by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment? Does the Minister accept that a great many of the long term unemployed will go into low paid work and that it is inequitable and counter-productive that they should immediately forfeit their fuel vouchers, their health card and their Christmas bonus and be subject to higher rents and so on if they accept an offer of employment?

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Consideration of the incentive to take up employment when it becomes available could be the subject of an in-depth examination by the Oireachtas Committee.  The area-based response which is operating on a pilot basis is addressing the specific issue of the secondary social welfare benefits which the unemployed enjoy.  I also agree that the whole question of low pay must be addressed.  The Government, through taxation proposals in successive budgets, have sought to improve the lot of the low paid and have taken out of the tax net an increasing number of low income earners. The approach to taxation reform must be gradual but we would wish to pursue the matter more quickly if Exchequer resources permitted.  The long term unemployed like to keep secondary social welfare benefits but this is a matter of some grievance to the low paid who are not entitled to them and <Col N="1570" /> who look upon themselves as worse off in many cases than those on social welfare. There is a conflict which must be addressed fairly quickly.  I agree that there is an inclination on the part of the long term unemployed to accept jobs in low paid areas.  The training authority will have to address that problem and perhaps bring in a module-based training programme for the long term unemployed which would enable them to improve their skill levels so that they could move into the skilled rather than the semi-skilled sector.</P>

      <P>Pay is an important element in the price of labour and will obviously be affected by demand and supply factors.  Unemployment levels, therefore, affect pay but it is difficult to establish the exact relationship as many other factors are involved such as skill levels and the type of labour in demand. Low pay tends to be associated mainly with certain occupational categories, the characteristics of the individuals concerned and particular sectors of industry and services rather than with overall employment levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research on low pay suggests that the bulk of low paid full-time workers are in the categories of unskilled and semi-skilled <Col N="1572" /> manual workers, the lower grades in clerical and office employment and general indoor sales staff.  Age, length of service and work experience have a major influence on the level of earnings and the sectors referred to are normally associated with high levels of labour turnover. Research also suggests that there is a link between low pay and employment patterns, particularly part-time working, and that this in turn affects mainly women, school leavers and older workers.</P>
    <P>It is fair to suggest that high unemployment has some effect on pay levels of young people.  Increasing the level of job opportunities available is to the advantage of workers generally.  The creation of additional employment and the maintenance of an environment conducive to job creation remain important priority areas of Government policy.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not correct to allow the marketplace determine wages especially as surveys have shown it is the unskilled and semi-skilled who suffer from the low wage mentality?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a statutory minimum wage is often cited as a solution to the problem of low pay.  This tends to ignore the fact that the problem of low pay is much broader than industrial relations or the employment question. So far as the industrial relations aspect is concerned the Department of Labour consider that the best hope for progress in the area of low pay lies in our collective bargaining system operating in conjunction with the joint labour committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is precisely in the areas of greatest concentration of low pay and most vulnerable young workforce &mdash; often female &mdash; that the collective bargaining mechanism is least in evidence, that the majority of these workers tend not to be organised into trade unions hence the <Col N="1573" /> necessity for the measure suggested by Deputy T. Ahearn concerning the introduction of a statutory minimum wage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply I have given but I would say that a research project seeking to establish the effects of minimum wages in other countries has been carried out for the Department. The research indicated, on the basis of analysis of US and European data, that a minimum wage has a negative employment effect, that the impact is most severe on young workers and on those with low levels of education attainment. It also concludes that two categories of workers benefit from minimum wages: first, workers who retain their jobs and who would otherwise receive a wage below the minimum and, second, those workers on or above minimum wages whose wages increase as a result of the minimum wage.  Employment opportunities may also expand for the second type.  There is a need to ensure greater social equity and this was specifically recognised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  Both programmes were specifically weighted in favour of low paid workers.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> gives special consideration to such workers by allowing for minimum increases of up to £15 per week over the three years.  These minimum flat rate increases, when combined with significant improvements in the family income supplement and income tax deductions, will result in a substantial improvement in the position of the low paid.  This is a matter on which there is not universal agreement as to how to tackle it.  The joint labour committees have been active in some of the areas to which Deputy Rabbitte referred.  The need is to ensure their recommendations are implemented.  I have been seeking to increase the number of inspectors who would get out into the field to ensure these matters are being attended to.</P>

      <Col N="1597" /> That a sum not exceeding £6,388,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1992, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and a grant-in-aid.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £9,083,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1992, for salaries and expenses in connection with Forestry and for payment of certain grants.</P>
      <P>The 1992 Estimates demonstrate this Government's continued determination to resolve the problems of the public finances.  Hard decisions have again been taken in the context of framing the 1992 Estimates.  The net Energy and Forestry Estimates for 1992, of £6.4 and £9.1 million respectively, represent only a fraction of 1 per cent of the total 1992 Estimates for Public Services.  Net expenditure in my Department &mdash; Energy and Forestry &mdash; has been reduced by 41 per cent over the past four years.  This is a very credible achievement when one considers that the reduction has been brought about not by curtailing essential activity but by getting better value for money, maximising opportunities for securing non-Exchequer financing and encouraging private sector development.</P>
      <P>After the threat to the availability of oil supplies posed by the Gulf War in 1990 and 1991 had passed without any disruption materialising, energy markets reverted to comparative stability at moderate prices.  Nevertheless the lessons derived from that episode were carefully studied at Government and international levels and policies adapted to enhance security and multinational co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland's case the measures taken to <Col N="1598" /> increase oil stocks and emergency preparedness are retained and increased efforts put in place to improve the efficiency of oil refining and diversify further our energy supplies through integration of gas and electricity networks with those of neighbouring countries. Other major developments affecting energy markets which I will discuss later are: (a) the completion of the European Single Market in the energy sector; and (b) the impact on energy supplies and utilisation of measures to mitigate potential environmental damage through harmful emissions and climate change.</P>
    <P>I will turn first to questions relating to oil, which continues to be the mainstay of our and international energy systems. The issue of Whitegate refinery and my Department's continuing efforts to attract a suitable investor for modernisation of the facility is a major priority.  The House is already aware that discussions on the feasibility of a specific project have taken place.  The results of these discussions are under consideration by my Department, their advisers and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  A successful outcome depends on prospective partners achieving their objectives as well as my and the Government's being satisfied that a proposal is in our interest.  I have stressed also to the House that no hasty decisions will be made on the future of the refinery.</P>
    <P>My Department have succeeded in obtaining EC grant aid under the PERIFRA programme for refurbishment work at the Whiddy oil terminal as part of the operation for the input and storage of strategic stocks of crude there.  The total cost of the work is approximately £1.8 million and the EC have agreed to fund up to half of this amount.  This work will contribute towards an overall improvement to the facilities at the terminal, enhance safety of operation and will also assist us in our efforts to obtain investment for its commercial reactivation.</P>
    <P>The gas interconnector link to the UK is now being developed.  Progress is well advanced and the project is on target for completion in October 1993.  Final <Col N="1599" /> Government approval was given to the project in December last.  The total cost is expected to be around £290 million in current prices and the European Commission have agreed to provide 35 per cent of that cost.</P>
    <P>Another important element of BGE's capital programme this year is the westward extension of the gas grid from Skibbolmore, County Louth, to Mullagh in County Cavan to serve a number of specific industrial and commercial customers. The estimated cost of this project is approximately £11 million, almost 70 per cent of which will be provided by the European Commission in grant aid from its Special Border Areas Programme. Work is curently under way and should be completed by the autumn.</P>
    <P>Completion of these projects will enable natural gas to provide a more important role in an energy supply system and provide a more secure and environmentally friendly source of fuel.  In 1991 Bord Gáis surrendered £128 million out of its profits to the Exchequer by way of dividend payment.  This brings the company's total dividend payments to date to over £288 million.  This year the board is expected to contribute £25 million.</P>
    <P>The most significant landmark to report in the area of nuclear safety/radiological protection in Ireland has been the establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland on 1 April last, which has now replaced the Nuclear Energy Board.  The grant-in-aid for this body for 1992 is £970,000.  A sum of £190,000 is being provided in 1992 in respect of the national radiological emergency protection plan, the aim of which is to provide a co-ordinated response to radiological emergencies. The plan will be published by the end of the month.</P>
    <P>Turning to electricity, earlier this year the Government approved my proposal for a major review of the ESB future structure of Ireland's electricity industry. I think all sides of the House will agree that the ESB have served the country well in developing a reliable electricity system.  In the early stages of the development <Col N="1600" /> of the system considerations of economy of scale dictated that the ESB should operate as a monopoly.  The ESB are now operating in a quite different economic environment and the justification for a monopoly is less apparent. With the advent of the internal market and the movement towards Economic and Monetary Union the ESB will be increasingly exposed to international competition.  For this reason I saw a need to review the existing structures with a view to introducing competition into the electricity sector and increasing transparency of costs.</P>
    <P>The European Community have also presented proposals for greater competition in the electricity sector in the context of the completion of the internal market in 1993.  The review which I am undertaking will be an important element in formulating Ireland's position at discussions in Brussels on the draft electricity directive on common rules for the internal market.  I have recently appointed consultants to assist my Department in the review and I would hope to report to Government on the outcome of the review later this year.</P>
    <P>The area of hydrocarbons exploration and development is one to which I attach great importance.  The Ballycotton gas field was brought into production in July 1991 three months ahead of schedule and only two years after discovery.</P>
    <P>In April 1991 I announced that a frontier licensing round would be held in mid-1993 involving a large number of specified blocks in the largely unexplored Erris and Slyne Trough areas.  This is very challenging acreage but initial indications of interest have been good.</P>
    <P>On 3 December 1991 I concluded an exploration agreement with Marathon under which a total of seven exploration wells will be drilled.  The first of the wells will be drilled in 1992 and the programme will continue to 1996.  Bula Oil are also committed to drilling a well in the Celtic Sea this year.</P>
    <P>The year 1992 will be one of major significance for hydrocarbons exploration in offshore Ireland.  A regime of taxation measures specific to the petroleum <Col N="1601" /> exploration and development sector has been included in the Finance Act.  The exploration sector will therefore have an important measure of certainty regarding its financial treatment.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have been most anxious to ensure that Ireland's tax treatment of this sector will prove clearly competitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> other countries and will provide a stimulus to intensified exploration efforts off our coasts.  That view has been shared by the Government, as is evident by provision in the Act for the availability of a corporation tax rate of 25 per cent for early discoveries.  In order to place themselves in a position to qualify for the reduced tax rate it will be necessary for exploration companies to commence exploration drilling within the next few years.  The availability of a tax rate of 25 per cent makes Ireland the most competitive location in north-west Europe and a location that no company should overlook when deciding on exploration activity.</P>
    <P>Turning to Bord na Móna, in recent years the board and management have undertaken, with the co-operation of the work force, a major reorganisation and restructuring designed specifically to address the company's financial problems. While this process has proved successful in returning the company to profitability, there clearly remains much to be done if the level of indebtedness is to be reduced to manageable levels.  This is a primary task indicated to and accepted by the board.  Costs are under rigorous scrutiny and productivity measures in all sectors are being sought.</P>
    <P>A sum of £300,000 is being provided in the 1992 Estimates for energy conservation activities.  The Government continue to attach a high priority to energy conservation reflecting the fact that improvements in this area can save money for the individual consumer, improve the competitiveness of our economy and reduce the emission of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The development of renewable sources of energy has a role to play in the diversification of our energy supply base.  I am pleased to say that work has commenced <Col N="1602" /> on the construction of Ireland's first windfarm at Bellacorrick, County Mayo, and it is expected that this important project will be operational by the end of October.</P>
    <P>A major challenge now facing the energy sector is to continue to meet the energy needs of our industries and citizens in a way that will minimise harmful emissions into the environment.  My Department are co-operating closely with the Department of the Environment on policies and programmes which will bring this about.</P>
    <P>Turning to mineral exploration and development, we are on the threshold of exciting times in the minerals industry, with a high probability that two major lead-zinc projects are about to come onstream at Galmoy and Lisheen. Clearly, the issue of most concern for the future of the industry at present is that of environmental protection.  The Government, as evidenced by the setting up of the Environmental Protection Agency, are absolutely committed to the protection of the environment.  However, a balance must be struck if we are to realise the potential of the mining industry. It is essential that these controls be operated in a fair and consistent manner and not in a way which is seen as anti-development and anti-job creation.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the Forestry part of my portfolio.  Deputies will be aware of the Government's emphasis on forestry as a key national development activity.  It is an emphasis that is shared by the EC authorities, who have committed very substantial financial resources in recent years to the expansion of Ireland's afforestation programme.  Under the current EC Forestry Programmes Ireland will receive about £75 million from the EC. Without this very welcome funding, we would not have seen the rate of progress that has been made and I think it is a point that is very pertinent in the content of the choice that people will have to make on the Maastricht referendum later this month.</P>
    <P>The improved forestry grants which I announced earlier this year reflect the <Col N="1603" /> Government's and the EC's determination to ensure that there is no slackening of effort in the aim of increasing the area of forest cover in this country and anticipated the adoption by the Community of proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy, including an enhanced role for forestry.  At the moment only about 7 per cent of Ireland is coverd by forest &mdash; it is a long way behind the Community averge of almost 25 per cent.  My aim is that we should reach about 10 per cent cover by around the turn of the century.  The increased grants support this aim.</P>
    <P>Good progress continues to be made in narrowing the gap between this country and the Community at large.  Last year was another record-breaking year for planting.  Coillte planted over 12,000 hectares in 1991 and the private sector &mdash; predominantly farmers, I am pleased to report &mdash; planted over 11,400 hectares.</P>
    <P>Trading circumstances in the timber industry continue to be extremely difficult, but despite the fall in timber prices Coillte were still able to turn in a modest operating profit last year.  In the context of continuing pressure on Exchequer finances the equity provision to Coillte has reduced from £15 million in 1989 to £10 million this year.  Notwithstanding this substantial reduction over that period, I hope that Coillte will be able to repeat the 1991 planting performance in 1992.</P>
    <P>I am also hoping that private sector planting can scale new heights in 1992. The provision included under subhead C would permit the planting of over 12,000 hectares.  I believe that farmers particularly are increasingly coming around to the view that forestry can play a very important role in supplementing incomes.  In a Common Agricultural Policy reform context the importance of forestry to rural communities is identified and I intend to actively promote the advantages of forestry throughout the coming year.</P>
    <P>The planting figures undoubtedly attract most attention, but forestry is an integrated industry.  For that reason <Col N="1604" /> grants are also available under subhead C for harvesting and extraction machinery, nursery developments and various other innovatory studies and pilot projects that support better usage of timber.</P>
    <P>I have just mentioned the integrated nature of the timber industry.  Now that potential timber supplies are increasing rapidly, there is, in my view, an urgent need to take a strategic look at the way in which the whole industry can be developed to the maximum advantage in the years ahead and particularly to gear the industry towards export markets. Downstream development is obviously an area of particular interest.  The Government are committed to the development of an overall strategy for the timber industry in Ireland and I hope to see good progress being made in that regard in 1992.</P>
    <P>Forestry research is also increasingly important in the light of the expanding afforestation effort.  The increased provision under subhead D will allow Ireland to participate in the EC STRIDE research programme.  The health and protection of our forest crop are particular priorities and the funding under subhead D will enable research to continue on such areas as species diversification and tree improvement, forest protection, increased efficiency and environmental and social issues.</P>
    <P>Given the historic summit now taking place in Rio, it is appropriate that I should now focus on the environmental dimension of forestry.  Events in Rio are certainly heightening awareness of the role which forestry can and must play in reducing the threat of global warming. While tropical forests have received a lot of attention, it is not, of course, an issue for resolution by Governments in those countries alone.  All countries have a responsibility, and those in the developed world have a special responsibility to take a lead.  Ireland's expanding afforestation programme demonstrates in a very real sense our readiness to put our own house in order before asking others to do likewise.</P>
    <P>The role of forestry in the environment is taken fully into account in our forestry <Col N="1605" /> programme.  My Department have produced detailed guidelines on the impact of forestry on archaeology and fisheries and further guidelines on landscape considerations will be published shortly.  All relevant agencies involved in wildlife management, fishery development or preservation of national monuments or areas of scientific or landscape interest are consulted by my Department.  If those agencies feel that afforestation would be inappropriate in certain areas, their views are taken into account.  In addition, I have announced special attractive grants for the planting of broadleaf forests and for recreational forests, including urban forests, and for diversification of species in suitable locations.</P>
    <P>I wish to state clearly that environmental as well as economic considerations lie at the heart of forestry policy, leading to a balanced development which will enhance our countryside as well as providing much needed employment and development.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the many significant developments in all spheres of the energy area.  The gas interconnector link to the UK is well advanced and our oil stocks are in a healthier position than ever before.  A review of the future structure of the electricity industry in Ireland is under way and a major reorganisation is in progress in Bord na Móna, with a view to improving the company's financial position.</P>

      <P>A new exploration agreement with Marathon will result in the drilling of at least seven exploration wells, there is a high probability that two major lead/zinc projects are about to come onstream and Ireland's first wind farm should be operational by the end of October.  All of these developments are designed to enhance security of supply and reduce costs to the consumer, while at the same time taking into account the important environmental concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also outlined a number of aspects of forestry and the environment which show that it is an important consideration <Col N="1606" /> in the forestry programme.  I have referred to the great strides being made in planting levels and what it is hoped to achieve in 1992.</P>
    <P>For net Estimates of just over £6 million and £9 million for energy and forestry respectively, I consider that the Exchequer is getting very good value for money.  I commend this Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>We are glad to have the opportunity of even a mad canter through the area of energy.  This is the first time for almost 18 months that the House has had any lengthy debate on energy &mdash; if this debate could be called lengthy.  I was glad to have the opportunity to listen to the Minister, although I certainly do not share his sense of complacency and self-satisfaction at the state of the Department of Energy.  The Fine Gael Party will oppose these Estimates because of the complete failure of the Minister and the Government to take seriously the issue and opportunities of energy conservation.</P>
      <P>A year ago in the debate on the Finance Bill I spoke at length about energy, as did the Minister.  That was the most recent occasion on which the House had any extended debate on energy.  At that time I identified the area of energy conservation as one of serious concern.  It continues to be an issue of concern.  In the shadow of the Earth Summit, referred to by the Minister, and the challenge presented by global warming and the damage to the ozone layer, the Government's failure is inexcusable.  Energy conservation will certainly be given a much greater priority when there is in office a Fine Gael Minister for Energy.  In the Estimate the amount provided for energy conservation has been reduced from the extraordinarily low level of £500,000 to £312,000 &mdash; a decrease of 42 per cent at a time when increased investment should be made in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has told us on other <Col N="1607" /> occasions, he does not favour a stated and detailed policy for energy.  He considers that that would be inappropriate in a fast-changing scene.  The consequences of that decision are inevitable: a lack of direction, contradictions, cross-subsidies and ad-hockery.  Our four major State companies, Bord na Móna, Bord Gáis Éireann, INPC and the ESB, ought to be agents for an efficient energy sector. However, they have suffered from the lack of a coherent energy policy.  In the Minister's speeches he avoids all of those issues and touches on occasional developments in each area, some of his references being of minimalist nature and quite laughable because of their complete lack of any coherent direction or interconnection. I know that my colleague, Deputy Durkan, is particularly concerned about the Minister's half-page treatment of Bord na Móna and about the consequences for the area that he and so many other Deputies represent of Bord na Móna operating strictly and entirely on a commercial basis without any examination of what that means for a region virtually dependent on that industry.</P>
    <P>Ireland is still one of the most energy-intensive producers in Europe.  The rate of primary energy used per unit here is about 18 per cent higher than the average of the EC as a whole, although we are less industrialised than other members of the EC.  When I have raised that figure previously the Minister has suggested that a reason is that Ireland is a growing, developing economy.  That does not stand up to an examination and analysis of other economies that have managed to achieve substantial conservation of energy at times of great growth.  Japan, for example, is an island state with very poor fossil fuel availability.  After the oil shock of the seventies the Japanese adopted an energy demand reduction policy.  While the Japanese gross domestic product increased by 50 per cent, their energy demand actually declined. Therefore, the Japanese are able to sell their products more cheaply as well as doing less damage to their environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> The argument that there must inevitably be growth in energy consumption when the economy is at a stage of growth does not hold up and is one that we cannot defend and should not seek to use as an excuse for our wastage of energy. This has been said in the Earthwatch options for Ireland in the nineties.  I do not take all their analyses as gospel. However, anybody who looks at the graph on page eight of their report, which shows the growth in our primary energy requirements at a time when all our European partners have managed to reduce demand substantially, will realise that our demands are unacceptable and wasteful in a country which needs every penny it can save to provide employment. We are wasting energy and poisoning our atmosphere.  This is a priority for Fine Gael and I will continue to press the Minister for Energy at Question Time to give this matter adequate attention.</P>
    <P>Our policy on conservation has been intermittent and it has never been treated as a serious response to our high dependence on imports or as a real alternative to multimillion investment in new energy capacity.  I note that the Taoiseach is now concerned about this and has indicated that he will look very carefully at the application of the ESB for new energy capacity.  How does the Minister for Energy feel about the Taoiseach's intervention which was reported in the Sunday newspapers?  The Taoiseach's concern arose from the fact that the issue of conservation was being inadequately addressed. I share his concern and I welcome his interest.  However, I am sure the Minister for Energy does not welcome the intrusion, and perhaps he will tell us how he feels when we have an opportunity to ask questions later.</P>
    <P>The consequences of failure of conservation must also be seen in the context of a growing economy and a growing demand for energy in the light of the failure to bring in efficiency and conservation measures.  This means that the ESB will have to provide extra capacity and that they will have to increase prices, which have been held down, resulting in <Col N="1609" /> their coming into line with those of our European partners.  There has been energy efficiency in fits and starts in the industrial and public sectors.  The report to which I referred acknowledged that substantial progress has been made in the industrial area.  However, in the domestic area there has been very little progress. The Government have offered very little leadership in this area &mdash; there has been some input by EOLAS and the ESB have occasionally taken an interest.  However, energy efficiency in public buildings and enterprises still leaves a lot to be desired. Government pricing and tax policies have often directly frustrated conservation.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, in Government, would make a serious energy conservation programme a central plank of all energy policy.  This would include the restructuring of the Department of Energy.  The inadequate attention given to this area is highlighted by the fact that when you look at the Directory of State Services the conservation section is tucked in with the forestry section and the general office services in the Department of Energy. My view, and the view of the former Fine Gael spokesperson, is that there should be a separate commission in this area and that, at the minimum, there should be a separate section in the Department.  The Government would not get away with the inadequate funding of the section if it was given that kind of organised attention.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister believe that the current structures are adequate?  Does he believe it is sensible to expect the ESB &mdash; whose major job is to provide energy and to sell it &mdash; to be one of the major engines of conservation?  It has temporarily suited the ESB to be involved in conservation because it meant they could cut off investment in further capacity. However, they are now facing that investment and their commitment will be to sell as much as possible of the new electricity they are capable of providing in order to pay for their investment.  It is unreal to expect the ESB to be in the driving seat in relation to conservation.  Let me be very clear about this.  Obviously, all the major energy utilities will have a very <Col N="1610" /> important role to play, but the appropriate driving force should be the Department of Energy or a commission for energy conservation which would set targets to achieve instead of expecting the ESB to take on the occasional public advertising programme or to sponsor one.</P>
    <P>There are contradictions in regard to Oileáin Cléire, the Minister referred to Bellacorrick, but he wants to forget about Oileáin Cléire.  Indeed, he denies all responsibility for it and so do the ESB. An existing wind energy project providing energy for an island community is getting no support from the Department. The only support the ESB give it is to buy the supply at the price agreed and they are unwilling to do this because it is not part of their mandate to support alternative energy.  Their mandate is to produce electricity commercially and at a reasonable cost to the consumers. There is no point in expecting them to support a wind energy project.  It means that the one project which is up and running will probably fall to pieces.  At the same time the Minister announced the establishment of a new wind farm.  What will happen to that?  There is a very serious lack of organisation in relation to the development of our alternative energy sources.  This is a related element which should be looked after by the same section.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael consider that a crash insulation programme is vital; new buildings should be targeted first and old buildings second.  We welcome the new building by-law regulations in this area, but second rate standards are being implemented.  The standards which have been enormously successful in the country which hit the headlines recently for other reasons &mdash; Denmark &mdash; are not being applied here.  A great deal more could be done in this area.  It took years for those practices to become law; and indeed the whole area has been given insufficient attention and priority because the Government are not organised in this regard.  The public need to be educated and the new Structural Funds <Col N="1611" /> should be targeted in this regard.  I know that EOLAS have been working in the area of energy conservation and energy efficiency projects, which have a huge potential for input substitution.  We talk about substitution for imports and the vast bulk of our fuel is included.  We talk about highly labour intensive activities and importing techniques which could be provided here.  We are talking about wasted money, energy and employment opportunities.  The Minister should take these matters far more seriously.</P>
    <P>There is also a great opportunity for public advertising and education programmes, and a proportion of any new EC carbon taxes should be used in the first place for conservation measures as well as for reducing taxes on employment. If other countries are not interested, we should consider going it alone in relation to taxing carbon.</P>
    <P>The area of mining is being seriously under-realised.  I welcome the oil and gas exploration tax package.  The Minister got our unanimous support in this regard; indeed, we tried to push him further when we were debating the Finance Act. There is a need for further clarification in regard to minerals.  In relation to the licensing commitments which the Minister gave, will he look at the area of minerals?  Is he looking at the Act with a view to amending it to reduce some of the existing uncertainties which can cause confusion in the mining world?  Will he address the reasons for the substantial drop in employment in the mining industry in the last two decades?  This is an important issue.  Will the Minister give us an undertaking to establish a working party which will include representatives of both mining and environmental interests, given that none of the ten major discoveries during the past decade has been developed?  The reason they have not been developed is that there is hostility between mining interests and environment groups.  Will the Minister establish a working party to troubleshoot that area and produce guidelines which would be in everyone's interest?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> I welcome the review that is currently taking place within the ESB.  However, I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to the problems encountered in relation to privatisation and restructuring of the industry in Britain and to ensure that the trade unions become involved. As the Minister is aware, the major review that is currently taking place in the area of labour relations could be put at risk if this does not happen.</P>
    <P>In relation to forestry, my party spokesperson will shortly introduce a new Fine Gael policy in that area.  I also welcome the establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute.  The Minister's policy on Bord na Móna is inadequate and there is a need to establish a regional development fund.</P>

When I was appointed spokesperson on Energy I thought I would be extremely busy and find myself in a confrontation with the Minister at regular intervals, but unfortunately this has not proved to be the case.  Finally, we have come face to face with each other on the eve of the closure of the Lullymore factory, with the loss of 109 jobs, which is directly under the Minister's control, given that Bord na Móna form part of his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that this factory cannot remain open, because it is profitable and efficient and a large sum has been invested in plant and equipment there during the past seven to eight years.  The reason for the closure given by the representatives of the company is overproduction. This is rather strange. Usually we are told that the reason for closure is that a company did not perform and did not deliver the goods, but in this case people are being punished for being efficient.  Bord na Móna, and in particular the management at the Lullymore factory, are reluctant to try to find a market for their product.  It seems that they <Col N="1613" /> would prefer to turn their backs and walk away.  What they are doing in effect is to tear apart the social fabric of this rural community, which is regrettable.</P>
    <P>For some reason Bord na Móna are now walking away from the factory at Lullymore in which a high quality product was produced.  It has been estimated that the reserves will last for another 20 years.  However, Bord na Móna have been bedevilled by losses.  They have debts totalling £189 million, and despite reducing the workforce by 2,000 they have not reduced their overall debts.  Are they suggesting that if they let go a further 109 employees they will be able to reduce their losses considerably?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>In recent days a meeting took place between representatives of workers and management at Lullymore.  It has now been indicated that management will seek large sums of money so that they can engage in other areas of commercial activity and they are seeking the support of workers.  This defies description.  I think this decision was taken on ideological grounds &mdash; to take the first shot at selling Bord na Móna and the Lullymore plant in particular.</P>
    <P>Deputies on this side of the House could be forgiven for thinking in relation to recent reports &mdash; I am not trying to score political points &mdash; that there has been a breakdown in communication between the Minister and his Coalition partners.  It was stated in an article in a recent edition of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> under the heading &ldquo;New Energy Board likely to strain Coalition&rdquo; that a subcommittee of the major partner in Government has been set up, headed by Deputy Ger Connolly, to investigate the closure of Lullymore.  I regret to say that Deputy Connolly, has not been successful and has not convinced the Minister in this regard.  The Taoiseach was so concerned about this matter that he allowed this subcommittee to be set up.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will give us a satisfactory response when he comes to reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to yet another investigation in a recent edition of <i>The <Col N="1614" /> Nationalist and Leinster Times</i> under the heading &ldquo;Taoiseach investigates Wicklow Woods shock&rdquo;.  Because the Minister refused to grant approval for a joint venture between Wicklow Woods and Coillte 160 jobs have been lost in a rural area.  In relation to his policies in the energy area, it seems we have a trail of destruction and the Minister should offer us some explanation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Whitegate refinery, which is close to my own heart, it seems that we have lost the will to survive.  I can say with some pride that during the period when my party were the minority partner in Government we campaigned for the retention of Whitegate in State ownership and that we were successful. Even though it has been placed at a disadvantage and does not have modern equipment, the refinery has surived.  At present the Minister is trying to find a good partner for it, but it has been proven that with proper funding it does not need a partner.  Have we lost the will to survive? In times of war we were self-sufficient in relation to our energy requirements, but it now seems that we have lost faith in our ability as a nation to produce and guarantee security of supply in times of emergency.  This could be done by investing at Whitegate.  The matter was never fully investigated to see what byproducts could be produced to create jobs, and that is the source of great disappointment.</P>
    <P>I would imagine that the founders of Whitegate, including Mr. Seán Lemass, who played a major role in it, are not resting easily today, given the lack of a commitment on the part of the Government to try to ensure that it remains in State ownership.  I am not making an ideological argument only, even though this would be in keeping with the political position adopted by my own party.  It is essential that we have the capacity to produce petroleum products, but that is not the case at present and it is regrettable. The only thing I am happy about is that Whitegate has managed to survive despite the lack of funds and a commitment to retain it in State ownership.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that a committee <Col N="1615" /> comprised of representatives of the Minister and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are at present drawing up a plan with regard to the privatisation of the ESB.  I think the ESB have served this country well, but I have now been told that it is likely that the ESB will be subdivided into four sections, with the profitable sections being hived off.  I do not think that would be in the best interests of this nation.</P>

      <P>Time will tell. Once again the Minister's ideology has come to the fore in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to radiological protection there was a reduction in expenditure this year from £240,000 to £190,000, and within a period there have been further announcements of irresponsibility on the part of our neighbours and lives here are being threatened.  I would have thought that an increase rather than a reducation was called for.  For some reason, known to the Minister only, this most unwise reduction has been effected.  Various medical authorities have pointed out the <Col N="1617" /> dangers posed to this country by the Sellafield plant.  Yet the Minister has not taken appropriate action, placing lives here under threat.</P>
    <P>On the question of Coillte Teoranta, we are spending more than £9 million on the forestry sector within the Minister's Department while some of the greatest and oldest forests in Europe are disappearing. What has the Minister got to say about that?  What is he doing to protect our woodlands?  In this regard there appears to be complete lack of supervision by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have served this country well.  In times of crises worldwide Bord na Móna came into being here providing us with a much-needed service.  Is what we are witnessing at Lullymore the beginning of the end of Bord na Móna?  Have that body become so debt-ridden it will not be possible for them to survive?</P>
    <P>What is to happen to our mineral rights?  Is the Minister happy that the proper environmental protection will be in place in areas where there will be mineral exploration, in places of, shall we say, pilgrimage worship; are they under threat?  Can we have an assurance from the Minister there will not be any conflict between the interests of local people and/or pilgrims and of those who want to exploit such resources?</P>
    <P>On the emissions from the Moneypoint plant, will the necessary investment be made to ensure that such emissions will be considerably reduced in the future since they are posing a major threat to the surrounding population?  We must recognise that people are becoming increasingly environmentally conscious. Many Members have left to represent this country at the Rio de Janeiro Summit and we must ask: are we playing our proper part in that regard?  It would seem to me that we are not.</P>
    <P>Areas of outstanding beauty are being spoiled by the ESB pylons located along such routes.  We cannot deny the importance of tourism to our economy.  Yet these unsightly pylons are located in some of our most environmentally sensitive areas.  With a little investment <Col N="1618" /> it should be possible to rid ourselves of these eyesores in any part of the country. For example, anybody travelling in one of the most scenic parts of the country, the Barnesmore Gap in Donegal, far removed from my bailiwick but nonetheless an area of outstanding beauty, will see it is scarred by ESB activities simply because there are these unsightly pylons, in full view of tourists, running parallel with these routes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>In my brief contribution I should like to emphasise two points. First, I commend my party colleague, the Minister for Energy, and his Department, on their impressive achievements in the energy and forestry sectors in recent years and on their ambitious plans drawn up for those sectors.</P>
      <P>Second, I should like to draw attention to the invaluable input of the European Community to developments which have taken place in our energy and forestry sectors.  It is particularly appropriate, in the present climate of that input, to recognise that many vital developments in those sectors would have been impossible without Community membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The achievements of the Department of Energy in recent years become all the greater when we note that they were made against a back drop of a huge 41 per cent reduction in expenditure in the Energy and Forestry Votes.  I do not believe any Government Department experienced such a drastic budgetary reduction.  Indeed, it is a tribute to the Minister, and his staff, that they have been able to contribute so selflessly to vital further reductions in the levels of Government expenditure.  They deserve <Col N="1619" /> credit in particular for the progress they have made against that difficult background.</P>
    <P>The Department's success and ambition are underlined in the two key areas of gas and electricity.  For example, with regard to gas, work plans are well on target for the completion of the historic gas interconnector to the United Kingdom in October 1993, without doubt one of the most significant engineering projects undertaken to date by this country and one which is of crucial national importance.  Not only will this historic link allow us access to the European grid and open up the possibilities of our exporting gas but it will settle once and for all doubts about the security of gas supply in the future, thereby eliminating the fears of many people that access to this progressive, modern and environmentally-friendly product would cease at the end of life of the Kinsale gasfield. We should remember that this historic project could not have been completed without the generous support of the European Community who are providing 35 per cent of its cost.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty campaign has suffered unfairly from confusion and misinformation. Only when we witness the enormous support the EC has given such projects do we understand how misleading and damaging are some recent claims.  Membership of the European Community has been an invaluable asset to this country, enabling us to undertake projects such as the gas interconnector, which would be unthinkable in the absence of such membership.  The Minister, and his Department, have demonstrated their ability and far-sightedness in the case of the electricity generating industry and the review of its structures now under way.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on the matter of forestry.  When we consider the relevant debates taking place at the Earth Summit in Brazil we can reflect with certain satisfaction on our improving record of investment in forestry.  In 1991 we saw a record planting performance in this country in which both the State, through <Col N="1620" /> Coillte Teoranta, and the private sector made enormous advances in promoting and developing our forestry sector.  The importance of this sector was clearly identified in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which set out ambitious planting targets of 30,000 hectares by 1993 and repeat targets at this level for each year up to 2000.  That ambition has been largely met this year and will now certainly be achieved on target.  It should be remembered, in particular, that this year's figures were achieved against the huge uncertainties arising from the confusion over the shape the eventual reform of the Common Agricultural Policy would take.  Clearly the Minister's decisive action in introducing higher grants ahead of the completion of the Common Agricultural Policy reform discussions eased the emerging problem and gave a significant boost to the sector.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important that our overall forestry strategy focuses on the creation of rich value-added products which will ensure job creation in this country.  Forestry investment is, of course, almost uniquely welcome because of its benefits for the Environment and I believe we can all look forward to increasing environmental rewards for this country from the policies currently under way.</P>
    <P>Our over-riding policy objectives within the responsibilities of the Department of Energy must be the provision of competitively costed energy with every regard to security of supply and full recognition of environmental and safety concerns.  I am entirely happy that these policy objectives are being achieved admirably by the Department and again I pay tribute to the Department and to the Minister and wish them continued success in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is not unaware of the impending closure tomorrow, 5 June, of Lullymore briquette factory with an immediate loss of 109 jobs in the plant and a further loss of 50 to 60 jobs in the service industries in the general area.  I wish to register my <Col N="1621" /> deep disappointment and dismay at the lack of action by the Minister and his ministerial colleagues over the past number of weeks.  The workers at Lullymore have made repeated submissions to Government suggesting ways and means by which the plant could be kept open.  As my colleagues Deputy T. O'Sullivan and Deputy Flaherty said, Lullymore is a cost-efficent and viable plant that has sold all its produce in the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister is completely at variance with Government policy as expressed in the revised Joint Programme for Government which specifically states that it is an objective of Government to retain indigenous jobs.  The Minister is, however, presiding over the closure of a viable factory which is the embodiment of that objective.  The people in the constituency and I not only are disappointed but see this as a ministerial imprimatur to the death of Bord na Móna.  Does anybody think that the closure of Lullymore will result in a return to profitability for Bord na Móna?  If so, the Minister and the Government are sadly mistaken.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that the Minister intimated &mdash; although I cannot prove it &mdash; that the senior party in Government might give their approval to retaining Lullymore, in which case Lullymore could be saved, and perhaps the Minister would reply to this point at a later stage. I urge the Minister to take his courage in his hands, even at this late stage, and do something similar to what he did for Allenwood power station a little over a year ago.  He can give the people of Lullymore the support they need by keeping the station open.  Indeed if all fruit fails, those employed at Lullymore are prepared to operate the plant on a lease from Bord Na Móna.  Would the Minister consider giving them that option?</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate to sing a song at this stage, but does the Minister know the words of the song which goes likes this: &ldquo;Oh to be in Doonaree&rdquo;&mdash; because I want to ask a number of questions on the forest parks. The management of forest parks under Coillte Teoranta has deteriorated desperately over the past number of years. Has the Minister assessed the potential of forest parks for tourism-related job creation and other wealth-creating activities? If so, what proposals exist for exploiting the potential to the maximum degree?</P>
      <P>Second, I also wish to ask about the processing of forest produce.  A great deal of our forestry produce is sold to Northern Ireland or exported abroad and I wonder if the Minister intends to develop an all-Ireland policy for processing our wood produce so that we can benefit from the added value arising for the processing of the raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the tourism potential of forest parks, let me say that all the forests were transferred to Coillte Teoranta on the establishment of that semi-State company. Coillte Teoranta are charged with implementing Government policy on forest management.  It has been Government policy for a number of years that the forest parks would be open to the public.  Where Coillte Teoranta have come forward with specific proposals on tourism-related projects, I have encouraged them to proceed.  There is a major proposal for Lough Key Forest Park in County Roscommon and after full consideration with all the local elected representatives from all parties, which Coillte Teoranta undertook at my suggestion, there was full agreement locally on the project and I gave my official blessing to Coillte to proceed with the project which is still at the embryonic stage.  I am very conscious of the potential of the forest parks and Coillte Teoranta have responsibility under the Act for <Col N="1623" /> implementing policy and I am satisfied that within the resources available to them they are fulfilling their obligations to the best of their ability.  This is a long term policy and I hope that in time we will see major utilisation of the forests and a follow-on from the opening to the public of forest walks to more sophisticated developments, bearing in mind the potential of forests, as suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>On the question of forest produce, there is no doubt that we have an active forestry policy and it is important that we have strategic plans for the use of forest produce, which includes saw milling, the timber industry in general and the use of pulp.  Members will be aware of my Department's policy and the way it is implemented by Coillte Teoranta from the replies I gave to questions at Question Time on the necessity of the establishment of a major pulp plant to absorb the ever-increasing volume of forest produce that will become available as more and more of our large forest areas mature.  There is tremendous potential for added value and there is a great necessity to achieve the highest level of added value by processing our produce here.  At present some of our forest product is being exported because we have not yet established a pulp mill which can absorb&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The issue of the Lullymore factory has been well answered.  As the Deputies are probably aware, I had a meeting with representatives of the action group from Lullymore. I gave them the full facts of the situation and explained that the board of Bord na Móna &mdash; chaired by, I think a close friend of the Deputy's party &mdash; had made a decision that there was overproduction in the briquette manufacturing side of the Bord na Móna operation and there was an excess of one factory.  They carried out an extensive survey into the briquette manufacturing process and concluded that it was necessary to close one factory and that that factory should be Lullymore.  The board discussed this proposal and made a decision to close Lullymore.  The workers suggested during the course of discussions I had with them that the operation should be continued by them.  I should point out that no proposals as such were put before me.  I explained to them that this would defeat the purpose for which the board had made their decision &mdash; if Lullymore was to continue manufacturing briquettes it would only jeopardise the viability of the other briquette factories.</P>

      <P>The people familiar with the market who work in Bord nä Móna and who advised the board in this matter have concluded that it is necessary to <Col N="1627" /> reduce the number of production plants in order to ensure the viability of the overall briquette manufacturing side of the Bord na Móna operation.  It is in the long term interests of the viability of briquette manufacturing employment in Bord na Móna that this decision had to be made.  This decision was taken after careful analysis of all the factors involved, detailed comparisons of the advantages and disadvantages of the four existing briquette factories at Derrinlough and Croghan in County Offaly, Littleton in County Tipperary and Lullymore in County Kildare.  Total briquetting capacity in the four factories amounts to approximately 560,000 tonnes whereas projected sales in the current year amount to 400,000 tonnes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, capacity exceeds current and foreseeable demand by a little more than the equivalent of a factory's production.  Bord na Móna estimate that if sales of briquettes decline by an average of 2 per cent per annum over the next decade overcapacity will continue to increase.  Bord na Móna dealt with their overcapacity problem in 1991 by closing each of the factories in turn for a period of approximately 16 weeks. However, this arrangement did not provide sufficient savings and closure of a briquette factory is seen by the board of Bord na Móna as an essential element in the drive to improve profitability and secure the long term future of the company. Bord na Móna anticipate that the decision to close the factory will save the company approximately £10 million over the next decade.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Flaherty talking about Bord na Móna.  It is important to remember that the State supports a policy whereby the Bord na Móna operation is subsidised to the extent of approximately £35 million per year through the price paid for its peat products for electricity production in the peat burning power plants.</P>
      <P>With regard to energy conservation and efficiency, there is a dilemma here for anybody in charge of energy policy.  These plants were built with a design lifespan of 25 or 30 years.  Some of these plants have reached the end of that design lifespan and their efficiency has disimproved enormously.  This presents a very major problem for the company.  We have to recognise that the continued use of the turf and peat burning stations is not something we can expect to last indefinitely. As I have already announced, I have instructed my officials to carry out a study &mdash; Bord na Móna are carrying out a similar study &mdash; into modern technology and peat burning to see if the economics of a new technology plant would offer a viable option.  It may be possible for us to continue to exploit our valuable peat resource in this way.  A modern peat burning plant, which is deemed to be economically viable, cost efficient and able to produce electricity at a price equivalent or related to the cost of other fuels, particularly oil, would probably consume approximately one million tonnes of peat per annum.  This issue is being examined at present, but I do not want to hold out the expectation that such a plant will be built.  A decision in this regard will have to be made based on the viability of the project and other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty referred to energy conservation.  I recognise that there is a great need to increase public awareness <Col N="1629" /> of the careful use of energy.  Great savings can be achieved through the application of an energy conservation policy and I have striven to make some advances in that area.  Huge sums of money could be spent nationally on research and so on.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - National Lottery Draw.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday morning last we awoke to the news that the national lottery had closed down lotto machines across the country to block the commercial syndicate's attempt to win a jackpot of up to £2 million.  We were told about the large amounts being wagered at retail outlets throughout the country. The national lottery bosses assured us that they had nipped in the bud the attempt by the syndicate to buy up all possible options.  The national lottery asked their agents not to deal with the commercial syndicate but to continue to serve their regular customers.  Agents who had put through lottery slips for the syndicate were warned by the national lottery to stop.  In some cases where the warning was not adhered to their machines were cut off, although they were switched on again when certain commitments had been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An attempt was made to paint the syndicate as the bad boys.  We were told that the effort of the syndicate was not in the real spirit of the game, and that may be so.  I am not here to represent the syndicate &mdash; indeed, I have no involvement <Col N="1630" /> in it &mdash; but the question must be asked why did the syndicate decide to invest so much money in last Saturday's draw.  The answer is that a major blunder was made by the national lottery in offering £100 for a match four win.  This offer assured the syndicate of a return of two-thirds of their total outlay, assuming that they had all combinations covered.  The match five win, which is usually in the region of £500, guaranteed a return of almost £100,000 extra.  If we consider the overall picture, it simply highlights the madness of the national lottery in offering £100 for a match four win.  In order to cover all numbers the syndicate had to spend £973,896.  They were certain to have 6,525 match four combinations and 180 match five combinations, giving them a return of £750,000.</P>
    <P>The result of Saturday's draw showed that three successful tickets had been purchased, and indeed the syndicate were among the winners.  There is now the unreal situation in that the national lottery are refusing to pay the syndicate unless they get the names and addresses of all members of the syndicate, everybody who considered joining the syndicate and those who put through or assisted in putting through the tickets.  I find this attitude nothing short of a disgrace.  When the national lottery was set up in 1986 it was advertised as being tax free, with the confidentiality of all winners assured if the winners so desired.  The action of the national lottery on this occasion is a breach of that confidentiality.  I call on the Minister for Finance to ensure that payment be made to the syndicate immediately.  The national lottery director, Mr. Ray Bates, must assure the country that this farcical incident will never be repeated.</P>
    <P>I would highlight further the disgraceful actions of the last couple of days in relation to last Saturday night's draw. I was lucky enough to have a match four combination and I have made numerous attempts to collect the £100 in the local shop in Maynooth but have been refused on each occasion.  People will admit that since the national lottery has been set up it has been a great money spinner, far <Col N="1631" /> exceeding people's expectations. However, despite the fact that the company have a monopoly, they should not allow it to go to their heads.  It is about time they decided to run the lottery for the customers and not for themselves.  I call on the Minister to examine the matter and to ensure that there is not a repeat of this incident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there was an attempt by a commercial operation to cover all possible combinations of the national lottery's lotto game.  This is clearly not in the true spirit of the lotto game and could have serious implications for the one million regular players who play £2 and £3 a week.  I know that once the national lottery became aware of this operation the company took all the necessary action to protect the interests of the 63 per cent of all adults who play their games regularly. The company endeavoured to ensure that their agents did not exclude plays from ordinary players as a result of the efforts of the syndicate.  I fully support their efforts to protect the interests of the majority of players.</P>
      <P>The question has been raised about the payment of tax on these winnings.  This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance who will be assessing whether this group's winnings should enjoy the tax free status normally accorded to lottery winnings or if they could be regarded as investment income. A possible liability for coporation tax has also been mentioned in the media, and since this again is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to investigate I would not like to comment further on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probably inevitable that any lottery offering any large prize money, which is necessary to attract sustained public support, will also attract the attentions of syndicate groups.  The activities of regular workplace syndicates, for example, are not a problem.  Indeed, such groups are a good example of the social and entertainment value of the lottery. The area of concern is commercial syndicates <Col N="1632" /> who attempt to cover all possible plays.  This has surfaced as a problem in the United States, for example, and various methods of dealing with the problem have been adopted.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the company will be reviewing the whole incident, as requested by Deputy Power.  They will also consider the experiences elsewhere of dealing with such a problem and I await their findings.  I assure the House that any proposals they bring forward will be given the most careful and urgent consideration to ensure that the problem does not arise again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power mentioned the question of the match four winnings, and I will make his views known to the lottery company. There is no doubt that the factors that convinced the syndicate to move &mdash; although it has been widely stated that they planned the move for a long time &mdash; were the carryover of the winnings from the previous Wednesday and the match four position.  I do not necessarily agree with Deputy Power in regard to the figures given by him.  It seems that as the investment of the syndicate was about £900,000 and the winnings were £1,275,000, the estimated profit was about £375,000.  I assure Deputy Power and the House that the issues raised will be fully examined.  It is important to ensure, for people who support the lottery game, the major contributors to the fun element, and for the knock-on value to the Exchequer and many voluntary and community organisations, that the matter will be fully investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise my concern, and that of many constituents, at the response of the Department to a request from Kerry County Council for a landfill site at Muingnaminnane.  The location of landfill sites is a difficult and contentious matter for most local authorities and this one has been no less so for Kerry County Council both from the administrative side and the members' side.  After a series of <Col N="1633" /> meetings and site visits, agreement was reached by a substantial majority of the members of Kerry County Council that a site should be located at Muingnaminnane. As far as I am concerned, all the requisite conditions were complied with by Kerry County Council, including an environment impact study.  Site visitations took place as did various testings. The tests were sent to the Department on 31 December 1991 for approval in accordance with the planning regulations, in particular article 38 of the 1990 planning regulations.  I am extremely puzzled as to the delay on the part of the Department of the Environment in responding to that request.</P>
      <P>The situation is made more difficult by the pressure on Kerry County Councl due to the fact that the landfill site for the town of Tralee and its hinterland has been due for closure for a number of years and its opening has been extended only for six months at a time.  On Tuesday of last week the residents of the Tralee area went to the Circuit Court in the town seeking an injunction to close the landfill site in Tralee which is presently operating on a two hours per day basis.</P>
      <P>Kerry County Council will not have any options in relation to taking refuse and rubble, if the injuction is granted. Leave has been given to the residents of the area to reapply in July to the Circuit Court and it appears from the response of the judge that he was sympathetic to their case and may well grant the injuction forbidding Tralee Urban District Council from carrying out any further dumping at the landfill site in Tralee that has served the town for more than 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kerry County Council are adamant that they are not prepared to take any refuse to other locations in the county. The county waste plan is structured in such a way that each area must provide its own landfill.  The county has been divided into three areas.  A crisis will arise within a matter of weeks.  Tourism is important for County Kerry and, obviously, if the closure is ordered by the Circuit Court in July, a serious question <Col N="1634" /> mark will hang over the Festival of Kerry which is held in Tralee.</P>
    <P>I am inquiring as to the reason for the Department's delay in responding, in terms of carrying out the inspections of the site and in giving the go-ahead for the site.  If the all clear is given by the Minister a certain amount of planning and lining of the site will take place and the road widening and so on will take some time.  I urge the Minister to give the matter priority because it is urgent and contentious.  The Minister has the support of Kerry County Council members and officials in this regard.  I would not like to see that support being lessened by the passage of time.  This is a serious problem and I ask the Minister to give it his immediate attention, to assist Kerry County Council who have acted honourably in trying to tackle it and provide for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the existing landfill site at Tralee is seriously overtaxed and that there has been a long-running local campaign to have it closed.  The site serves the Castleisland and Sneem areas, as well as Tralee and a considerable part of north Kerry.  Kerry County Council do not dispute the contention that the Tralee site is most unsatisfactory and should be closed down.  They have been searching for a suitable alternative site over the past few years and have apparently looked at about 20 different sites.  There has been major local opposition to virtually all their potential selections.</P>
      <P>The county council were offered a site some time ago by Coillte Teoranta.  It consists of 44 acres at Muingnaminnane in the Blue Stack mountains and is located 11 kilometres north-east of Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Landfill sites having an expected annual intake of more than 25,000 tonnes are automatically subject to the EIA process. However, a site below this threshold must also be subjected to such assessment where it is likely, taking account of factors such as its nature, size and location, to have significant effects on the environment.  Kerry County Council <Col N="1635" /> arranged to have an environmental impact statement prepared in respect of the proposed Muingnaminnane development and, in accordance with the regulations, applied to the Minister to certify that the development would not, in his opinion, have significant adverse effects on the environment, or that it would embody the best practicable means to prevent or limit such effects.</P>
    <P>The Minister is obliged, when considering such an application, to have regard to the EIS as well as to any submissions or observations made to him in relation to the proposed project.</P>
    <P>The EIS for the Muingnaminnane tip site project was prepared by hydro-geological and environmental consultants engaged by Kerry County Council.  Interested persons had the opportunity to make submissions and observations in relation to the project up to 9 February 1992.  Numerous observations and submissions have been received and the various issues raised are currently being examined in my Department in conjunction with the EIS.  I hope to be in a position to convey a decision on the proposed development to the local authority in the near future.</P>

      <P>At the moment, queues form as early as 7.30 a.m. outside the <Col N="1636" /> Passport Office, so that people can be sure of getting their passports in time.  I pay a warm tribute to the staff in the Passport Office who are currently dealing with the enormous flood of applications due to the postal strike.  An additional 60 staff at least have been taken on to help the staff of the Passport Office and they are working long hours and are opening on Saturdays and bank holidays.  This is not solving the problem.  Will the Minister consider the possibility of separating the functions in the Passport Office?  It should be possible to arrange for the collection of completed passports at a different location thereby relieving some of the congestion in the offices.</P>
      <P>This afternoon some of the people at the top of the queue told me they had been there for two hours and had taken time off work to stand in the queue. Admittedly, some of the congestion is being caused by people panicking and thinking that if they need a passport within the next six to eight weeks they must queue to get it.  I appeal to people, if they do not need their passports within the next four weeks, to drop their application into the box outside the Passport Office and call back to collect it within four weeks.  I recognise the need for a good security system in the process of issuing passports but I suggest that another location could be found, perhaps with Garda protection.  Possibly one of the city centre Garda stations could make a room available where people could collect passports on production of identification.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to consider in the longer term making more offices available for the issue of passports.  There is an office in Cork where people can leave applications which are then sent to Dublin.  The passports are subsequently sent to Cork for collection.  It is important to consider opening up the Cork office for the issue of passports.  Another location in the west could also be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Department on making extra staff available.  Perhaps with a little more effort the congestion could be <Col N="1637" /> relieved and passports could be issued a little faster.</P>

I would ask the Minister to consider reviewing the whole system of allocating passports.  At present people have to travel long distances and then queue in appalling conditions.  This morning over 300 people queued outside the passport office.  Some of these had left their homes as early as 4 a.m.  Constituents of mine had to leave at 5 a.m. to be outside the office by 7 a.m.  I also spoke to a person from Belfast who had opted to take an Irish instead of a British passport and who had to queue for four hours.</P>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider the possibility that local authorities could deal with the processing and issuing of passports.  I appreciate that a passport is a very important document, but the local authorities do a very good job in handling such documents as driving licences and motor taxation discs.  I am sure they could also do a good job in relation to passports.</P>

On average 30 per cent of these are issued during the months of May and June.  Sixty per cent of all applications are normally submitted and delivered through the postal system.  As a result of the postal dispute, however, the vast majority of these applications have to be submitted and collected in person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very large increase in the number of persons calling to the Passport Office <Col N="1638" /> is causing considerable difficulties both for members of the public and for the Passport Office.  To date the following measures have been taken: over 100 extra members of staff have been recruited on a temporary basis, in addition to the normal staff complement of about 40. Extra overtime is being worked on a continual basis.  The Passport Office is a being opened each Saturday to facilitate the collection of passports.  It was also open on the Bank Holiday Monday this week. Priority is being given to those members of the public who are travelling in the immediate future.  Arrangements are also in place so that members of the public may deliver their applications and/or collect their passports either in person, through a courier system such as the Sure Parcel Service or EMS operated by An Post or by an agreed third party.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that a solution to the problem would be to open an additional centre for distributing passports. As Deputies are aware, we have a Passport Office at Cork which currently handles over 10 per cent of all applications. There are a number of complex issues involved in opening further distribution centre, including costs, administrative arrangements and, above all, security.  For these reasons, and particularly as the current dispute seems to be nearing an end, I would be reluctant to open an additonal distribution centre at this time.  However, I would assure the House that the situation is being monitored on a daily basis and we will continue to review the possibility of additional measures which might help to alleviate the current problems.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, the Office of Public Works have done their usual excellent job on the arterial drainage scheme on the Bonet river in County Leitrim and we thank them for it.  Unfortunately, however, there are some exceptions to this blanket praise.  For instance, the Lower Bonet from Dromahair to Lough Gill has not been touched; neither has the Killary River.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the stretches of the <Col N="1639" /> Upper Bonet in the areas of Mullies and Glenade which were originally included as part of the scheduled works.  I asked very specific questions about these stretches in the Dáil on 7 May last and received a very full reply from the Minister of State.  I did not like the contents of his reply, but it was thorough.  He told me it has been decided to suspend work indefinitely on the Bonet catchment scheme.  He said the stretches of the Upper Bonet in the areas of Mullies and Glenade were included as part of the scheduled works on this drainage scheme and that works in these areas had not been completed.  He gave the reasons. He also told me there were no plans at present to complete the drainage works. That was not good news for me or for the farmers in the area who had approached me.</P>
    <P>This week I read the heading in the <i>Leitrim Observer</i> that the Bonet scheme will be completed.  A report was given of a meeting in Manorhamilton which was told that the Minister for Finance had given a verbal commitment that all sections of the river included in the original proposed scheme would be completed. Nothing could be more definite than that.  The meeting was also told there was confidence that the money could be found in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister of State what <Col N="1640" /> the true position is.  Is it the story told to me in answer to a Dáil question that the work on the Bonet catchment has been suspended indefinitely, that the Mullies and Glenade stretches have not been completed and that there are no plans at present to complete the drainage works? Is it the story told to the meeting in Manorhamilton that all sections will be completed and that there is a good chance the money will be found in this year's budget?  I hope it is the latter.</P>

      <P>The reasons that drainage works have not been completed in the Mullies and Glanade areas are twofold, environmental and economic.  The upper reaches of the River Bonet contain important fish spawning grounds and drainage work would, without doubt, cause some damage.  Consequently the situation is under review and when we have completed that review a <i>de facto</i> conclusive decison will be made.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 5 June 1992.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme is the subject of continuing review to see what changes if any, subject to budgetary constraints, can be made to improve the structures of the scheme.  The introduction of a Community Employment Development Programme was included in the measures announced by the Taoiseach on 30 April 1992, aimed at the long term unemployed in the 12 areas involved in the area based strategy for long term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme is a development of the social employment scheme and will involve the incorporation of a training element in projects with more than 15 participants.  The programme will commence as soon as arrangements have been established for the inclusion of a <Col N="1576" /> training element in these projects.  The programme will be evaluated in conjunction with the other special measures announced by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department and FÁS recently met with the county managers to discuss the operation of the social employment scheme by local authorities whose projects represent about 35 per cent of participants on the scheme. There may be scope for improving the structure of the scheme as operated by the local authorities including the introduction of a training element.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the scheme in 1992 is projected at £72.9 million which is being met in full by the Exchequer as no ESF aid is available for the scheme in 1992. This will provide opportunities for an average of 11,000 people each week.</P>

      <P>The number and distribution of Labour Court hearings and disputes dealt with by the Labour Relations Commission would not justify the establishment of a division of the court or the location of industrial relations officers of the LRC outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court conducted 630 hearings during 1991, of which 438, 70% were held in Dublin and 192, 30%, were held in 22 other locations throughout the country, Industrial relations officers of the Labour Relations Commission dealt with 1,880 disputes in 1991 of which 921, 49%, were in Dublin, 279, 15%, in the rest of Leinster, 469, 25%, in Munster and 211, 11%, between Connaught and Ulster.</P>
      <P>The fact that divisions of the Labour Court and industrial relations officers of the Labour Relations Commission are based in Dublin does not in any way impede either body in dealing with disputes outside Dublin.  In my view, both bodies provide important services in a cost efficient and effective manner.  I should point out that any decentralisation of either body would only increase costs and would reduce flexibility in responding to cases.  In addition, the centralisation of services facilities coordination and exchanges of views within the court and the commission and uniformity in their dealings with industrial relations matters.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the normal working week in Ireland is considerably less than 48 hours.  The Framework Agreement on Hours of Work negotiated under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provided for a reduction of working hours by one hour in cases where the normal working week was at or above 40 hours.  This agreement has generally been implemented throughout the economy.</P>
      <P>Any further reduction in the working week would be a matter for negotiation and agreement between all the interests involved.  This issue was discussed in the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> but agreement was not reached on the issue.  The programme states that the ICTU have indicated that they will, in the event of negotiations for a further agreement, be seeking a general reduction in working time in the context of international developments and the economic and social situation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is referring to a maximum of 48 working hours per week, as proposed under the draft EC Directive on the Organisation of Working Time, I would refer to my reply to Questions Nos. 5 and 24 from Deputies Therese Ahearn and Gilmore.  It will be appreciated that the introduction of a statutory maximum working week of 48 hours without exceptions for particular cases could create very substantial practical difficulties in many types of employment.  In addition, just as the gap between growth and jobs is not what economic theory suggests it should be, it is not clear that the removal of the working of systematic overtime leads automatically to the creation of further employment &mdash; there is much evidence to suggest that the gap is often bridged by new technology and increased productivity.</P>
      <P>I would not anticipate moving ahead on this issue purely on a national basis. I feel we should await the outcome of discussions in the draft Directive.  Every attempt will be made to reach agreement in the matter on 24 June.</P>

The guide will be a &ldquo;live&rdquo; document and will be updated on a regular basis by ABT; five-six regional seminars on exporting will be organised by ABT in early September for manufacturers who rely exclusively on the domestic market; the Minister has requested An Bord Tráchtála to extend its Marketing Consultants Programme to include the assignment of design consultants to firms in the clothing sector.</P>

      <P>There are no defence commitments for Ireland under the Treaties establishing the European Communities or the Single European Act.  This position will not change under the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.  The European Union will not be empowered, under the Treaty's provisions, to act in the defence area.</P>
      <P>Discussions and decisions on the scope and content of a common defence policy and on the question of a common defence for the Union are left to a future negotiation and another intergovernmental conference to take place in 1996.  The outcome of that negotiation will require the unanimous approval of all the member states.  It is very likely that the outcome of such a negotiation, if it is of any substance, could not be ratified here without a constitutional amendment and the Taoiseach accordingly has stated that a further referendum will be necessary at that point in relation to any proposals which emerge.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty establishes a relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union, WEU, which is set out in Article J.4 of the Chapter on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  Under this Article, the Union requests the Western European Union, which is described as an integral part of the development of the European Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty does not oblige Ireland to join the Western European Union or to take up any obligations under the Treaty establishing the Western European Union or to subscribe to any of the policy positions adopted by the Western European Union.  At the time of the Maastricht European Council, however, the member states of the Western European Union in a separate declaration issued an invitation to the members of the European Union who are not members of the Western European Union &mdash; Ireland, Denmark and Greece &mdash; to accede to the Western European Union on conditions to be agreed or to <Col N="1595" /> become observers.  The Government do not intend that Ireland should become a member of the Western European Union but they see advantages in Ireland taking up observer status in the Western European Union and this possibility is now under consideration.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, health boards may pay a weekly supplement towards the rent costs of persons whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The supplement is calculated so that, after payment of rent, the recipient has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his family size, less £3.50.  This method of determining rent supplements applies in all health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining applications for rent supplements the health board must be satisfied that the rent payable is fair and reasonable for the particular property.  It is also necessary for a board to establish that the accommodation is appropriate <Col N="1596" /> to the needs of the applicant.  Differences in rent levels between or within health board areas may also affect the amount of supplement payable.</P>
