      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 dealing with two different topics.  I propose to deal with these two topics separately.  I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputies John Bruton, De Rossa, Spring, Garland and MacGiolla.  I call first on Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given me notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the decision of the Danish people to reject the Treaty on European Union signed at Maastricht I am seeking the Adjournment of the Dáil, under Standing Order 30, to debate the urgent and important matter of its consequences for our country and for the other member states of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the implications for Ireland and the European Community of the outcome of the Danish referendum in which <Col N="1174" /> the Danish people declined to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, the need for the Government to take the legislative steps required to postpone the referendum scheduled here for 18 June as the Maastricht Treaty, in its present form, is now a dead letter and the absolute necessity for the Government to seek a renegotiation of the Treaty, to address its many shortcomings, in particular, and to secure the deletion of Protocol 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I served notice of my intention to raise a matter under Standing Order 30 at the commencement of public business as follows: (1) That Dáil Éireann views with extreme concern the decision of the Danish people to reject the Treaty on European Union; (2) Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to take the necessary legislative steps to postpone the referendum due to take place in Ireland on 18 June in order to allow for any necessary clarification and development of the position.  I would have to say, Sir, that the position in relation to the Order of Business for today, in offering ten minute statements, is a total insult to democracy, is totally inadequate since there is a crisis and an absolute constitutional absurdity facing the people on 18 June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can take a reasonable guess at your deliberation on this, Sir, but I would suggest to the Taoiseach that this House, indeed every Member of it, should be heard on this issue today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Deputy Spring, there will be time for that today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose a motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the failure of the Government to postpone or abandon the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on 18 June in view of the fact that Denmark has rejected this Treaty, which <Col N="1175" /> means the Treaty cannot come into force without the unanimous consent of all 12 member countries of the European Community, and the fact that (1) the abortion question &mdash; dealing with the issues of freedom to travel, information and the possible introduction of limited abortion has not yet been settled; (2) the postal dispute which has not yet been settled and (3) the High Court action due to take place tomorrow regarding Government expenditure in promoting a biased campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil for the purposes of discussing the implications for Government policy with regard to the Treaty on European Union of the vote by the Danish people to reject the Maastricht Treaty and the need for the Government to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been given notice that statements on this matter will be taken after Question Time today.  Accordingly, as the Dáil, in practice, will have an opportunity of discussing the matter, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case, Sir, that you must decide Standing Order 30 on the merits of what is contained in it, that any separate proposals the Government might be proposing to make in the future in regard to that matter are not amongst the matters contemplated in Standing Order 30 and, therefore, do not constitute grounds for refusal of a motion under Standing Order 30?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only tell the House that the Dáil is allowed discuss this matter today by way of statements. Accordingly one of the long established guidelines for allowing such matters has not been met, namely, the matter is not likely to develop significantly before the <Col N="1176" /> Dáil, in practice, will have had an opportunity of discussing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being offered ten-minute statements which will not give some parties in the House an opportunity to speak on the issue.  I also wish to point out that we are in the middle of a referendum campaign, a campaign which is fast becoming a total absurdity.  The Government are offering ten-minute statements when they should be coming before the House giving the legal position offered to them.  Will the Government come before the House and give the legal position which has been put before them by, I presume, the Attorney General? Ten-minute statements on this issue are not adequate and I again ask the Taoiseach to give more time to debate this issue in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are using the device of ten-minute statements to undermine what is clearly the right of this House to debate this issue.  I believe that if the Government had not proposed this ten-minute statement device the House would have been adjourned to debate this issue at length so that every Deputy would have an opportunity to make a contribution.  It seems to me that the Government are abusing the Standing Orders of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the ten-minute statements because I will not get an opportunity of saying anything.  I am totally excluded and censored from speaking in this House on the issue.  I object to the arrangement in relation to these statements which is being suggested by the Taoiseach in order to avoid any element of debate on the matter.  I object to this proposal on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest very strongly at the absence of any input from the Green Party into this debate.  It is outrageous that the Green Party and The Workers' Party should be totally excluded from this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand you to say, a Cheann Comhairle, that Deputies will have an opportunity to contribute to these statements?  Is that the case or will ordinary Deputies like me be excluded from contributing to the debate on this critical issue?  Will you clarify your statement on that point, Sir?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Order of Business will clarify matters but I agree that all Members will obviously not be facilitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I wish to protest at this proposal as 54 members of our party will not have an opportunity to speak.  This is a clear tactic by the Taoiseach to block an open discussion on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we have to accept your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle, on motions raised under Standing Order 30, even though we may not like it.  The circulation of a proposed Order of Business which gives ten minutes to a small number of Deputies seriously compromises you, Sir, in terms of your decision under Standing Order 30.  For example, it seems it cannot be assumed that this Order of Business will be carried. All it is a proposal for business. Therefore, how can something which is a mere proposal for business weigh on a <Col N="1178" /> decision under Standing Order 30?  This seems to be highly improper.  I join with the other Deputies in the House who suggest that on this occasion every Member of the House has a right to express their opinion as elected representatives and that the putting together of a set of resolutions under Standing Order 30 and the Order of Business is improper.</P>

      <P>Order.  I am about to make a statement, Deputy.  I have to remind Members that the only motion before the House under Standing Order 30 is that the House do adjourn to allow a discussion on the matter raised. Statements under Standing Order 41 treat the matter in a very similar way.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, is it not the case that in the event of your accepting my motion under Standing Order 30 I would have an opportunity, having moved the motion, to contribute at the end of the debate having heard the other speakers, whereas under the Statements now proposed the main Opposition party, which consists of 55 Deputies, will have but one speaker who will not have an opportunity to comment on anything which happens subsequently in the debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 10.  It is also proposed that Statements shall be made after Question Time today under Standing Order 41 in relation to the European Union Treaty and that the following arrangements shall apply: (1)  the statement of the Taoiseach and of the speakers for the Fine Gael, Labour, Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left parties shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and (2)  the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be called on to make a statement in reply not exceeding ten minutes.  It is further proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that: (1)  the sitting shall not be suspended today at 1.30 p.m. and (2)  there will be no Private Members' Business this week. To facilitate the House, and perhaps some of the arguments being made here, I would add that I received a late request from Deputy Bruton, Leader of Fine Gael, to extend the ten minutes to 20 <Col N="1184" /> minutes and I am quite agreeable to accede to that request.  I would regard the statements made here today purely as initial reactions of the leaders of the parties.  I can assure Deputies that the House and the country will be kept fully informed of the matter and there will be other opportunities for debate as the position is clarified.  There may be a crisis in Denmark today but there is no crisis in Ireland, despite the efforts of some politicians to try to create that impression in people's minds.  There is no crisis, there will be no crisis and the referendum will be held on 18 June.</P>

I further propose an amendment to paragraph (2)  after &ldquo;The Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be called on to make a statement in reply not exceeding ten minutes&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and at the end of that reply the Minister shall have a further ten minutes to answer any questions that may be put to him on matters raised in the debate by other Members of the House&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I sought to make the point earlier that we are being asked to deal with item No. 10, the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, when the Minister is absent, the Green Paper has not been circulated and the Minister has just this morning circulated 40 amendments. This is clearly an opportunity for this House to debate without restriction the events that occurred in Denmark yesterday. I support in principle the proposal made by Deputy Bruton.  However, I do not think he should have applied the ten speaker limit to the debate.  All Deputies who wish to contribute to the debate should be enabled to do so, albeit, as Deputy Bruton may argue, in proportion to party size.  I have no problem whatsoever with that proposal.  There are Deputies here who have a view to express on this issue and they should be enabled to do so.</P>

I have said quite clearly that a debate at this stage would provide an opportunity for reaction from leaders of the parties in this House.  There cannot be a real debate this afternoon in this House because we do not know what the Commission will say today, what the Presidency will say or what the Danish people will do.  This is a crisis for Denmark but not for Ireland and no effort by parties to try to paper over cracks in the unity within their own parties will force me into a debate that will lead to nothing but further confusion.</P>

There are 166 Members in this House who were elected by the people because they believed we have views on the issues that face us.  Why should the Taoiseach assume that because Members other than the party leaders want to speak in this House this is indicative of a crisis, disunity or of anything else other than that we are doing our job as legislators and want to debate this matter?

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No.9:</P>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 23, to delete &ldquo;Minister considers&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;vocational education committee recommends&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister considers that this Act should apply to any other educational institution, the Minister may, by order, made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and following consultation with the vocational education committee, amend the said First Schedule by inserting in column (1) thereof the name of the institution...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to delete the phrase &ldquo;Minister considers&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;vocational education committee recommends&rdquo;.  This amendment is very timely.  I am appalled at the 43 amendments circulated by the Minister this morning.  Effectively they remove any role remaining to the vocational education committees in relation to regional colleges.  These colleges were developed by the vocational education committees over a 20 year period and they are the great educational success of the State. The Minister in introducing these amendments seeks to change that and to remove altogether any role for the vocational education committees.  The proposed amendments change the Bill completely and are at variance with what the Minister's predecessors presented on Second Stage and previously on Committee Stage.  The whole thrust of the Bill has <Col N="1197" /> been changed since Second Stage and we are moving away from local democratic control.  My amendment seeks to remove the thrust towards centralisation which is to be copperfastened by the ministerial amendments.</P>
    <P>This is a retrograde step in terms of third level education.  We saw a newspaper report on Monday relating to a letter which emanated from the Minister's Department preventing regional colleges from expanding in relation to the conferring of degrees.  Twenty-two applications were dealt with and all but one were knocked.  The Department want to operate on a guideline which will allow 10 per cent of students in regional colleges to pursue degree courses.  This is an example of discrimination against the regions in favour of Dublin.  The regional colleges provide about 10 per cent of their students with degree courses. Thirty per cent of the courses provided by the Dublin Institute of Technology are degree courses.  If we include Maynooth, there are four universities servicing Dublin and a Dublin Institute of Technology which is providing 30 per cent degree courses to students.  This is against the backdrop of a guideline of 10 per cent degree courses in regional colleges.  There are colleges like the college in my constituency, which from September will be providing 60 per cent degree courses, but it is obviously the intent of the Government and of the Department of Education to undermine that.</P>
    <P>I should welcome the Minister's response.  He represents the south-east region which has been badly neglected in terms of economic, industrial and commercial growth.  If there is not a proper provision of degree courses, the economic development of the region will be sadly undermined.</P>
    <P>The basic principle in my amendment is that the Department of Education in Dublin is not the proper place for education policy and administration to come from.  This Government make great play of the subsidiarity provision in the Maastricht Treaty, something we all welcome, but here the Government are flying <Col N="1198" /> absolutely in the face of that principle. Those Deputies on the Government side who support these amendments will never be forgiven nor forgotten because of the horrible effect they will have.  I understand the Minister was to submit the Green Paper to the Cabinet this morning.  It is obvious from leaks that the Government intend to abolish vocational education committees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These amendments have been changed.  I conclude by saying that these are disgraceful amendments.  They run in the face of subsidiarity, they are a kick in the teeth to the vocational education committees throughout the country which have developed these colleges so wonderfully during the past 20 years. This is sounding the death knell of democratic control of education and moving back to centralisation in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to wish the Minister, who unfortunately is ill, a speedy recovery.  Having said that, I would remind the House that two weeks ago we were approached by the Minister <Col N="1199" /> with a view to having this Bill resumed and taken.  We promised to be as cooperative as possible and to agree to certain time constraints and a certain timetable. As has been said, instead of giving us, as the Minister promised, plenty of advance notice &mdash; something to which we are entitled both in terms of courtesy and from the point of view of an adequate deliberation of the amendments &mdash; we now have a situation where all these amendments, dated 3 June, arrived this morning and we are expected between now and 2.30 p.m. and between 5 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. as well as two or three hours tomorrow, to deal with all our own reasoned amendments along with those amendments which arrived this morning.</P>
      <P>I should like to put the House on notice that tomorrow morning, when it comes to guillotining this Bill, we will be objecting. In the interest of a proper debate to do justice to what is very significant legislation, I appeal that there would be no time constraints tomorrow and that Committee Stage be allowed to continue into next week if necessary.</P>
      <P>I support amendments Nos. 9 and 10. The vocational education system has served the country well and has stood the test of time.  The Vocational Education Act, 1930, is a monument to good legislation. Furthermore, I believe the heavy hand of the Minister applies throughout the length and breadth of this Bill in various sections where it is stated &ldquo;whenever the Minister considers&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo; and so on.  We are talking about vocational education committees made up of nominated persons, local authority members and directly elected members.  They have, over a span of years since 1930, served education extremely well, have been highly responsible in relation to the discharge of their duties and have given us a system of vocational education of which we can be truly proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments are seeking to give back some vestige of power to vocational education committees rather than have their roles, duties and functions completely overridden.  I support the basic <Col N="1200" /> thrust of section 3 (2) and (3) where an allowance is made for taking on board and for establishing new regional technical colleges.  It should not be the sole jurisdiction of the Minister to decide. Section 3 (2) states:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister considers that this Act should apply to any other educational institution, the Minister may, by order, made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and following consultation with the vocational education committee...</P>
    <P>It should be up to the vocational education committees, having deliberated on the needs of the particular county or region of a functional area, to decide whether or not they will make the recommendation to the Minister.  Obviously, the vocational education committee will not make a recommendation unless they have a very strong case.  What I am saying, therefore, by means of this amendment is that the vocational education committee would have a right, having deliberated fully the requirements of an area, to make full representation to the Minister and that the initiative would come from the vocational education committee. Inevitably very strong cases will be presented.  There is much compelling evidence &mdash; I have made that point in the House already and I will not dwell on it unduly today &mdash; that Mayo has one of the highest participation rates in third level education.  There is a mass exodus every September and every weekend to third level colleges.  Similarly, Tipperary has a very high participation rate.</P>
    <P>The city of Galway has a regional technical college and a university and is the gateway to Connemara.  Music is potentially one of the biggest growth sectors in this country.  Galway is half way between Donegal and Kerry and has an outstanding case for a college of music.  I do not believe a case has been made by County Galway Vocational Educational Committee or Galway City Vocational Educational Committee for a college of music.  They should have a right, if they consider there is a strong case for a college <Col N="1201" /> of music, to take the initiative themselves.</P>
    <P>I would make the point in support of the creation of new RTCs in Mayo and Thurles that rural Ireland is dying.  One diocese in the west has lost the equivalent of 33 parishes in the last 60 years.  The Commission of the European Communities memorandum on higher education in the European Community has identified regional technical colleges as a key stimulus to growth in the regions. They state:</P>
    <P>The very presence of a higher education institution in a region represents an investment around which a number of services will grow.  It makes an area a pole of attraction for investment on account of the availability of highly trained manpower so necessary to the success of modern enterprise.  A higher education facility represents a resource of knowledge, advice and research which can be availed of by business and industry.</P>
    <P>It is an automatic magnet.  It is a key element in relation to regional policy. That is why a vocational education committee should be permitted to take its own initiative, to present its own case and to have that case duly deliberated on by the Minister.  On two accounts I make a plea, first, that we strengthen the role of the vocational education committees by accepting this amendment, and, second, that we enable this section to have a stronger muscle than at present by allowing vocational education committees to take initiatives in relation to making representations for additional third level facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There was much talk this morning about matters being debated in a vacuum.  We are having this debate in a vacuum.  First, we are having it in the absence of the Minister for Education.  I join with Deputy J. Higgins in expressing regret at the fact that the Minister is ill and cannot be with us and I wish him a speedy recovery.  It is regrettable also that he is not with us for the debate because since his appointment as Minister <Col N="1202" /> for Education he has signalled a significant shift in educational policy.  First, he made it clear that he wished to put his own stamp on the promised Green Paper, the original draft of which was published prior to Christmas in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  At the beginning of June we are still awaiting the publication of the Green Paper. Although the Minister promised in this House that the Green Paper would be published before the end of May, there were press reports to the effect that because of his hospitalisation it will now be delayed.  The fact is that the Green Paper has not been published, apart from the rather unusual approach of publishing an introduction in advance of the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>First, we are having this debate in the absence of the Minister.  Second, we are having it in the absence of a Minister who has signalled a change in Government policy.  Third, we are having it in the absence of the Green Paper that was promised to us; and, fourth, we have before us 43 amendments which substantally change the whole thrust of this Bill.</P>
      <P>These amendments concern themselves with the extent to which the vocational education committees or the Minister for Education will be calling the shots, specifically in this case in relation to the establishment of colleges.  That in a way is what this whole debate is about. Will the Minister for Education and the Department of Education be calling the shots in relation to the regional technical colleges?  Will the vocational education committees have a real role in this whole area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two amendments we are now debating run completely counter to the 43 amendments which have been submitted by the Minister.  The Minister's amendments are effectively to drive the vocational education committees out of third level education.  They fly in the face of the statements made here on Second Stage.  When this Bill was introduced the then Minister &mdash; three Ministers ago &mdash; indicated that the whole purpose of this Bill was to provide a balance between, on the one hand giving a certain degree <Col N="1203" /> of autonomy and independence to the regional technical colleges to allow them to grow and further develop and on the other hand, maintaining a system of public accountability through the vocational education committees.  That degree of accountability is clearly being driven out of this Bill by the Minister's amendments.  The two amendments that we are now debating seek to reinforce that degree of public accountability.</P>
    <P>This debate will be very difficult for us to conduct because we do not have the Minister with us and we do not have the Green Paper setting out Government policy.  All we have is an introduction to the Green Paper, but we do not know what the detail of the Green Paper will be.  For example, aim No. 6 in the Green Paper is about devolution and accountability. It reads in a way that most Members of this House would find difficult to disagree with.  It says that the re-organisation proposed involves large scale devolution of administration throughout the education system and that following directly from this increased autonomy is the need for adequate systems of accountability so that State resources are seen to be best employed and national priorities in education followed. In the context of third level education, and specifically in the context of the regional technical colleges, we do not know what that grandiose statement comes down to.  I would have assumed, given the introduction to the Green Paper, that the vocational education committees were to be retained and that that would involve some reinforced role for the vocational education committees in the regional technical colleges.  Now we have a raft of amendments from the Minister which run completely contrary to that.  One wonders what, if any, role the vocational education committees will have in the regional technical colleges.  Is it to be a purely nominal role?  We need to know.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Green Paper is ready. We are told that it is being presented to the Government.  We were told here only two weeks ago that it would be published <Col N="1204" /> before the end of May.  The Minister should now put on the record of this House the chapter of the Green Paper that deals with the regional technical colleges so that before we get further into the nuts and bolts of this debate we will know exactly what is Government policy now in relation to the regional technical colleges.  We can only guess at it from the glimmer we were given in the introduction to the Green Paper and in the context of the amendments which have been table before us today by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Many more Green Papers have been published and are gathering dust on various shelves.  We have had a very unusual sequence of events in relation to this Green Paper.  A Green Paper was leaked to the newspapers last year.  Then we had a succession of three Ministers for Education, ending up with the present Minister for Education, who said he wanted to put his own personal stamp on the Green Paper.  That turned out to be a statement of intent to effectively change what was in the Green Paper.  We then had the unusual step whereby, instead of publishing the Green Paper during the week of the teacher union conferences, the Minister published an introduction to it.  We still do not have the Green Paper; yet we now have legislation which we imagine would be based in some way on the contents of the Green Paper.  All records have been broken here.  We have no Green Paper, an introduction has been published and now legislation is being implemented on the basis of a Green Paper which has not yet seen the light of day.</P>
    <P>We really do not know what is Government policy in this area.  We have some idea of what the policy was when Deputy O'Rourke was Minister for Education. We then had Deputy Davern, who took the earlier part of the Committee Stage of this debate, and I have to say there were certain things which Deputy Davern put on the record of this House which seemed to be in conflict with what his predecessor had to say.  We now have a third Minister, who has a different approach to it, and we still do not have <Col N="1205" /> the Green Paper.  The Minister of State should begin his contribution to this resumed Committee Stage debate by telling us what is the Government's policy and what is in the Green Paper in relation to the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>I support the amendments that have been tabled here because I am very much in support of the system of accountability which exists through the vocational education committees.  I am very much opposed to driving the vocational education committees out of third level education, which is what the Minister's amendments are about.  They will create absolute chaos in relation to the administration of the regional technical colleges, in relation to public accountability and specifically in relation to the whole staffing area and the question of the employment relationship.</P>
    <P>We need some clarity because, as the Taoiseach said this morning, there is not much point in having a debate in a vacuum; and, as far as the Government's education policy is concerned, we certainly are in one mighty vacuum at the commencement of this debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy, please do not indulge in cross-examination. I am telling you the position.  I <Col N="1206" /> know that if I were out where you are, having regard to the interest I have in vocational education, I would be as interested but I must advise the House of what is appropriate to Committee Stage debate, and it is not an occasion where we indulge to any great extent in forebodings, suspicions or frustrations.  We must deal with what is in the amendments before us and if we do that we will make much better headway.  That is the position. Otherwise, we should reject the whole debate and not have it.  The Chair must see to it that the debate is carried out in accordance with what is appropriate on Committee Stage when we deal with what is specifically before us.</P>

      <P>I firmly believed he could not do so because from what I have determined from the initiation of the Bill is that there is no Government policy on education.  This Bill has been scrutinised by three different Ministers, all with different views and all placing different emphasis on the legislation.  It seems that there is no Government policy on education. As each Minister takes up office they place emphasis on a different aspect. It is a sad reflection on the Government that at this stage they have not decided in what direction Irish education should go.  It is not good enough for each Minister for Education on taking up office to put forward a different idea.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt, Deputy Ahearn, but it is not good enough for you to take that direction now.  Before the Committee there are two amendments, in the names of Deputies O'Shea, Mac Giolla and Garland, and Deputies should apply themselves to those amendments.  If it is not the Deputy's intention to do that she will <Col N="1207" /> have to wait for some other occasion when she will be in order to proceed in the direction she has taken.  The Chair must advise Deputies of what is appropriate on Committee Stage.  If the Deputy applies herself to the amendments she will make a much more commendable contribution to the legislation</P>
      <P>In passing, I might say that we all regret the circumstances of the Minister's absence, and the Chair would like to be associated with the comments by Deputies Gilmore and Higgins in relation to the Minister's enforced absence in so far as he is in hospital.  We are now discussing amendments Nos. 9 and 10, and remarks should be confined to them.</P>

      <P>I felt obliged to comment on the fact that, as far as I can see, there is no Government education policy.</P>
      <P>I join with the good wishes of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and my colleagues, to the Minister and hope he has a speedy recovery.  We accept that his absence today is completely unavoidable but I do not accept that his absence on other occasions when education matters were being discussed was unavoidable.  It is alarming to think of the number of occasions when education matters were raised in the House and the Minister was not in attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister's absence today is unavoidable, what has been carried out this morning in his name and by his Department, in the placing of up to 50 new amendments before the Committee, is inexcusable.  There can be no acceptable explanation for the delay in tabling those amendments and making them available so that there might be a positive debate.  If this is the Minister's attitude <Col N="1208" /> towards what I consider a very important Bill, which has been awaited for a long time and if he considers it appropriate to land an enormous amount of amendments, indicating a great change in direction, just an hour before the beginning of Committee Stage &mdash; that is not good enough.  A Minister who wanted good, comprehensive legislation to emerge would ensure that amendments placed in his name would come in time for all parties to consider them in a calm and considered way.  It is only under those circumstances that we might end up with a Bill that would promote and better the facilities in our regional technical colleges, an objective we all aspire to.  I hope that during Committee Stage we will not again be faced with further amendments.</P>
    <P>I support the amendments tabled.  It would be a very retrograde step to dismiss the opinions of the vocational education committees in relation to the need for regional colleges in different areas.  The step being taken goes in the opposite direction to moves by other Departments. When a new body is being established, be it in industry or otherwise, a committee is generally set up to determine the local position and the needs of a particular area.  There is no better body in the educational field to identify the needs of an area than vocational educational committees.  They have acted responsibly to date and have shown tremendous interest and enthusiasm in preparing proposals and in the initiatives they have taken in relation to regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>I speak from experience in my own constituency of South Tipperary.  The North Tipperary vocational education committee and the south Tipperary vocational education committee have taken the initiative and carried out an enormous amount of background work in seeking to establish a regional technical college in Thurles.  Such actions reflect the major initiatives vocational educational committees have taken.  We should build on the experience and the good work that has been carried out in that area and on the responsible approach that has been taken to date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> It would be a retrograde step to put vocational education committees to one side; for the Minister to take absolute responsibility and give the vocational education committees only a consultative role.  The Minister will need guidance, direction and information and someone will have to research the needs of particular areas.  There is no body better qualified to do that than the body responsible for education in the area, the vocational education committee. Vocational education committees are representative of the community, of the business life and of the educational establishments. The Minister would benefit greatly from the initiatives taken by the vocational education committees.  They feel that they have been downgraded by the Minister's measures and that the work they have carried out to date has been overlooked.  The Minister should reconsider his position and support the amendments tabled.</P>

      <P>It is not surprising that there is confusion about this Bill, which has been discussed since November last and under three Ministers.</P>
      <P>The two amendments are a crucial development in the whole debate on the Bill.  What will be the role of the vocational education committees?  Will they have any role?  Is the Minister taking complete control of the regional technical colleges?  Is he treating them as second level or even primary schools in the way he is retaining control in decision making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Minister overseeing the passage of the Bill, Minister O'Rourke, seemed amenable to the concept of the Department of Education taking control from the vocational education committees and reducing the level of control that committees would have.  Her successor took a much firmer line in favour of the vocational education committees and seemed willing to make changes in the Bill in that regard.  The present Minister seems to be the worst of the three in so far as democratic control and the interests of the vocational education committees are concerned.  He seems to <Col N="1210" /> be opting for centralised control and a policy of privatisation wherever possible. These amendments are crucial in the context of the battle going on in the Department of Education with Ministers and vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Most of the political arguments have been made by other speakers but the amendments about which we are speaking simply give the initiative to the vocational education committees to make a decision; the Minister still has total control because although you alter &ldquo;whenever the Minister considers that this Act should apply to any other educational institution, etc.&rdquo; to &ldquo;whenever the vocational education committees consider that this Act should apply to any other educational institution&rdquo;, that is followed by &ldquo;the Minister may, by order, made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, etc.&rdquo;, which means that the Minister makes the final decision.  The Minister need not be worried about these amendments and should be prepared to accept them because the vocational education committees are much more in touch with colleges and institutions in their area and would be able to recommend a proposal to the Minister.  The Minister could still then make the decision, by order.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept these amendments which mean retaining democratic control while still leaving power in the hands of the Minister to make a decision in relation to a recommendation. The amendments mean that there would be a certain amount of initiative to make proposals to the vocational education committees, which are democratically based in the area and which are not as remote as the Department of Education on which the Minister would rely.  Indeed the Department of Education seem to be getting more remote every day from the situation on the ground and they and the Department of Justice are the two most entrenched and conservative Departments in the Civil Service and Government.  It is important that the Minister listens to the vocational education committees as well <Col N="1211" /> as to the Department of Education.  The vocational education committees know the parents, pupils, the educational institutions and the people of the area and could advise in relation to many problems. This has been proved by the fabulous success of the RTCs under the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The Bill is supposed to give more autonomy to the RTCs but instead they are being placed increasingly under the control of the Minister and the Department of Education.  In themselves, they are not fundamental amendments and do not defy the Minister in any way.  The principle behind them, which is vitally important to the Bill, is whether we intend to ignore the vocational education committees and tell them that we are not interested in their opinions because it is the Minister's views which are important. The amendments would give a role to the vocational education committees in making proposals and recommendations &mdash; which the Minister need not accept. Otherwise, they will not have any role, the Minister will make a decision and will only have to consult vocational education committees.  He may ask for their opinion but if he does not like it he will go ahead with his own decision.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Education due to his sudden illness. I join in the good wishes for his speedy recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments are broadly in line with the Second Stage speech of the then Minister for Education and were circulated in response to the many valuable contributions made on Second Stage. However, I want to speak specifically to the amendment and I still feel that the power of decision in this matter should rest with the Minister, as provided for in the subsections, which make provision for consultation with the vocational education committee concerned and the governing body, as appropriate, before a decision is taken.  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 9 or 10 but I will certainly <Col N="1212" /> give serious consideration to any views expressed by a vocational education committee on bringing other institutions within the scope of the Bill in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It was remiss of me earlier not to wish the Minister for Education a speedy recovery, I do so now.</P>
      <P>The response of the Minister of State was disappointing because there is a vital issue at stake, that of initiation.  In these amendments we are seeking nothing more than the &ldquo;vocational education committee recommends&rdquo;.  We are talking about a recommendation from bodies who have developed the regional colleges to the level which they have reached at present and who know the local scene. Many people who have served for a long number of years on vocational education committees are very committed to the system and its expansion but, more important, their views emanate from their local knowledge and assessment of local needs.  The amendments provide for the committees being listened to and having a role in initiating examination within the Department of Education, that is all amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are seeking in relation to institution which may become part of colleges at a future date.  I strongly put to the Minister that this files in the face of subsidiarity.  As a marginal nation in the EC, on the periphery of Europe, subsidiarity is very important to us in terms of the Community. It is hypocritical &mdash; and a retrograde step from the point of view of the Department of Education &mdash; not to observe the principle of subsidiarity in the vital area of education.  &ldquo;Subsidiarity&rdquo; means that the decision-making powers are at local level or as close as possible to where decisions are made.  We do not even go that far in the amendment, we want recommendations to emanate &mdash; and to be welcomed &mdash; from vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the response of the Minister which will set the trend for the whole debate on Committee Stage.  I will have other opportunities to deal with that matter but when we talk in terms of recommendations from vocational education <Col N="1213" /> committees it is not asking a great deal that they be provided with the wherewithal to make those recommendations. This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave a brief reply in response to what was a lengthy presentation of the case in favour of these two amendments.  Brief and all as the Minister's response was it was also incorrect. He claimed that the position he has taken in tabling 43 amendments will drive the vocational education committees out of third level education and his opposition to these two amendments reflects the position taken by the then Minister when she introduced the Bill on Second Stage, but that is not the case. He also claimed that the amendments which have been tabled in the name of the Minister for Education and his opposition to the two amendments are a response to the contributions which were made in the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to take up both points. First, the then Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, so far as I can recall, did not make the case that the vocational education committees should be driven out of third level.  In fact, she argued strongly that the Bill as presented involved the retention of an important role for the vocational education committees in the regional technical colleges and, notwithstanding the reservations that had been expressed by Members on this side of the House, that there was no necessity to go any further than that.  She certainly did not make the case that the vocational education committees should be driven out of third level education which is what the Minister is now proposing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> Second, I now challenge the Minister to tell us who made the case in the House that the vocational education committees should be driven out of third level education. I do not recall any Member of this House making that case but I do recall Members on all sides of the House, including Members on the Minister's own side, making a strong case that the vocational education committees had an important role to play and should be kept in third level education.  Indeed, I recall Members on his side of the House making the argument that the Bill, as it stood, represented a concession to the principals of the regional technical colleges in their desire to get the vocational education committees off their backs.  I recall Members on his side of the House, some of whom have now been elevated to high office, making a forceful case that the role of the vocational education committees should be strengthened in the context of these Bills.</P>
    <P>Wherever the idea came from that the vocational education committees should be taken out of the regional technical colleges, it was not put forward in this House and is not in line with the policy that has been presented by the Minister or any of his predecessors up to now.  We are owed an explanation &mdash; since the Bill was debated in the House last December &mdash; as to where this idea that the vocational education committees should be taken out of third level education came from.  It is a new idea and it was not presented to the House on Second Stage last December.  We are owed an explanation as to where it came from because the Minister is wrong in stating that any of his predecessors presented that case or that it was made in this House.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has received the report from the Minister of State for Womens Affairs on the extent of the restrictions on abortion information such as censorship of imported magazines and newspapers, and withdrawal of women's health books from libraries which he promised at the all-party meeting with Oireachtas women Members on 25 February.</Quest>

      <P>Following the meeting which I and Minister of State Kitt had with women Deputies and Senators on 25 February 1992, I conveyed the concerns expressed at the meeting by the Oireachtas Members to the Government. Subsequently, the Government decided, on 10 March 1992, to establish a Cabinet subcommittee to consider the issues raised by the Deputy as well as other issues.  The Cabinet subcommittee are continuing their deliberations on this very complex issue and, as I have informed the House on numerous occasions, the Government will inform the House and the public in general as soon as the committee submit recommendations on all or even part of the issues which are pertinent to their remit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Would the Taoiseach not accept that the issue of information on abortion is now a sick joke, given the fact <Col N="1219" /> that the Official Report of Thursday last, 28 May 1992, contains the full text of the Marie Stopes advertisement with the relevant telephone numbers and can be purchased at the Government Publications Office for £1.50?  Given the fact that the Official Report can be legally bought and distributed, indeed given to all the family planning clinics, would the Taoiseach not accept that this makes a total laughing stock of Dáil Éireann?</P>

Perhaps the Deputy should direct her energy in that direction.  I have explained the position from the Government's point of view and the steps we have taken to resolve it.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider having the State injunction withdrawn, given the expressed views of the judges and their judgment in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case?  Would it not be prudent, given the difficulties that women are facing, to lift these restrictions and enable information on abortion to be circulated, as it now can be done when one buys a copy of the Official Report of Thursday last?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined to the House and to the Deputy the Government's position and said that the matter will be dealt with later this year.  The Deputy seems to want to side step the fact that the decision in this case was taken by members of Dublin Corporation who voted on the matter and I am not sure if members of her own party participated in that vote.</P>

      <P>The matters which were discussed at my meeting with the political correspondents on 21 May 1992 covered various topics of current interest. The newspaper reports in regard to the statement on legislation on homosexuality, referred to in the question, by <Col N="1222" /> the Irish Ambassador to the Council of Europe were incorrect in that his statement was not made to the Court of Human Rights but to a Council of Europe meeting of the Committee of Minister's Deputies on Human Rights.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the Government's record of compliance with decisions of the European Court of Human Rights is deplorable and that the various specific promises that have been made by Government Ministers have not been kept?  In late 1990 the then Minister for Justice promised that we would have legislation on this matter before this House by late 1991.  Will the Taoiseach state if such legislation will be brought before the House by the end of 1992? Will he comment also on his reported statements that the ambassador concerned was not speaking on behalf of the Government when he indicated the legislation would be dealt with by the end of this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will reply to the latter part of the Deputy's question.  The ambassador concerned said that the legislation is &ldquo;included in the Government's legislative programme for 1992.&rdquo; The ambassador, on the basis of the information given to him by the Department of Justice in the earlier part of May, was following exactly the information available to him.</P>
      <P>Of course, it is open to Government to establish their own priorities, and we changed our priorities after that date. The ambassador was quite in order in what he said.  However, I have said here, and I will now repeat what I said last week, the Government's legislative position is that this legislation will not be before this House before the end of this year.</P>

Will the Taoiseach <Col N="1223" /> indicate when he expects the legislation to be brought before this House and will he also indicate how far advanced the legislation is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated on numerous occasions in this House that such legislation is included in the Programme for Government and will take its place in the queue of priorities that the Government have already set.  It will not be proceeded with this year, as I have already said.  I have already listed the legislation that we want to seen from the Department of Justice this year; but this legislation is down the line in the queue, as I have already stated quite clearly.</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to add to that. It appears the Deputy wants instant solutions to all the problems in the area of social legislation and may I remind him that we are just over 100 days in Government.</P>

      <Quest>the number of occasions on which the task force on employment, established under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, have met; the number of reports they have produced so far; the progress which has been made in implementing these reports; if he will outline the proposed future work of the task force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force on <Col N="1226" /> employment have met on 33 occasions since they were established in June 1991. They have submitted 15 reports to Government.  These reports related to the production of components and products for multinational companies; extra third level places in education; new in-company job training scheme; stamp duty on new houses; planning procedures; the special trading houses scheme; the European orientation programme; Revenue Statistics on Employment; urban renewal; roads construction; labour force statistics; investment and reorganisation of the ports; telecommunications tariffs; direct marketing and expansion of the VTOS scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, the task force developed and submitted to Government measures aimed at helping to get long term unemployed persons back to work in the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area partnerships which I announced at the presentation of the 1991 annual report of the Tallaght Partnership on 30 April 1992.  These measures had been submitted to the task force on behalf of the partnerships.</P>
      <P>A large number of the recommendations made by the task force are being implemented.  A working party set up under the task force have launched a major initiative involving the IDA and the chief executives of the multinational companies to double the purchasing of Irish-made components by the electronics industry with the objective of increasing this business to £600 million a year within the next five years with the possibility of creating more than 3,000 jobs.  They are also working to maximise the use of Irish-sourced products in the construction industry.  A further working group are promoting linkages between State companies and have recently developed a strategy for the development of the Irish building products industry which will, through the appropriate agencies, develop linkages within the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the task force recommendations on the requirement for extra places in third level education there will be an estimated additional 4,200 places <Col N="1227" /> in 1992-93 in the public institutions while some private third level colleges have had certain courses approved for the higher education grants scheme as a result of their being accepted as designated institutions.</P>
    <P>The new employment subsidy scheme and job training scheme, which are now operational, were established on the basis of recommendations made by the task force.  Up to 29 May applications were made by companies in respect of 3,699 jobs under the scheme, with a total of 3,188 job approvals.  The approval process in respect of applications for placement on the job training scheme is also in operation and recruitment has commenced under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The task force had recommended that the threshold for the exemption from stamp duty for the sale of new houses be increased from a floor-area of 125m² to 140m².  This proposal was given due consideration in the context of the 1992 budget but was not approved by Government. A study of the special trading houses scheme which was recommended by the task force is underway and will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Task force recommendations on planning procedures expedited the release of planning permissions for 11,000 houses in September 1991.  Recommendations regarding the period of decision by An Bord Pleanála have been taken into account in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991, currently before the Seanad, and similar requirements will be applied to the licensing provisions in the Environment Protection Agency Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the European Orientation Programme as recommended by the task force is proceeding apace playing a vital role in giving specialised training for young Irish graduates in marketing skills in Europe.</P>
    <P>It was also recommended by the task force that there should be a much higher proportion of residential development in the urban renewal areas and that incentives to encourage this should be developed.  Section 23 incentives are now <Col N="1228" /> confined to the designated areas.  The task force have made recommendations relating to the National Roads Authority which are being considered by the Department of the Environment in the context of the Roads Bill, 1991.</P>
    <P>On foot of the task force recommendations on the improvement of statistics on employment and unemployment the Revenue Commissioners are developing a computerised system to allow for quarterly reports of the numbers of individuals in employment. The Department of Social Welfare are also carrying out the classification of live register inflows by previous history and occupation in the 51 employment exchanges across the country. From the end of May, the coverage of the live register will be changed in accordance with recommendations of an expert group, representative of relevant Government Departments, the Central Statistics Office and the social partners, endorsed by the task force.  Persons on short-time working arrangements currently on the live register who have a strong job attachment for 50 per cent or more of a given period will be included with other systematic short-time workers in Table 5 of the monthly live register statement.  Certain self-employed persons, such as small shopkeepers and fishermen who are in receipt of unemployment assistance as an income supplement will be removed from the live register as they are analogous to the unemployment assistance of smallholders. The method of compiling the unemployment rate in Table 7 of the monthly live register statement will be changed to accord with that used by agencies such as OECD and EUROSTAT in their monthly publications.</P>
    <P>Recent task force recommendations have dealt with investment and re-organisation of Irish ports; the need for more competitive international telecommunication tariffs; the growth potential of the direct marketing industry and the need to improve employment prospects of the long term unemployed by raising their education level.  These are at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> The work of the task force is ongoing having regard to the work being undertaken in other fora such as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment, the task force on the implementation of the report of the industrial policy review group, the task force on tourism and the 12 area partnership companies and they will continue to make recommendations on initiatives to increase employment and reduce unemployment.</P>

Will he indicate the relationship which will exist between the Task Force and the new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment?</P>

      <P>The new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment will have at their disposal all the information available in various areas of Government. They will also interact with the Task Force on Employment.  The Deputy sought specific details on all the schemes being operated.  I do not have this information with me but if the Deputy puts down a separate question I have not doubt that the information can be extracted for him.</P>

      <P>I would have thought, given the nature of the Taoiseach's reply, that one simple fact that would have been highlighted if it existed at all would be the figure of net jobs created as a result of the recommendations of the task force.  Could the Taoiseach be more specific with regards to the rôle of the task force <i>vis-á-vis</i> the new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment and does he think there will be duplication of effort in relation to these two bodies?</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach does not have the global figure on the number of jobs created, if any, may I ask him a question in relation to the first proposal made by the task force on the sourcing of goods for multinationals in Ireland?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts down a question on that matter I shall be glad to answer it.  I would remind him that he is talking about the linkage programme. One of the task force reports set a target of 3,000 jobs to be achieved over a period of five years in the electronics areas alone.  The importation into this country of goods valued between £800 million and £1,000 million represents a substantial number of jobs that could be created here.  In relation to the multinational investment referred to by the Deputy, the Irish economy supplies only about 27 per cent of the total requirements of the multinationals in this country.  Consequently, this is another area that needs to be focused in on to try to create the maximum number of jobs. This is one of the reasons that economic growth of the levels achieved over the last four years has not produced the additional number of jobs expected.</P>

      <P>The Government have welcomed the statement of the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference on the Maastricht referendum.  In our response, we welcomed in particular the reminder that the Catholic Church both in Ireland and Europe has always supported greater European unity, a point also conveyed in the formal message from the Synod of Bishops in Rome last December to the European Heads of State and Government meeting in Maastricht.</P>
      <P>The Government also welcomed the recognition in the statement of the positive value of the declaration obtained by the Government from their EC partners, and that both Article 40.3.3 and the Protocol, even following the Supreme Court judgment, still provide a degree of protection to the right to life of the unborn.</P>
      <P>The Government statement went on to reiterate that we fully accept that the substantive issue of abortion as well as the question of travel and information must be addressed, and that we are committed to doing so later in the year.  We also pointed out that it is clear from the Bishops' statement that they see no particular advantage in rejecting the European Union Treaty on 18 June from the point of view of protecting the unborn. Finally, the Government noted that the Bishops' statement recognises many of the practical difficulties and complexities of the situation and that they do not equate ratification of the Treaty with abortion.</P>

The text was circulated to Departments.  A final consideration in the light of those observations is underway; 2.  The drafting of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill has been completed and will shortly be considered by the Attorney General prior to submission to Government; and 3.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 11, Oral Questions Nos. 15, 22, 24, 28, 35 and Written Question No. 49 together.</P>
      <P>The Culliton report made recommendations for a reformed industrial policy and for changes over a wide area of public policy.  The Government, when they considered the report last January, accepted its thrust and established a task force to facilitate the implementation of the Culliton recommendations and to achieve the necessary change of focus across a broad range of policy areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Moriarty Task Force has recently submitted a first report which I will be putting forward for decision at Government shortly.  Their second report covering the remaining issues will, I <Col N="1241" /> understand, be available within a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate to discuss the contents of the report of the Moriarty Task Force until they have been considered by Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured, however, that the extensive changes in policies and measures that are called for will get the speedy and decisive attention of the Government.  Announcements will of course be made then, as is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Deputies are correct when they identify the development of industry and particularly of indigenous industry as a key concern of the Joint Programme for Government.  It was, likewise, a primary concern of the Culliton group in their review of industrial policy.  That group made their recommendations for change on the basis that a new concentration is needed on the upgrading of indigenous industry.  They saw improvements in indigenous industry's performance and growth as contingent on changes in education, training, energy, infrastructure, communications, taxation, policy for State trading companies as well as in programmes for industry.</P>
    <P>They appointed out that there are no quick fixes.  But if the new policies that they recommended and in particular the new concentration on self-reliance and enterprise in indigenous industry and on its development, upgrading and growth were implemented, then improved net jobs growth could be attained.  They projected, as a result of changed policies taking effect, a net increase of up to 10,000 jobs per annum on average from industry and private services.  This level would be an improvement on what is now attainable.</P>
    <P>An improvement on that level of employment increase will depend in the short run on factors such as our competitive structures and the state of our markets abroad.  In the medium term, implementation of the Culliton approach will give the better, more sustainable growth to which we aspire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to indigenous industry.  Would the Minister <Col N="1242" /> define what he means by that?  Is it Irish owned and located here or merely industry located in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean Irish owned industry primarily, but there is an extended definition under consideration which will include controlled from Ireland, irrespective of the ownership.  In present circumstances it is probably not unreasonable to accept that as a definition of &ldquo;indigenous Irish industry&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that that definition is out of date?  The Minister should invent a new word for industries located here, managed here and with the capability of expanding here regardless of where they are owned or from where they are controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A distinction has to be made between the exercise of control here and the exercise of control from abroad.  The distinction, in the European context particularly, is becoming less relevant, or less clearcut than it was in the past.  Nonetheless, it is a valid distinction to make and it is easy to recognise that there are significant differences at the moment.  The greater weakness is clearly on the indigenous side and it is one to which Culliton and various other commentators have drawn attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the example of two firms manufacturing the same product, one controlled from Germany and the other Irish-owned and controlled. They both apply for a grant to the IDA. The Irish-owned and controlled company will not get a grant but the German-controlled company will get a grant. Surely that is a recommendation from Culliton that the Minister will reject, despite what we have read in the papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Deputy comes up with that example, saying that in those circumstances the Irish-owned operation will not get a grant <Col N="1243" /> and that the German-owned operation will.  They will be treated equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the question of equity, not grants.  Culliton has drawn attention to the fact that in his opinion it can be desirable in appropriate cases that part of the package of assistance offered by the State would include some equity.  He does not think that would apply in the case of non-indigenous companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important point which is causing great confusion.  It appears that Culliton recommends that Irish companies doing exactly the same job will be treated differently from foreign companies.  Equity and grants are not the same.  Equity by definition involves a cost to the company, whereas grants are free.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not extremely disappointed that the essential statistics are only available to 1988-89 and that, notwithstanding the apparent increase he indicates in the level of investment, the net number of jobs being provided in manufacturing industry is falling?  Has the Minister examined that aspect and is he suggesting any radical alterations to the policy that has produced those very unsatisfactory results?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I should like more recent figures if they were available, but they are not available from the CSO in respect of this heading after 1989. The Deputy is wrong in saying that manufacturing employment is falling.  On the contrary, particularly since 1988, it has been increasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That increase would not have been achieved were it not for, among other things, the level of capital investment being made, which has been increased in a particularly marked way from 1988 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the investment of increasingly large amounts of money up to 1989 is not fulfilling the need to provide anything like the necessary level of employment?  Does the Minister have any radical new proposals to reverse the position in the public, <Col N="1245" /> private or semi-State sector?  If so, what is this new thinking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the Deputy seek to convey that manufacturing employment in Ireland is in a serious state by comparison with other western European countries, I should like to give him some statistics covering the past 20 years to show the reality.  Manufacturing employment in Ireland in the period 1970 to 1990 declined by 2.2 per cent.  The corresponding figure for the same period in other countries in the Community is as follows: Germany, a decline of 15.2 per cent; United Kingdom, a decline of 38.2 per cent; Denmark, a decline of 17.4 per cent; France, a decline of 16.9 per cent; and Italy, a decline of 11.3 per cent.  In terms of the retention of manufacturing employment Ireland has been more successful than any other Western European country.  Even though there has been a very marginal decline in the 21-year period, the quality of the jobs that existed in 1990 in manufacturing in Ireland by comparison with the quality of the jobs that existed in 1970 was immeasurably better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the key factor is not the quality of the jobs but the absence of jobs for 300,000 people who are seeking them? Would the Minister not agree that the only key statistic which is relevant is the fact that the unemployment level in this country is 20 per cent while in each of the other countries enumerated it might average out at between 6 per cent and 8 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that would indicate is that increases in employment tend in a modern economy to come not directly from manufacturing but from a much broader range of services. That is where the pick-up in employment will take place here.  It will be underpinned by our successful manufacturing economy which has held its own remarkably well in very difficult circumstances and which creates more spinoff <Col N="1246" /> employment than any other sector of the economy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>My Department do not maintain a register of the type referred to by the Deputy nor do I consider it necessary that they should do so or publish a list of all of the interests of persons appointed to the boards of State companies.</P>
      <P>Following Government consideration of the matter, guidelines have been prepared by the Minister for Finance on the governance of State bodies.  I have written to the chairman of each of the semi-State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department enclosing a copy of these guidelines and requesting that they be given immediate implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the guidelines all appointees to the boards of State bodies are required to furnish details of all their business interests to the secretary to the body.  It is a matter for the board of each State <Col N="1247" /> body to ensure that these arrangements are adhered to and that no conflict of interests arises.  The guidelines do not require the publication of declared interests.</P>
    <P>The persons appointed by me to boards of State bodies under the aegis of my Department since 18 October 1991 are as follows:</P>
    <P>Industrial Development Authority: Mr. Paul Kavanagh, Mr. Denis Murphy, Ms. Frances Ruane and Mr. Eugene Greene (whose appointment takes effect on 1 July next).</P>
    <P>Irish Steel Limited: Mr. Dermot Quirke, Mr. Patrick Howard, Mr. Des Wall, Mr. Bob Rutledge, Mr. Liam Coughlan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister arrange to have the person who prepares his replies available to the Taoiseach?  There is a commendable presence of statistics in the Minister's replies, while they are not available from the Taoiseach.  Am I correct in saying that the Minister said these are not public documents?  I would have thought the objective of the exercise was to have some transparency in appointments to State boards.  It is desirable at some stage or in some place that these lists of people and their interests be made available to the public so that they can check them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines are public but the declarations of interest which have to be furnished to the secretary of the board concerned are not being made public.  I do not think it is necessary or desirable that that should be so.  It is a matter for the chairman, the chief executive and the secretary, to each of whom this information is made available, to ensure in conjunction with the board member, on whom there is the primary responsibility, that no conflict of interest arises.  I believe the guidelines now set out are sufficiently clear to ensure, with the co-operation of all parties, <Col N="1248" /> that difficulties of this kind will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is at least odd that in the case of members of local authorities, who have to declare their interests, these declarations of interest are made available to the public for inspection, whereas the interests of Government appointees to State boards are not made public?  Boards of State companies may not be fully aware of all the potential conflicts of interest between Ministers' appointees and the interests of the board itself.  A public perusal of their interests may bring to light things that should have been included but which were not included.  I do not think there is much point in the whole exercise if the records are not available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy on that point.  Making declarations of interest available to the company in the circumstances which I have outlined will ensure that a conflict of interest does not arise, in so far as that is humanly possible.  If somebody sets out to operate in an improper way he will probably be able to get away with it, at least in the short term, if he is sufficiently determined.  Assuming normal co-operation, which I would assume, these safeguards are adequate.  Publishing willy nilly all the business interests of everybody who serves on a State board &mdash; even interests which are not relevant to the board &mdash; would have the effect of causing worthwhile appointees to decline appointment because their private affairs would be canvassed publicly to no great public purpose.</P>

      <P>When I nominated the person in question for appointment as an inspector I was not aware of any reason which would have precluded him from being so appointed by the High Court.  Clearly, the High Court which appointed him also had no reason to doubt his professional competence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept it was difficult for one of the High Court inspectors to produce a short report into the affairs of Greencore in view of his financial difficulties, which have been confirmed?  The fact that the Minister and the Government accepted that those inspectors be paid at the daily rate of £1,750, plus expenses, and in view of this information there would be no incentive for any inspector to produce a short report?  Would the Minister further accept that one of the High Court inspectors received a letter from the Government confirming the level of fees in order to produce it to financial institutions as collateral?  Finally, in view of this information <Col N="1251" /> would he accept that he did not check out thoroughly the appointment of this inspector and that he made a grave mistake in that appointment subsequently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a very large number of supplementary questions and I am not sure I can remember them all.  To suggest that because somebody is paid on a daily basis he wants to prolong the matter as long as possible is unfair.  That allegation was contained in the question as originally submitted but was deleted by the Ceann Comhairle as being an improper imputation. If you want to make that imputation you could make it against any lawyer in any court case because he is being paid, in addition to a brief fee, a daily refresher fee also.  Any professional person's obligations are that he finish the task on which he is engaged as expeditiously as possible, consonant with his duty to do a good job.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to make a detailed personal check on the affairs of everybody who might be appointed to any particular post.  If somebody holds membership of a particular institute of society a Minister, or indeed any other citizen, is entitled to assume that that person by virtue of his membership of that institute complies with what one would call the normal professional requirements.  In the case of the two inspectors, one was a senior counsel and the other was a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.  It seemed to me that their professional qualifications were more than adequate for the job concerned and that appears to have been borne out as the view of the High Court also who appointed them quite readily.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the fact that on the Saturday night after the issue of interference with the inspector mentioned in this question and after a discussion took place in this House, a very senior member of the Minister's own party paid a visit to the inspector's home and applied pressure to him in relation to certain matters?  Is the Minister aware that that happened and would he condone such conduct by a senior member of this own party?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should point out that I am not answerable to this House for the actions of anybody other than myself, and I do not think that a question like that is properly put in this House. <Col N="1253" /> However, lest the insinuation or innuendo in the question go unanswered, and without prejudice to what I believe to be the proper legal and parliamentary position in regard to it, I would say that it was made abundantly clear in a report which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday last that the person to whom the Deputy refers was asked by the gentleman who is the subject of these questions to visit him in his professional capacity for the purpose of advising him in regard to certain legal problems which had arisen for him.  The person to whom the Deputy refers complied with that request in his professional capacity and offered such advice as, to him, seemed appropriate.  I think it was perfectly proper for him to do so, and to suggest in any way that there is any impropriety in his doing so is, in my view, quite wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that he denies absolutely any suggestion that the prominent member of his party concerned was acting as a go-between between himself and the former inspector?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as has been made quite clear publicly by the man concerned, is that he was consulted in a professional capacity and he attended on the inspector in question at that inspector's request for the purpose of affording such legal advice as was asked of him.  I am not aware that he attended in any other capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the person we are referring to, a member of his party, was very concerned that the High Court inspector involved would not actually seek to clarify the presence of notes and logs which would <Col N="1254" /> have embroiled the Minister in some controversy as a result of an article that appeared in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on 8 March about alleged interference by the Minister into the conduct of the Greencore inquiry?  Does the Minister intend to pursue those legal proceedings at the earliest opportunity in view of the fact that he was clearly annoyed that his integrity was impugned at the time? When will he take the first opportunity to clear his name?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking to take every opportunity.  I do not believe that my name needs clearing.  I have been the subject of persistent attacks of a personal nature over a period of several months now in every issue of a certain newspaper, obviously for some particular purpose connected, I think, with another event.  I deplore the fact that I am subjected continually to these attacks week after week but I do not believe that those who carry on this or who inspire it will achieve their objectives, nor will they deflect me from what I see as my duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he, as a qualified lawyer, must be well aware of the longstanding precedent in the legal profession that senior counsel, or indeed junior counsel, would not attend upon a client without an accompanying solicitor or, indeed, in the absence of a request from a solicitor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to make a complaint to the Bar Council about that matter, I am sure he knows the manner in which he can do it but if he thinks, at the same time, that every member of the Bar speaks to a member of the public only in the presence of a solicitor then the Deputy is being somewhat naive and I do not think the world would work very effectively if that were done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The study to which the Deputies refer was undertaken within my Department as part of an ongoing evaluation of the industrial development process.  The study examined the grant support paid to, and the job performance of, Irish-owned and foreign-owned industry over the period 1981 to 1990.  The study was made available to the members of the Industrial Policy Review Group who drew on its findings and referred specifically to it in their own report &mdash; the Culliton report.</P>
      <P>The analysis undertaken in the study shows that the net change in employment from end 1980 to end 1990 in firms which were grant-aided by IDA and SFADCo in the 1981-1990 period was about 7,000 jobs.  The amount paid in industrial grants to these firms in the 1981-1990 period was £1.6 billion approximately in 1990 prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures clearly raise questions about the various programmes for industrial promotion which existed in the period.  Some of those programmes, such as re-equipment grants for industry, even in cases where employment was being <Col N="1256" /> reduced, existed in the earlier part of the eighties but subsequently ceased.</P>
    <P>In publishing my Department's Review of Industrial Performance over a year ago I said in the Preface to the Review:</P>
    <P>it is clear that a poor correlation exists between State expenditure (direct and tax-related) on industry and net employment creation.  State expenditure on industrial incentives is clearly not the determining factor.  Net change in manufacturing employment depends on demand conditions and domestic and export markets, on the cost of capital and on the ability and willingness of Irish-based industrial firms to compete effectively on these markets.  These factors are in turn partly dependent on the Government's fiscal stance, its taxation policies and on the consensus approach by the social partners to national recovery.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that the employment performance of medium/large indigenous industry was particularly disappointing over the past 20 years.  I said that:</P>
    <P>In the three years of the Review period employment in the sector fell by more than 9,000 despite the input of tens of millions of pounds in State expenditure.  The performance of the sector raises serious questions about effectiveness of the instruments used in pursuit of the development of the sector.</P>
    <P>I also said that there is a &ldquo;need to ensure a value for money assessment system, relating expenditure to objectives and performance, is in place for each promotional measure operated by the industrial development bodies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The study to which the Deputies refer is part of the assessment system to which I then referred and which is being put in place by my Department.  Its findings will be fully taken into account in the reform of industrial policy that will follow from the report and recommendations of the Culliton Group which, as I have indicated, had full access to the study report and its findings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> The figure of £4.58 billion, mentioned by Deputy Gilmore, is not contained in the study report.  This amount, which was quoted in a recent press article, appears to include, in addition to the cost of grants, an estimate of the cost of tax reliefs for industry.  That estimate of tax expenditure appears to relate not only to the manufacturing firms grant-aided in the 1981-1990 period and included in my Department's studies but to the wider industrial sector also.</P>
    <P>Neither is the cost per job figure of £228,000, quoted by Deputy Gilmore, contained in the study report.  It would be misleading and an oversimplification to derive cost-per-job figures by simply dividing the gross expenditure on grants over a period, such as the eighties, by the net job change over the same period by the firms which got those grants.  Such an approach would not, for example, take account of the fact that in the eighties many jobs that had previously been carried out by the direct employees of grant-aided industrial firms were increasingly sub-contracted to external non-manufacturing firms in areas such as maintenance, transportation, distribution and so on.  Many of these sub-contracting firms were established by former employees of the grant-aided industrial firms from which they received work.  I would also ignore the fact that grant-assisted jobs were created in firms during the years 1981-1990 but not sustained until the end of 1990.  Finally, such an approach would also fail to take account of the substantial indirect employment created more widely in the economy as a result of the direct and indirect expenditure by grant-aided industrial firms in purchasing goods and services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has acknowledged that poor correlation exists between expenditure and performance on job creation and in view of his comments about the method used to calculate the net cost per job, would he arrange for the publication of the full study carried out by the officer in the planning unit of his Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to publishing the main report, I have already published 16 of the reports prepared for the Culliton review group, an unprecedented move.  I am not aware that 16, frequently very substantial, back-up papers have ever been published with a report of this kind.  Therefore, I do not propose to publish any further documentation. In particular, it would be inappropriate to publish the study to which the Deputy refers, as that was a study from one of the back-up papers that has been published.  That study was not drawn up with a view to publication. It is unnecessary to publish the study and publication could be somewhat misleading in that the study considers the position from one narrow perspective only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Miniser's commitment to open government. However, I put it to him that this study, which shows that an enormous amount of public money &mdash; £1.6 billion over ten years &mdash; was spent with a very poor return to the State in terms of employment creation, should be published so that the public can know the full extent to which taxpayers' money is being spent on job creation and the poor performance arising out of that.  Why is the Minister declining to publish the report in view of the fact that he has already published 16 studies?</P>

I might add that not only are the figures quoted by the Deputy not included in this study but they are also <Col N="1259" /> not included in Culliton's own references or comments.  It is not necessary for me to publish any more than the 16 very extensive papers that I have already published which, I believe, is without precedent.</P>

Is it not the case that the revised figure of £1.6 billion shows that there has been something rotten in the expenditure/job creation relationship in this country?  Will the Minister make the study available to the task force on the Culliton report?  I suggest that that study is very relevant to those who are seeking to supervise and implement the proposals of the Cullition report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only classify the Minister's reply as a non-answer because he has not told us anything which we had not known already from statements in recent days.  Will the Minister state whether the cucumbers in question have been infected externally or internally? Was it due to sprays, pesticides or something genetic within the vegetable?  Is it confined to Irish cucumbers, which was insinuated, is it a combination of Irish and foreign cucumbers or is it one or the other?  We would all like to know whether the growers will be compensated for something over which they had no control but which seriously affects their livelihoods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as concerned as any Deputy in the House in relation to the threat to the livelihoods of the cucumber producers.  Since this problem was first raised I have been in very close contact with officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food and, through them, the Department of Health, for the purpose of identifying the toxin involved in regard to this problem.  I am also concerned about the health factor involved and I sympathise with the people who suffered illness as a result of eating these cucumbers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has patience I will answer his question in detail. A wide range of tests has been carried out but the earlier tests were totally negative. We carried out tests on a range of approximately 70 chemicals involved in the treatment of horticultural products; all these tests proved negative.  This morning officials of the Department embarked on an intensified campaign to try to pinpoint the chemical &mdash; if a chemical is involved.  From inquiries which I made a short time ago there is an indication that we are making positive progress in relation to identifying the source. It would appear &mdash; although it is not conclusive &mdash; that the problem arose as a result perhaps of chemicals being used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his efforts in relation to this terrible problem facing the Irish growers, for his co-operation and for the efforts made by the officials of his Department. I am glad that progress is being made in regard to the tests and that there is a chance of being able to pinpoint the source of the problem.  Will the Minister ensure that the same tests are carried out on the imported cucumber as those which were done on the Irish, because the first statement by the chairman of the Food Safety Advisory Committee was a blanket statement in relation to Irish products only and did not refer to imported cucumbers? This has created terrible problems for the Irish industry.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of compensation, does the Minister realise in regard to this £1 million home industry that some growers depend on the cucumber crop for up to 90 per cent of their annual income and that they need to know now that a fair compensation scheme will be available to them?  Some of these people are losing up to £5,000 per week per acre of glass.  Will the Minister consider that it is not sufficient to apply compensation just on the losses at present, because until the market recovers, which could be some considerable time, the growers will continue to lose money?  It is vitally important that the growers know that a compensation scheme will be available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a <Col N="1265" /> number of questions.  In an effort to bring about a speedy resolution of this problem, Department officials, in co-operation with the Department of Health, embarked on a 50 per cent random sampling very soon after this matter was raised.  Since then they have completed a total test on all producers' cucumbers &mdash; in other words, they visited all the producers and have taken samples from the horticultural projects involved.  I requested officials of the Department to also carry out checks in relation to imported cucumbers for the purpose of trying to establish the source of the problem. The Deputy will appreciate that it is extremely difficult to embark on a compaign of testing all imported cucumbers. However, as we want to try to have some cross-checking in relation to home-produced cucumbers as against imports, we have arranged to have these tests carried out.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about the supervision of the disposal of contaminated cucumbers.  I fully agree with his point about the importance of supervised disposal, because unless we supervise the disposals of contaminated cucumbers customers will never be totally satisfied that the problem has been resolved.  Therefore, in consultation with my Department officials, we have arranged for supervised disposal of contaminated produce.  As I indicated in my earlier reply, I am not in a position to give any kind of positive assurances in relation to the question of compensation. However, I have arranged to meet tomorrow morning representatives of the producer groups involved and I will be discussing with them the question of compensation. Therefore, it would not be reasonable or fair to expect me to give a categoric assurance at Question Time in relation to compensation.  The matter will not be resolved here.  When I meet the producer groups I will listen to the case they will make, but I cannot give a definite assurance in relation to it.</P>

I should say in fairness to Irish producers that following the scare they have refrained from marketing their produce.  This is an indication that they have adopted a reasonable approach.  They are co-operating fully with officials of my Department and the Department of Health.  I hope the matter <Col N="1267" /> can be disposed of quickly, that the status of Irish cucumbers can be restored and that Irish producers can rely on the quality of their produce.  As I indicated in my earlier reply, once the matter has been disposed, of An Bord Glas, the official agency who promote the horticulture industry, will embark on a campaign to re-establish the credibility of the Irish cucumber industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to compliment the Minister of State and his officials for paying attention to this matter over the bank holiday weekend.  Given that we are now almost two weeks into this crisis, growers will be very uneasy and disappointed that the source of the problem has not yet been identified, be it home produced or imported cucumbers. Indeed.  We do not know whether the cucumber is the source of the problem at all.  Given that the livelihoods of many growers and their families are at stake &mdash; up to 60 staff are directly involved &mdash; I ask the Minister of State to give a specific commitment that he will agree in principle to provide compensation for these people as nothing less will satisfy them. There are precedents in other areas of agriculture for making such payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any precedent where a Minister gave an assurance in this House at Question Time to provide compensation.  All I am saying is that tomorrow morning I am due to meet representatives of the producers and I will listen attentively to what they will have to say in relation to the case for compensation.  Coming as I do from an agricultural background, I can appreciate their problems.  Many of them are small producers who rely on the cucumber industry for their livelihood.  While I am not going to say anything positive or definite in reply to the Deputy's question I will approach the matter with an open mind and will listen to the case that will be made by the representatives of the producers and make a decision later in consultation with my senior colleague, <Col N="1268" /> the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh.</P>

I thank him for his positive reply on all other aspects in relation to An Bord Glas and others but with regard to compensation, while I accept that the Minister of State is not going to give us a positive response today, I wish to restate that the cucumber industry is the main source of income for some 60 people involved and that they badly need to be compensated.  I trust that the Minister for State will take a positive approach to this matter.  Finally, may I ask him if he will ensure that the doctor who made the initial statement, the Chairman of the Food Safety Advisory Committee, will make another statement to clarify the situation once the health scare is over in order to allay public fears so that once again we can have a thriving cucumber industry?  Given that he made the initial statement, he must make another statement.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I should like to make it perfectly clear that the Government will be going ahead with the referendum here on 18 June on the European Union Treaty.  This we are obliged to do in the proper discharge of our international responsibilities and the provision contained in Article R that all member states will have the Treaty ratified in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements and will deposit the instrument of ratification with the Government of Italy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> The Treaty provides that it shall come into force on 1 January 1993 provided that all the instruments of ratification are deposited.</P>
    <P>The Government deeply regret the decision of the Danish people in yesterday's referendum to reject the European Union Treaty.  As the House will be aware, this result was on the basis of a very narrow margin, by less than 50,000 votes out of a total electorate of 3.9 million people.  The situation created by this result is, of course, a Danish problem in the first instance, and I understand the Danish Government are meeting today to assess the position.</P>
    <P>The predictable negative reactions in Danish economic and financial circles are already in evidence, with heavy activity on the Danish stock market, where shares have fallen, the value of bonds has declined and the value of the Danish Kroner has also fallen.  I am told also that there have been increases in interest rates and that there is also selling of investment funds out of the Danish market.  These are but the immediate first-round effects of the Danish decision.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the repercussions of the Danish decision that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in Ireland does not mean that nothing changes.  A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote does have serious economic consequences, even for a more highly developed economy than ours as the Danish decision has shown.  Our essential national interests have not changed overnight because of the Danish result.  Our case for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is as strong today and as compelling as it ever was.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented situation created by this result now requires urgent consultations at EC level, in which this country will fully participate.  Already this morning the European Commission assessed the situation, and President Delors issued a statement at lunch-time today.  In this statement, the Commission notes that, while respecting the democratic will of the Danish people, the Commission reaffirms the vital importance of the European Union Treaty, and that this Treaty represents and indispensable <Col N="1356" /> qualitative step to enable the community to confront the challenges at world level and discharge its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The consequnce of the Danish &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, the Commission notes, is not only for the Community but also for Denmark and its people.  I would draw the attention of the House particularly to the Commission's hope that the other member states will proceed with their own ratification procedures within the deadlines provided for.</P>
    <P>EC Foreign Ministers will meet in emergency session in Oslo tomorrow. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. David Andrews, will be attending this meeting.  We will, of course, ensure the House and the people at large will be fully informed on the outcome of this meeting.</P>
    <P>It would not, of course, be appropriate for me to comment or speculate on the reason for the Danish result.  Their economy and their concerns are different from ours.  The reasons for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in our case are clearly in evidence, with the overwhelming endorsement given by this House and the Seanad recently, as well as by the full spectrum of economic and commercial interests including employers, trade unions and farming bodies.  The Irish Farmers' Association, the Federation of Irish Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and other organisations have all indicated their support for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>While these are speaking as representative bodies and urging a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, they are even more vitally speaking for those they represent, as people and as individuals.  Do those who advocate a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote here tell us how we would cope with the sort of pressures which have hit Denmark today?  Could we as an even smaller and less wealthy economy withstand the outflow of investment funds which would follow?  Could our employers, farmers and trade union members bear the significantly higher interest rates which, as the Danish experience is showing, are a consequence of staying outside the process of European <Col N="1357" /> integration?  Could we really bear the still higher unemployment which would inevitably follow those higher interest rates and the more difficult climate for investment?</P>
    <P>We have the extraordinary position that those who argue most strongly for Irish sovereignty are now arguing that because another country in the Community takes a certain line we, in full exercise of that sovereignty, should also take that line: that argument just does not stand up.  Danish interests are not Irish interests; Irish concerns are not Danish concerns.  The two issues are totally separate.</P>
    <P>But what is not separate and distinct is the issue of European integration.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise sufficiently that a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; will be important here to enhance our standing in Europe and strengthen our position in EC negotiating fora.  The European Union Treaty, and our full participation in it, will provide major benefits for us, such as a boost to economic growth, more jobs, narrowing of disparities in living standards, improvements in workers' and women's rights, protection of the environment, as well as strengthening the Community's its role as a core of stability in Europe and its role as a force for peace, justice and the alleviation of hunger throughout the world.</P>
    <P>In fact, this is a point which is all too often overlooked in the continuing debate on Maastricht.  The European Community was established to end war in Europe and bring peace among the nations there, which had twice in a generation devastated the continent and the larger world outside it.  This was to be achieved by trading together and working together.  That is the process Europe has followed consistently since the Rome Treaty was signed more than 30 years ago now.</P>
    <P>But developments over that period have shown the need for a union which is more than just a trading bloc with some added provisions for co-operation in political matters.  The Danish vote has not changed the need for European integration or the objectives agreed by the <Col N="1358" /> member states of the Community at Maastricht.  We still need not only to strengthen the bonds that bind the nations of the Community together and so make the conflicts of the past absolutely unthinkable; it is necessary to ensure the peace of Europe in the world and to guarantee its people the stability and comparative prosperity they have enjoyed over the period of the Community's existence.</P>
    <P>To anyone in this House, who doubts the value of the Community as it has developed and is developing, I would ask: why do you think the countries of Eastern Europe are queuing up to join? Why do you think the Community has the capacity to help them with aid and technical advice and trade?  And why have some of the most advanced and sophisticated countries in Europe, outside the Community, applied formally to join, not the organisation as it exists, but the Union that will exist after Maastricht?</P>
    <P>The Commission has also indicated that it will not support any change in the Treaty.  Clearly our partners are not going to abandon the Treaty and its aims which took over two years to negotiate and involved the Heads of State and Government of every Community State.</P>
    <P>The other member states are not going to abandon those aims.  France and Germany in a joint statement this morning have made that clear.  Spain has made a similar declaration and the Portuguese Presidency has also spoken in a similar vein.</P>
    <P>Things have changed for Denmark. They have not changed for Ireland.  Our case for approval in the forthcoming referendum is that we should continue to be part of the future development and integration of Europe.  That intention has not changed because of the Danish decision.  The Danes have to decide where they wish to go now.  We have seen the immediate economic repercussions of their vote in the financial markets, the resulting uncertainty, and it is clear what a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote could mean for us here in Ireland.  Our commitment is to Europe, European development and European integration &mdash; for the benefit of the Irish <Col N="1359" /> people of all trades, professions and persuasions.</P>
    <P>I would ask all the main parties opposite who support ratification to join the Government, the social partners and all the other mainsteam organisations outside this House in strengthening our resolve and redoubling our efforts to secure a decisive &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June. The attention of Europe will be on us. This is not a time to climb back on the fence, to pause for second thoughts, to indulge in knee jerk reactions or to attempt to seek a renegotiation of this or that aspect of the Treaty that we may not like, which will certainly be refused.  It is a time for the greatest possible national unity and consensus at a critical moment not only for the future of Ireland.  We should not forget that we do not know what Denmark will do and that the other member states can proceed with a Treaty without us.</P>
    <P>As things stand now, we are dealing with a rapidly evolving situation.  The Commission met this morning: the Council will meet tomorrow: the Presidency will be keeping the whole picture under review.  I would like to assure the House that I will arrange for it to be informed of developments from time to time as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that at this stage Ireland must go ahead with the referendum on 18 June.  Any global renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty, which would be encouraged if Ireland at this stage, having already passed the legislation and set the date for a referendum, were to attempt to postpone that referendum, would be liable to be to Ireland's disadvantage and indeed to the disadvantage of all those countries that are likely to benefit from the Cohesion Fund to be established under the Maastricht Treaty in its present form.  A renegotiated Treaty would not be likely to include a Cohesion Fund or at least to include it in a much attenuated form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The countries which are likely to be net contributors to the fund &mdash; Denmark would have been if they had ratified the <Col N="1360" /> Treaty and will be if they eventually decide to do so &mdash; are likely to use any global renegotiation that might result from an Irish decision today to defer our referendum to reduce or eliminate their contributions to the European Community. In short, in the general renegotiation which might result from a mistaken decision on our part in this House there is a risk that the Cohesion Fund might disappear.  It is therefore in Ireland's interest to ensure there is no general renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty, although Ireland should avail of any minor changes that may have to be made if eventually Denmark decide finally before the ultimate deadline not to take part.  We could make the case at that stage for using minor alteration processes to remove or amend Protocol 17 to the Treaty which we so mistakenly inserted in the first place.  I contend that it is not a foregone conclusion at this stage that Denmark will finally opt out. If Ireland decide &mdash; it is true to say that the eyes of Europe are actually on this House today &mdash; to go ahead with the referendum, I believe there is still a strong possibility the Maastricht Treaty in its present form can be saved.  It is still possible for Denmark to change its mind after an appropriate period of delay for reconsideration and consultation.  Article R of Title VIII of the Treaty says that the coming into effect of the Treaty can be deferred &ldquo;until the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification&rdquo; by the last of the states so doing.  That date need not be 1 January 1993 and may be subsequent to it.  The extra time gives the Community an opportunity to meet the Danish concerns in other separate ways without changing the Maastricht Treaty in its present form.</P>
    <P>Clearly that is the course of action that European leaders should now attempt to achieve &mdash; to meet Danish concerns separately by other means without disturbing the Maastricht Treaty and thereby create the conditions in which the Maastricht Treaty can in its present form be put again to the Danish people with ancillary arrangements in place to meet such concerns as may have been <Col N="1361" /> expressed by the Danish electorate in the meantime.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that Europe is now plainly confused and there is no greater evidence of this than President Mitterrand's decision which in my opinion is most ill advised and a publicity seeking decision.  It is important that a country like Ireland should show that they can keep their head while the rest are losing theirs.</P>
    <P>If the Danish concerns cannot be met and the Treaty has to be modified for Eleven members only, it would be much easier in my view to get the Eleven members to agree to go ahead with something close to the existing Maastricht Treaty, which contains provisions like the Cohesion Fund, that we so much need, if at that stage we have already ratified the Maastricht Treaty.  If we postpone the referendum, we display a lack of commitment to the Maastricht Treaty and that gives all other countries which want to unscramble parts of the Treaty which might be to our advantage but to their disadvantage the excuse to do so saying that &ldquo;the Irish are not sure about the Treaty anyway&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We should not falter in our resolve on this occasion.  Indeed if we ratify the Maastricht Treaty on 18 June and it applies to only Eleven members, and not to Denmark, any new treaty for the Eleven could be a relatively simply document, simply agreeing for the Eleven what had previously been agreed for the Twelve to be ratified by the Eleven.  A simple two to three line treaty would suffice.  If, however, that course is not adopted and an attempt is made to renegotiate all the treaties of the European Community from the ground up for the Eleven members, and excluding Denmark, a whole series of negotiations encompassing all the content of the Treaty of Rome, all the content of the European Coal and Steel Treaty, all the content of the Single Act and the content of the individual accession Treaties, would have to be undertaken.  If we had to do that all over again, and this would be the only course open to us if the Maastricht Treaty were not preserved intact by <Col N="1362" /> the Eleven member states, renegotiation <i>de novo</i> would be so incredibly complex that it might never be completed.  Issues of contention between member states that have for long been dormant would be re-opened in any such global renegotiation. As a country that benefits by a factor of five or six over what we contribute, such a global renegotiation would not be in our interest.  It is vital that in the next seven days European leaders give a clear lead to their people on this issue.  There can be no procrastination. There is a real risk of conflicting signals being sent out as has happened in the past 12 hours where one member state announced it was going to hold a referendum while another announced it was going to defer the Committe Stage of the Bill to ratify the Maastricht Treaty.  These are directly conflicting signals from two responsible leaders.  It is imperative, therefore, that there be a summit meeting of European Community Heads of Government next week to set a clear political course for Europe in advance of the Irish vote on 18 June.  The Taoiseach should seek the holding of such a summit next week.</P>
    <P>In Brussels on Friday I will be meeting with the Heads of the European Christian Democrats six of whom are prime ministers of their respective countries, half the entire membership and I will ask each of these to arrange for a summit meeting next week.</P>
    <P>The constitutional status of the Maastricht Treaty following the Danish vote, and the political intentions of the 11 other member states on the matters covered in that Treaty, must be clarified at the highest political level next week by the European Prime Ministers before the Irish people cast their vote on 18 June. The Irish people must be allowed to decide the political direction they want to take on 18 June on the basis of the fullest information available about the intentions of our other partner countries. It would be most unwise to attempt to take that decision without such a high level political declaration from our partners.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say at this stage, without <Col N="1363" /> any undue use of the phase &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, that it was never very clear why the Government were in such a rush to have the referendum on 18 June, only 16 days after the Danish referendum.  They chose a date which made it impossible for us to provide any contingency plan in the event of Danish rejection of the Treaty.  Fine Gael in particular warned the Government at the time that their haste could endanger the process.  I am sorry to have been proven right on this occasion. Clearly the Government had no contingency plan for what happened yesterday. On 19 May I asked the Taoiseach in this House what would happen so far as our referendum was concerned if the Danes voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  He said the campaign would continue and we would run our own show.  I asked him to clarify the exact status of the Maastricht Treaty but he did not give a precise answer.  The Taoiseach should have had an answer to that question on that occasion rather than having the odd situation where the Government had to issue two separate statements yesterday evening about this matter, neither of which conveyed the degree of certainty one would expect.  It is important that certainty be maintained.</P>
    <P>If we are to get a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote the Government will have to change the whole tenor of their campaign.  The Irish electorate, no more than the Danish electorate, will not be browbeaten by exaggerations or threats.  There is a very good and strong case for voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; which does not have to rely either on bribes or threats.  We must make the case calmly and in a responsible manner. There is a highly idealistic case for voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; which has an appeal to young people who want to see the environment preserved and who should be advised that it is only by Europe acting together that the environment can be preserved.  There is a strong case for young people voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to preserve peace because no generation more than the young have an interest in peace.  Peace can only be preserved if Europe acts together to preserve it.  There is a strong case for voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for those who are concerned to <Col N="1364" /> have employment.  We can only create good remunerative jobs if we are able to sell our goods and we will only have markets to sell our goods if we have a strong open European market available to us.  Those calm and rational arguments must be put before the Irish people. There is no need to put these arguments in a context which relies on threats, for example, people's livelihoods will be taken away if they vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, etc.</P>
    <P>Recent developments demand a much more concerted, considered and far less complacent approach by those of us who support the Maastricht process towards European union.  There should be an immediate meeting of all the political party leaders who support the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; the Taoiseach, Deputy Spring, Deputy O'Malley and myself &mdash; to prepare a statement signed by all four of us calmly setting out the case without exaggeration or threats in favour of Ireland's endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty on 18 June.  I formally issue that invitation to my colleagues.</P>
    <P>The ratification of the Maastricht Treaty would be greatly helped by an open-ended debate in this House in which every Member who had something to say was free to say it.  As an enthusiastic supporter of the Maastricht Treaty I would welcome the opportunity of listening to and answering the arguments put forward by those Members of this House who are opposed to the Maastricht Treaty.  I have nothing to fear and I do not believe any sincere supporter of the Maastricht Treaty has anything to fear from an open-ended debate taking as long as necessary to allow every Member of this House to speak for as long as they need to on this subject.  We should have such a debate; we should let everybody speak.  This debate should be televised so that the people can see that those who support the Maastricht Treaty have nothing to fear from such a debate and do not wish to have that debate canalised into short statements of 20 minutes during which, in the case of my party, only one of 55 Members is allowed to speak.</P>
    <P>The reasons for Denmark's rejection <Col N="1365" /> of the Maastricht Treaty do not apply to Ireland.  After Maastricht, Denmark was to become a net contributor to the European Community.  However, after Maastricht Ireland will continue to receive five or six times as much as it contributes. Denmark voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; out of fear of the overwhelming influence of Germany.  It is fair to say that this is a concern in the minds of people in other countries also. However, the reality is &mdash; I say this to Danish people and Irish people who may be concerned about the same phenomenon &mdash; that it will be much easier to curb the undue influence of any one state, be it Germany or some other country, and to channel German energies into constructive paths if Germany is part of a strong united Europe than it will be if it is part of a loose confederation of European states which are favoured by the opponents of the Maastricht Treaty. People who say they are voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they are afraid of Germany are using a perverse argument.  If we want to keep Germany within the European family of nations, behaving as part of a team rather than doing a solo run, we need to keep them on the team.  Voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; is not the right way to keep them on the team.</P>
    <P>Without the Maastricht Treaty the Single Market is also liable to collapse soon.  The Single Market is an opportunity for us to solve our unemployment problem.  Maastricht will enable Europe to develop common economic, taxation, currency, environmental and consumer policies.  However, without Maastricht, countries will be free to pursue their own separate policies on each of these issues. A single barrier free market could not survive if individual states were still free, as they would be if Maastricht was ultimately rejected, to pursue conflicting economic, taxation, currency, environmental or consumer policies.  Unless the Single Market is underpinned by the Maastricht Treaty it will disappear within a few years; the Single Market will not survive without the underpinning provided by the Maastricht Treaty.  Nobody in this House should argue that it is possible to take the Single Market but reject <Col N="1366" /> the Maastricht Treaty.  Without the Maastricht Treaty, ultimately there will be no Single Market.</P>
    <P>I hope no Deputy will seek to use the decision of the Danish people to roll backwards on Ireland's commitment to a united, democratic and inter-dependent Europe.  The world is a dangerous place and ethnic conflicts abound in Europe.  It is only if Europe can act with one will, that peace can be secured in this dangerous world.  Ireland should be part of that process, helping to shape that will and a structure of peace in Europe and not sitting on the sidelines letting other people make decisions for us, the consequences of which we will have to accept one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The European Single Market, the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds, give the two parts of Ireland which have been divided since the Ulster plantation the opportunity to work together on the basis of mutual interdependence without the supremacy of one tradition over another in a form and forum which has never been possible before.  In any previous attempt to bring the two parts of Ireland closer together it was always a question of one side having the better over the other.  In the context of a European Single Market it is possible for the two parts of Ireland to become dependent on one another through closer economic and commercial links without any one side claiming that they have got the better of the other.</P>
    <P>For this House the opportunity that the Maastricht Treaty gives us to build a structure of interdependence between the two traditions, North and South, is the most cogent argument of all for voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on 18 June.  It gives us an opportunity to resolve conflicts that generations of Irish people before us, going back to Daniel O'Connell, have been unable to resolve.  We in this generation, by building on the Maastricht Treaty, have an opportunity to resolve that historic division on this island in a fashion that imposes the will of no tradition on that of another.  We should not flinch in taking that opportunity on behalf not just <Col N="1367" /> of past generations but of the generations that will succeed us in this House.</P>

      <P>Having listened carefully to the Taoiseach's address to this House I am utterly and truly disappointed if not amazed.  This important parliamentary debate was sought to elicit information and clarification on the serious situation facing the European Community in the wake of yesterday's decision.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach in his address, which does no credit to him, the Government or his advisers, in no way attempts to tackle the serious problem we are facing.  Apart from a reference to a message of deep regret by the Government to the people of Denmark, akin to thanking the parish priest for the loan of a hall for a meeting, there is no other attempt at analysing the serious position we are in. The Taoiseach's speech could have been delivered without that paragraph even if the outcome of yesterday's referendum had been different, and that is very regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty on European Union has been rejected by the Danish people.  As a matter of European law, that means that the Treaty cannot form part of European law.  There are two reasons for this, and it is important that they be spelled out as succinctly as possible: (1) Article R. 2 of Title VII of the Treaty on European Union explicitly states that the Treaty cannot enter into force until it has been ratified by all the member states and (2) even more fundamental than that, the Treaty on European Union is itself an amendment of the Treaty of Rome. Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome provides that any amendment to the Treaty must involve (a) consultation with the European Parliament, (b) an Intergovernmental conference, and (c) ratification by all the member states in accordance with their own constitutional requirements.  It is also important to point out that this Treaty was rejected by the Danish people in accordance with the provisions of their Constitution.  Had the Danish people voted in favour, they would have been delegating powers <Col N="1368" /> vested in the Danish authorities to international authorities &mdash; in this case the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Danish referendum was carried out in accordance with Article 20 of the Danish Constitution.  In effect the Danish Government were seeking the permission of the Danish people to ratify the Treaty on European Union.  If the people had said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; the Government would have been in a position to ratify, but that ratification would not have necessitated any change in the Danish Constitution. As it is, it is quite clear from the Danish Constitution, a copy of which I can make available to any Deputy who wishes to see it, that the instrument of ratification has been rejected by the Danish people.</P>
    <P>When the Danish Constitution, the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty of Rome, are examined together, the picture becomes clear &mdash; as of this moment, the Treaty on European Union is dead.  The only thing that can change that is for the Danish people to change their minds.  There is no precedent in Danish constitutional law for a proposal rejected by the people being resubmitted without the gap of a long period of time. On one previous occasion, the Danish people voted to overturn their previous rejection of a proposal to lower the voting age but the gap between the two referenda in that case was nine years.</P>
    <P>The situation that has developed as a consequence of this has been variously described by Government Ministers as a crisis for Denmark and a problem for Europe.  It would appear that as far as the Government are concerned there is, however, no problem for Ireland. Nothing could be further from the truth. It ought not to be forgotten that the Danish people were not asked to change their Constitution in order to ratify the Treaty on European Union.  Ratification of the Treaty by the people of Ireland will require a change to our Constitution.</P>
    <P>What are we being asked to insert in our Constitution?  We are being asked, first, to enable the State to ratify a Treaty which has no force in European law as of this moment.  Second, we are being asked to give institutions and bodies the power <Col N="1369" /> to make decisions and carry out acts which have the force of law in Ireland, even though they too can have no force in European law.  This is an absurdity.  It would make a nonsense of our Constitution, which has been jealously guarded, by Fianna Fáil more than any other party, for 55 years.  No Member of this House who believes in the importance of constitutional democracy can support the notion of writing absurdities into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>From the perspective of those of us who believe in the European ideal, who want to campaign for closer integration within Europe, this absurdity becomes an obscenity.  Since the decision of the Danish people became clear, we have heard Eurocrats and Irish politicans dismissing Denmark as some insignificant little country out on the edge of Europe, whose decisions really do not matter. How is it possible for any Irish politician, to argue, with a straight face, that small countries do not matter and that the only thing that is important is the European ideal?  What is the European ideal if it is incapable of respecting and accommodating the needs and aspirations of small countries on the periphery?  How can we in Ireland, above all, argue that the Danish people should be ignored and that no account should be taken of the decision they have made?  It does not matter whether we agree with their decision or not, what matters is that if Europe means anything, it means that they have the right to take that decision and to have it respected.</P>
    <P>I have already argued in public statements and otherwise that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in Ireland is in the interests of the people of Ireland, but I cannot argue that it is in the interests of the Irish people to insert a spurious commitment into our Constitution, and, as things stand at present, that is what it is.  I believe also that the result in Denmark is likely to have significant effects on the psychology of public opinion here in Ireland.  In other words, if the referendum on 18 June is proceeded with, its outcome is far less predictable than it was two days ago.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that any Government <Col N="1370" /> should be so irresponsible as to seek to press ahead with a referendum to insert a non-existent Treaty into our Constitution, and that they should run the risk of miscalculating and underestimating the attitude of the people to that proposal.</P>
    <P>It seems clear already that some of the requirements of our Constitution, particularly those relating to collective Cabinet responsibility, may well have been ignored completely in the development of the infamous Protocol attached to the Treaty.  Are the Government now going to compound that lack of proper constitutional regard by pressing ahead with a constitutional proposal, which will almost certainly require subsequent change, as the situation in the European Community develops?</P>
    <P>I fully understand the wish of the Government that an opportunity should be given to the Irish people to express a commitment to European Union and to the many social and economic aspects of the Treaty, but this is the wrong way to do it.  In addition, the Government are passing up a very considerable opportunity here.  The opportunity now exists to re-open discussion on the whole question of travel and information.  Is it possible that the Government are in fact afraid of re-opening those issues in Europe?</P>
    <P>There is a solution, and it is one that is readily available to the Government, although I have not yet seen any evidence of the Government being even aware of it.  Section 92 (1) of the Electoral Act, 1963 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, in any case in which it appears to him that there is an emergency or special difficulty, by order make such adaptation or modification of any statute, or order or regulation relating to the registration of Dáil electors or electors at local elections, or the conduct of Dáil elections, presidential elections, local elections or referenda, as may in his opinion be necessary to enable it to have effect subject to the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>The section in question was amended <Col N="1371" /> subsequently in 1977 to include European elections.  Further technical changes were made in 1985 to deal with the situation that arose when British voters resident in Ireland become eligible to vote in Dáil elections here.</P>
    <P>However, the provision of the section that relate to referenda and the powers of the Minister in relation to referenda have remained unchanged since 1963. What this means in essence is that it is open to the Minister for the Environment, if he decided that this involved either an emergency or a special difficulty, to postpone the date of this referendum to a date which would allow for appropriate consideration of all of these developments.  What that means, in turn, is that we would then have the opportunity to incorporate any and all Treaty changes arising from the Danish rejection and the negotiations and discussions which must follow that rejection.  It would also mean that it would be possible for us to deal properly with the issues of travel and information at the same time as we deal with the issues of European Union.  There is no reason why anyone should interpret such a decision here as a rejection of the principles of European Union.  In fact, it should not be interpreted as anything other than a desire on the part of the Irish people for clarity and an insistence that when they come to vote on European Union they will be doing so in full possession of all the facts, which are sadly missing at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have supported, and will continue to support, Europeans economic and social integration.  We believe in a Europe in which the rights of every citizen are equal and in which the quality of life of every citizen is capable of being enhanced through the fair distribution of increased prosperity.  Despite difficulties and challenges, the Treaty on European Union has the potential to deliver these benefits across Europe.  But it must be underpinned by a continuing commitment to the European ideal.  If we in Ireland are not prepared to stand up for the right of Denmark to have its voice <Col N="1372" /> heard, why then should we expect anyone to stand up for us?</P>
    <P>It is quite remarkable that the great brains of Europe forgot to make a contingency plan for the rejection by any single high contracting party to the Treaty in Maastricht.  If a simple contingency plan had been prepared we would not be in this great dilemma now facing us.  As of now, Maastricht is a political, constitutional, social and economic shambles.  We in this Houses should take the opportunity to have a say in the shaping of the architecture of the Europe of the future.  The first and rational step is to postpone this referendum until the autumn to enable calm and detailed consideration of all the developments.</P>

      <P>This House, indeed this country, and the wider European Community, are today faced with an utterly unprecedented situation.  The shock waves of the Danish referendum outcome are still reverberating throughout the Community, and the ripples are plainly evident here too.</P>
      <P>Long before yesterday the referendum on European Union was a source of some confusion and difficulty here at home. Not only is the issue of European Union &mdash; to do with Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union &mdash; extremely complex and far-reaching in itself, but we had the added complication of the entanglement of our own abortion controversy and the ill-fated Protocol No. 17, which sought to deal with that issue but which became especially complicated as a result of the judgment in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understandable, therefore, from a human point of view if some members of the public around the country, already somewhat bemused, confused and befuddled about the sheer complexities of what they were being asked to vote on come June 18 next, should now simply decide to shut off completely when the added complications of the Danish decision are taken into account and decide to have nothing at all to do with the June 18 referendum.  These are <Col N="1373" /> human and understandable enough reactions in this enormously complex situation. But our task as politicians is to chart a way out of the uncertainty and the political fog that is undoubtedly enveloping the whole question of European Union, particularly for our own people as they prepare to go to the polls in two weeks time.</P>
    <P>What we require therefore is cool, rational, dispassionate and informed debate on the issues now confronting us in relation to the forthcoming referendum and the issue of Euopean Union.  It is not a time for rushing self righteously to final judgements.  Detailed legal clarification is absolutely essential from the European Commission in Brussels, and indeed further clarification is needed here about the status of the decision facing the electorate on June 18 in light of the decision by the people of Denmark less than 24 hours ago.  There is little doubt, on the face of it, under Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome, that any revisions or amendments of that Treaty which the Maastricht Treaty undoubtedly constitutes, requires unanimous endorsement by all the member states of the Community.  On the face of it therefore, as some commentators have already alleged, the Maastricht Treaty as signed on 7 February last may appear to have been dealt at least temporarily a fatal blow.</P>
    <P>That is something that has to be very carefully considered.  As Leader of the Progressive Democrats, and indeed as a member of Government, I am obviously party to a range of legal opinion on the implications of the Danish decision which is going to require further careful consideration. For instance, we need to fully explore and reach definitive conclusion about the extent to which there is a possibility for the European Treaty to remain in place.  The news from Denmark this morning that interest rates there have gone up and their stock market has fallen has already highlighted the negative repercussions for that country of the vote yesterday.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly economic developments of this kind will lead to much soul searching <Col N="1374" /> and reflection on yesterday's decision.  Therefore the whole question of what the Danes will do next in consideration of their position within the European Community, and in contemplation of the proposed European Union Treaty, must be given very careful consideration by them.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a situation which, as I said at the outset, is only unprecedented but is also evolving by the hour and by the day.  For this reason we can only expect to achieve more clarity regarding the tantalising legal questions now overhanging the Maastricht Treaty after some further issues are fully teased out.  Notwithstanding the legal uncertainties which have to be clarified definitively, it is entirely appropriate that the legislative arrangements and other plans for the June 18 referendum should stand.  Some people are speaking of the possibility of cancelling or postponing the referendum now fixed for 18 June by order made by the Minister for the Environment. Article 46.2 of the Constitution provides as follows:</P>
    <P>Every proposal for an amendment of this constitution shall be initiated in Dáil Éireann as a Bill, and shall upon having been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people in accordance with the law for the time being in force relating to the Referendum.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is no obvious constitutional basis for withdrawing the Bill from the people once it has been through the Oireachtas; nor is the Eleventh Amendment on June 18 confined to the Maastricht Treaty.  It also authorises the State to ratify the European Patents Convention. It does not direct the State to ratify the Maastricht Treaty.  It merely authorises such a step.  It also provides that no acts done or measures taken in necessary consequence of such ratification should be invalid under our Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that the pre-existing consensus in favour of the Maastricht <Col N="1375" /> Treaty could fall prey to doubts and protest votes.  We have to keep a steady nerve in this unwelcome and unprecedented dilemma.  We do not want our votes to be futile or redundant.  Least of all do we wish that Ireland would send a false or inconclusive message to our European partners.  While there may be legal uncertainties at the moment bedeviling European Union, there should be, I contend, absolutely no politicial reservations in the way of Ireland's total commitment to and involvement in the process of creating a closer Union of the Community's member states.</P>
    <P>The whole European movement, which started out as an economic system aimed at ending terrible wars in Europe, has now matured over the past 35 years to a political federation seeking to unite all Community citizens under the common name of &ldquo;European&rdquo;, enjoying rights of free movement as citizens of Europe, along with free movement for goods, services and capital.  The ambition of Jacques Delors and other political architects of Maastricht is the creation of nothing less than a United States of Europe.  Ireland can gain immeasurably &mdash; economically, socially and politically &mdash; from that process.  The Irish people therefore face a very fundamental choice on June 18 and we must not confuse the politics with the legalities of that position. We Irish people must make our own decisions for ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have the right to accept or reject the Maastricht Treaty, but we cannot assume &mdash; no more than the Danes can &mdash; that the process of European Union and the huge momentum behind it emanating from the founder states of the European Economic Community &mdash; notably France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries &mdash; will simply come to a halt in order to accommodate us.  It appears to me that, like the Danes, we have the choice of remaining on or getting off the European train.  We do not have the choice of stopping it entirely.</P>
    <P>Moreover, we must not confuse the reasons why the Danish people have decided to vote against European Union <Col N="1376" /> with Ireland's vital national interests, which overwhelmingly lie in the fullest realisation of economic and monetary union and the greater development of a unifying political process.  Nothing that happened in Denmark yesterday detracts in the slightest from the absolute vital national importance for Ireland of our fullest participation in that whole process.</P>
    <P>In view of the Danish decision yesterday, it would now appear that the verdict of the Irish people on the whole process of European Union is going to take on a significance previously unimagined, as the eyes of the people in the other eleven EC states focus upon us and the decision we will take.  In one sense this is a weighty challenge to confront, but on the other hand it does offer us an opportunity to demonstrate to our fellow Europeans the overwhelming commitment of the Irish people to the whole concept of the European Community.  This exciting and pioneering excursion in human optimism, achievement and ambition has undoubtedly been dealt a severe blow by yesterday's decision in Denmark.  But the Irish people have the opportunity in our upcoming referendum to reinvigorate the whole European Union process and to give a renewed mandate and endorsement to that exciting project.</P>
    <P>I believe too that the people of Ireland should demonstrate concern and consideration for the situation of the Danish people in light of yesterday's decision. Like us, they are one of the smaller member states of the Community and I would very much like to see whatever arrangements are needed being taken in Denmark to ensure that the Danes can maintain their rightful position as full participants in building the European Union.  The smaller nations, I believe, have a unique contribution to make to the building of the Community; in underlining its diversity and by developing its capacity for the strong to help the weak. It is all summed up in the cohesion objectives of the European Union Treaty.  For that reason, as one of the smaller member states, I believe it is important that we <Col N="1377" /> enjoy the solidarity and the shared interest that particularly bind the smaller and more peripheral states within the Community.  In that context Denmark and Ireland do have important common objectives.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is not to endorse the particular objections that appear to have underpinned yesterday's referendum outcome in Denmark.  There, the overwhelming consideration appears to be fears about what the European Union might entail for Danish-German relationships and the outcome would also seem to have been heavily influenced by the current standing of the Danish Government with its own electorate.  These issues are not paralleled here in Ireland. Our referendum will provide us with an opportunity as Irish people to make one of the most important and fundamental decisions since the foundation of the State.  Notwithstanding the Danish outcome, I am confident there will be a significant majority in favour of the Maastricht Treaty here in Ireland, because it will be clear to the innate good sense of the Irish people that this country should and must, be part of &mdash; and indeed provide leadership for &mdash; a progressive and outward-looking Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland has gained immeasurably in political, social and economic terms since we joined the European Community in 1973.  It would be inconceivable for this country not to want to play a full part in the historic developments now being put into place to build a new Europe &mdash; a Europe which will not alone be better able to provide improved living standards for its own people but a Europe that will also be a pole of stability and strength and a force for peace in the new, international political order which is now evolving from the profound changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Republics.</P>
    <P>Without question unemployment is the single greatest social and economic domestic problem this country faces at the present time.  With over 280,000 unemployed it is right that we question what influence our membership of the European Community has had on these figures. <Col N="1378" /> More importantly, it is right that we ask what contribution our membership of the European Community can make in helping to tackle our unemployment problem in the future.  In my view, outside the Community the level of unemployment would be even greater than the unacceptably high levels which obtain at present.  It is not difficult to see why this is so.  Economic growth in Ireland over the past 20 years, helped by significant resource transfers from the Community, has been over one-third higher than the Community average.  This has been accompanied by an increase of over 70,000 in the total number of people employed in the economy over that period despite the significant falls in agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>The achievements of recent years, which brought our economy back from the brink of economic and social chaos, would not have been possible without the significant support made available by the community.  Direct financial transfers from the Community amounted to almost £2 billion last year alone in net terms, or almost 6 per cent of our total national income.  For every £1 we contributed to the budget of the community we received £6 in return.  In addition, the Single Market Programme, which will remove trade barriers between the member states of the Community and which will be completed by the end of this year, has already attracted significant investment in manufacturing enterprises in Ireland, particularly from countries such as the United States and Japan, to take advantage of the opportunities which the Single Market will provide across Europe.  This investment has been an important factor in the more then 55,000 increase in employment achieved in the non-agricultural sector over the past five years.</P>
    <P>The process of voluntary European integration has slowly evolved since the end of the Second World War a vision of a new Europe took hold, a Europe which would not be rent again by self-inflicted wounds in the name of a narrow nationalism and associated militarism.  The slowly emerging process was brought to a new and more formal plane by the establishment <Col N="1379" /> of the European Economic Community under the Treaty of Rome in 1957.  Thirty years later the Single European Act of 1987 provided the legal basis for bringing the integration process beyond the sphere of simply economic co-operation towards the ideal of a genuine European Community.  As part of that process the richer countries of the Community &mdash; and Germany in particular &mdash; agreed to a very significant increase in the resources to be transferred to the less developed countries of the Community to help close living standards between different countries and regions. A new and perhaps inelegant, phrase was coined &mdash; cohesion &mdash; to represent this commitment to closing the gap in living standards between the various regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>The commitment was genuine.  It involved a doubling in real terms between 1987 and 1992 of the resources to be transferred to the less developed regions to restructure their economic bases in the context of creating a Single Market. Ireland has made good use of these additional resources.  Under the reform of the Structural Funds put in place to promote the economic and social cohesion objective of the Single European Act, Ireland has received commitments of over £3 billion to support the structural reform of the economy.  This has supported a level of public and private sector expenditure for development purposes that would not otherwise have been possible.</P>
    <P>The Community's commitment to the development of less-developed countries such as Ireland is strengthened under the Maastricht Treaty.  The role of the Structural Funds as a principal instrument for transferring resources from richer to poor areas of the Community is re-affirmed and greater flexibility has been provided for in using those funds for development purposes &mdash; in the area of educational facilities, for example.</P>
    <P>For the first time the Treaty provides that the Commission will report every three years on the progress made in achieving economic and social cohesion <Col N="1380" /> and will bring forward appropriate proposals where these are needed.  This will ensure that the development of the less prosperous areas of the Community remains high on the agenda.  In future the formulation as well as the implementation of Community policies and actions must take the social and economic cohesion objective into account, an objective that is given full status under the Articles of the Treaty for the first time.  A new cohesion fund is to be established before the end of 1993 which will provide additional resources to support environmental and trans-European transport networks for the first time, together with the Commission's proposals for a two-thirds increase in Structural Funds, which form the Delors II package.  The outcome of these proposals should be that Ireland can achieve a doubling of financial transfer commitments under the Structural and Cohesion Funds over the five years to the end of 1997 in the negotiations that will take place over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Maastricht Treaty relating to Economic and Monetary Union are those with the greatest long term implications for the business sector in Ireland.  The Treaty provides, in three stages, for the achievement of full economic and monetary union by 1999 at the latest and the subsequent replacement of national currencies with a single Community currency.  The first stage has already started &mdash; from 1 July 1990.  It includes the completion of the Single Market programme by end-1992; the removal of controls on capital movements, particularly between member states; and the greater co-ordination of the economic and monetary policies of Community countries.  The second stage will start on 1 January 1994 and will involve the more intensive co-ordination of economic and monetary policies. Broad guidelines for both the Community and member states will be laid down by the Council of Ministers and the multilateral basis within the framework of these guidelines.  The process will involve certain constraints on the budget deficits of member states and the way in <Col N="1381" /> which such deficits can be financed.  The first steps in the creation of a European system of central banks will also be taken by the establishment of the European Monetary Institute which will operate to achieve closer co-ordination between the monetary policies of member states.</P>
    <P>The third stage will start on 1 January 1999 at the latest.  It will involve a European system of central banks consisting of a European Central Bank as an independent body with full responsibility for a single monetary policy for the Community together with the central banks of the member states.</P>
    <P>The ECU will become a currency in its own right.  The rates between the currencies of the different Community countries in relation to each other and in relation to the ECU will be irrevocably fixed.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Community's Economic and Monetary Union at the third stage will be confined to those countries which meet certain economic norms, specified in the Treaty, in relation to price stability, Government budgetary deficits, exchange rate performances, the level of interest rates and Government debt.</P>
    <P>From Ireland's point of view full participation in Economic and Monetary Union is a logical objective of our economic policies.  Ireland has already one of the most open economies of the Community with imports and exports together equivalent to well over 110 per cent of total national output.  By participating fully in the process now leading to Economic and Monetary, and to Political Union, Ireland will send a clear signal of economic stability and discipline to potential investors of both domestic and overseas origin in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Exchange rate uncertainties will be removed with a resultant downward pressure on interest rates.  These developments will greatly facilitate our efforts to increase investment in the manufacturing sector, for example, and the retention of associated employment that would otherwise be lost if we allow any uncertainty to develop in relation to our full commitment to the process of <Col N="1382" /> European economic integration now under way.</P>
    <P>The eventual emergence of a single currency will remove transaction costs for Irish trade within a Community which at present accounts for three-quarters of our total exports, and two-thirds of our imports.  Such transaction costs bear more heavily on the small and medium-sized industries which characterise Irish industry so that their removal will also be relatively more beneficial to Irish industry.</P>

      <P>I understand from the latest news bulletins that the Danish Government have decided to seek renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty. They have indicated they are not sure how successful they will be, nevertheless they have made a decision to seek renegotiation.  Much of the horror and surprise expressed by commentators, both journalistic and political, has been tinged with a certain degree of arrogance that the people of Denmark should attempt to refuse the good advice of their Government and all the various sister organisations of the farming community and the business community which supported the Treaty in Denmark, just as they do in Ireland.  Obviously, the Danish people took a different view.  It is improper for the Taoiseach to dismiss it as a margin of 50,000 votes.  The number of people who voted in Denmark against Maastricht was in excess of two million, and it is a denial of their democratic right to reduce that to the point which has been made with regard to the Treaty being held up by 50,000 votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrogance I spoke of also seems, unfortunately, to be in the Commission of the European Communities, who have issued a statement to the effect that notwithstanding the democratic decision of the Danish people, the Treaty of the European Communities is still valid, etc. The whole tenor of this campaign to date in Ireland &mdash; and apparently in Denmark as well &mdash; has been to the effect that we have negotiated this deal for you, it is so good we think you should accept it but if you do not accept it, the world is likely <Col N="1383" /> to end tomorrow.  I am sure there are many people in Ireland who are disappointed that the world was still on its axis this morning, following the rejection by Denmark of the Maastricht Treaty.  It is not the end of the world, or the end of Maastricht, or the end of the European Community or the end of European Union.  It is certainly a hiccup so far as Germany and France are concerned, who have declared they will go ahead in any event.  That shows a certain degree of arrogance that they are prepared to move along regardless of what the people of the other member states may decide.  That is echoed, to some extent, by the Taoiseach's speech today in which he said:</P>
    <P>Danish interests are not Irish interests; Irish concerns are not Danish concerns.</P>
    <P>Perhaps he had some reason for making that statement.  It certainly denies the European ideal which we have been treated to here today whereby the European Community was established to end wars, has prevented war and been of such great benefit to the people of Europe and so on.  We either cling to the ideals of Europe or we do not.  If the concerns of Denmark are not our concerns and our concerns are not the concerns of Denmark, then surely there is an end to the European ideal of the unity of the people of Europe.  We have to be concerned about their concerns just as France and Germany have to be concerned about our concerns.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the Danish referendum is that the Maastricht Treaty, in its existing form, is a dead letter.  The Government now have no realistic or even common-sense alternative but to postpone the Irish referendum scheduled for 18 June.  Deputy O'Malley sought to argue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="1384" /> sought to argue that there was no obvious constitutional basis for withdrawing the Bill from the people once it had been passed by the Oireachtas.  He was careful not to pin his colours to that statement because the section he quoted in the Constitution is not black and white as he seeks to imply.  In any event it seems to me that the reference in the Constitution which he quoted leaves it open to this House to amend the legislation in whatever way we see fit.  It is wrong to imply in this House that we have no option but to proceed with this referendum at this time.  Indeed, to ask the Irish people to vote on a Treaty that cannot now come into effect in its present from is to ask them to engage in empty and meaningless ritual.  What the Danish vote has done is to stop the clock on the Maastricht process and provide invaluable time for all the member states to renegotiate the Treaty and address its many shortcomings. It is an opportunity which must not be passed over by this country.  For the Taoiseach to suggest this is a crisis for Denmark but not for Ireland or the rest of the Community is like whistling past the graveyard.  The British Government have decided to defer consideration by Westminster of their legislation to facilitate ratification.  The French President has announced there is to be a referendum in their country later on. They know that the situation has changed utterly.  The only people who refuse to acknowledge that we are in a totally new situation are the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Coalition, apparently, ably supported by Deputy John Bruton and to a limited extent by Deputy Spring.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the legislation passed by the Dáil, the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Act, provides that the question to be put to the people on 18 June is whether or not they agree that &ldquo;The State may ratify the Treaty on European Union signed in Maastricht on the 7th day of February 1992, and may become a member of that Union&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever happens, the Treaty signed at Maastricht on 7 February cannot come into operation.  That Treaty was signed by the Danish Government and it has <Col N="1385" /> certain provisions which relate exclusively to Denmark and clearly these can no longer have any validity.  It has also been made clear that the Treaty can only come into effect when all 12 member states ratify.  An official document, Target 92, No. 5-1992, produced by the Commission last month confirmed this.  It stated:</P>
    <P>What happens if a Member State fails to ratify the Treaty?  Does life go on as if Maastricht had never happened or will there be a renegotiation?</P>
    <P>The new Treaty cannot come into effect until all 12 member countries have ratified it.  It is all or nothing, with no question of a Member State opting out or choosing which parts of European Union to apply.  The Treaty itself represents a complex balance of interests agreed after exhaustive negotiation, and has to be accepted as a package.</P>
    <P>If there were delays in ratification by one or more Member States, then the date of implementation would have to be postponed, just as the Single European Act was delayed by six months in 1987.</P>
    <P>The position as set out in Article R of the Treaty is as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  This Treaty shall be ratified by the High Contracting Parties in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  The instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Government of the Italian Republic.</P>
    <P>2.  This Treaty shall enter into force on 1 January 1993, provided that all of the instruments of ratification have been deposited, or, failing that, on the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument or ratification by the last signatory State to take this step.</P>
    <P>The Treaty refers to the &ldquo;High Contracting Parties&rdquo;.  It does not say &ldquo;some of the High Contracting Parties&rdquo;, a &ldquo;majority of the High Contracting Parties&rdquo; or even &ldquo;ten or 11 of the High <Col N="1386" /> Contracting Parties&rdquo;.  It is all the High Contracting Parties or nothing.  As one of the High Contracting Parties has now declined to ratify, the Treaty cannot come into effect because the requirements for ratification under Article R cannot be met.</P>
    <P>If the Government go ahead with the referendum as scheduled on 18 June, as stated by the Taoiseach today, it is clear that a subsequent referendum will have to be held at a later stage to ratify the revised Maastricht Treaty.  Apart from any other considerations, holding a referendum on 18 June to ratify a treaty which is essentially null and void would be a criminal waste of public money.  A referendum is never a cheap exercise, and usually costs in excess of £1 million pounds.  I do not believe that the taxpayer should be asked to bear the cost of a referendum which has no relevance. There is also the matter of the public expenditure on the Government's pro-Maastricht propaganda campaign.  We are told that some £600,000 has already been spent on literature, but much of this material has been rendered irrelevant by the Danish decision.</P>
    <P>Whatever now happens, there will have to be a meeting of the Heads of Government to review the position in the aftermath of the Danish decision.  It means that the content of the Treaty, including the notorious Protocol 17, is back on the table.  The Government claimed that they were unable to secure the deletion of Protocol 17 because the other Governments did not want to renegotiate the Treaty.  They no longer have this fig leaf to shelter behind.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Government ever seriously addressed the matter of the deletion of the Protocol because they did not want the Protocol deleted in the first place.  Whatever about the right to travel, I do not believe that it was ever the Taoiseach's plan to deal with the right of access to information in any meaningful way.  The Taoiseach's aim was to get Maastricht out of the way as soon as possible and to then introduce a package of measures which might have provided for a right to travel and some token rights <Col N="1387" /> to information but which would have been primarily aimed at overturning that part of the Supreme Court judgment which established a limited right to abortion here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's bluff has now been called.  He refused again in the Dáil today to clarify precisely what he intended to do, and because of his refusal to clarify that we must assume that he is bluffing. He must now declare his hand and say exactly what he plans in regard to any legislative or constitutional measures he intends to take in regard to the abortion issue.  There is no doubt that there is a need for legalised abortion here in certain circumstances and it is time this House faced up to it.</P>
    <P>The whole handling of the Maastricht Treaty by the Irish Government has been characterised by bungling and incompetence. They got a bad deal in the first place; they negotiated the clandestine insertion of a Protocol which seriously diminished the rights of Irish women; they insisted on planning the referendum for 18 June when logic suggested a referendum in the autumn after the Danish vote by which time the Government would have had to declare their hand on travel and information.</P>
    <P>What the Dáil should now be debating is the negotiating position the Irish Government should now adopt in the inevitable revision of Maastricht.  The deletion of Protocol 17 should clearly be a priority, but such issues as European defence, democracy within the Community and the criteria for the achievement of monetary union must all also be addressed.</P>
    <P>We all owe a debt of gratitude to the Danish people.  They have shown a welcome capacity to think for themselves and have taken a courageous decision in the face of fairly intensive browbeating by the leaders of some of the larger EC states.  The threatening statements issued by Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand about the smaller countries being left behind if they did not agree to every detail of their grand design were more appropriate to some self-styled European <Col N="1388" /> emperors than the leaders of countries which are supposed to be our partners in the Community.  The Taoiseach's comments in this House two weeks ago echoing those threats by Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, and which were widely reported in the Danish media, will have added to the level of resentment there and quite probably fuelled the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>What the Danish poll has demonstrated is that there is a substantial body of opinion in mainland Europe which is greatly concerned at the shortcomings of the Maastrict Treaty.  Only the Irish and Danish people have Constitutions which provide for direct consultation with the people through referenda, but I suspect that if other countries also went to the polls the Danish result would not be unique.  It also shows that suggestions made by the Taoiseach that there was no opposition in other European countries was very wide of the mark.  It is entirely possible to be a good European, to be positive about the concept of European Union, but opposed to the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>While opinion polls have shown a substantial majority in Ireland in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, I believe that the picture would have changed as the debate progressed and I believe that the Danish result will encourage Irish people to be much more questioning and sceptical.</P>
    <P>Developments are taking place which are adding to the public concern.  The most recent was the disclosure that this Government have now formally applied for observer status of the Western European Union.  This is clearly the first step towards the involvement of this country in a European military alliance.  At the same time the Taoiseach tells us that the Maastricht Treaty does not have any military implications for Ireland at this time.  One of the most extraordinary aspects of this major decision was that the Taoiseach chose to announce it at a briefing for political correspondence rather than in the Dáil.  The Taoiseach was questioned intensively by me and other Deputies in the Dáil on Tuesday of <Col N="1389" /> last week but failed to make any mention of this decision.</P>
    <P>The decision to apply for observer status of the Western European Union is one of the most significant shifts in national policy for several decades and the Dáil should have been consulted in advance.  The Western European Union is made up of nine members of NATO and a central feature of its strategy is the possession of nuclear weapons.  The country is now throwing in its lot with those who not only possess nuclear weapons, but are prepared to threaten their use to protect their interests.  The activities of the Western European Union are not confined to Europe.  It is a strategic military machine, prepared to intervene anywhere in the world where the strategic interest of any of the western powers are perceived to be under threat.  The new Eurocorps of almost 40,000 French and German troops, which was announced last week by President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl, is clearly intended to provide the basis of the military muscle for the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>Under the Maastricht agreement the European Community is effectively subcontracting defence activities to the Western European Union pending a further consideration of defence policy in 1996.  Although the Taoiseach has assured us that nothing will be done without a further referendum if the Maastricht Treaty goes ahead in its present form, we are then likely to be told in 1996 that we have no alternative, that if we do not agree to a specific defence policy we will become the outcasts of Europe and that the other member states will go ahead without us.</P>
    <P>Our honourable tradition of non-membership of military alliances and our proud record of prompting the non-proliferation treaty should be the basis for Irish policy on European defence.  We must now use the opportunity provided by the Danish referendum to insist on a re-think on European defence, instead of being carried along on the coat-tails of NATO, while pretending not to be involved.</P>
    <P>Another factor which adds to the case <Col N="1390" /> for deferment of the referendum is the current postal dispute, which, I hope, will be resolved quite soon.  We have warned on several occasions that if the current postal dispute is allowed to continue the whole validity of the Maastricht referendum could well be in doubt.  Under the 1963 Electoral Act the returning officers are required to send to each elector a polling card which &ldquo;shall be sent in sufficient time as to be delivered in the ordinary course of post... to arrive not later than the third day before polling&rdquo;. There is no organisation in the country other than An Post providing a postal service and there is none which would have the resources and expertise necessary to ensure delivery of the polling cards to each elector.</P>
    <P>There is now hope, in my view, that the dispute may end at the weekend, but even if that happens there is no adequate guarantee that An Post will be able to deliver the polling cards in the time specified in the legislation.  There is a huge backlog of mail to be cleared, especially in the Dublin area, which may take up to a week to clear.  That would bring us into the week of the proposed referendum and it seems very unlikely that the massive number of polling cards involved could be delivered in the time available.</P>
    <P>Surely for that reason if no other, we should postpone the referendum.  But I believe that the arguments in relation to the validity of the Maastricht Treaty and the fact that it is more than likely that a re-negotiation will be open in view of the Danish decision make it completely idiotic for the Irish Government to insist on proceeding with the referendum on 18 June.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with one aspect of a very serious accusation made by the preceding speaker in relation to Ireland's observer status at the Western European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple truth of the matter is that no decision has been made in that regard. I refer Deputy Proinsias De Rossa to the White Paper on the Treaty on European Union at page 106, 8.31.  It is important <Col N="1391" /> to note that attendance as an observer would not require Ireland to become a member of the Western European Union, to accede to the Brussels Treaty establishing the Western European Union, to take up any obligations under the Brussels Treaty, or to subscribe to policy positions or platforms adopted by the Western European Union.  Ireland would not become a party to the Western European Union alliance nor undertake any mutual defence commitments or military obligations under the Western European Union Treaty.  That is a matter of fact, it is not a matter of fiction&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is an outrageous suggestion to imply otherwise. On the substantive and substantial conributions made during the debate, I join with other speakers in expressing my regret that the Danish people decided, by a very narrow margin, not to agree to the ratification by Denmark of the European Union Treaty.  I also express my regret that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, a good friend of this country, has found himself in that position.  That is the decision of the Danish people, democratically expressed and the rest of the Community must respect it.  However, the decision has profound consequences for Denmark itself, which must now consider how best to adopt itself to a situation in which other member states are engaged in their ratification procedures as the Treaty requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tomorrow in Oslo I shall have an opportunity to hear the views of my Danish colleague on how best Denmark feels the Community should respond to the decision of the Danish people.  I shall also have an opportunity to hear the views of my colleagues from other member states and, of course, I shall be able to put forward Ireland's views.  The Government have carefully considered the situation as far as Ireland is concerned. We have agreed, as the Taoiseach, <Col N="1392" /> Deputy John Bruton and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, have indicated, that we must go ahead with a referendum on 18 June.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the fact that the Oireachtas has passed the necessary legislation, there are important considerations as to why we must go ahead without delay: First, we are committed to ratify the European Union Treaty.  We should not back away from this commitment even though Denmark has voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  In voting in the referendum on 18 June we will exercise our own sovereignty and take our own decision from the point of view of Ireland's best interests. Second, there will be consideration in due course by the other 11 about how to deal with the situation created by the Danish decision.  In these discussions Ireland's position will be greatly enhanced if we are committed to ratification. Third, the other member states will be going ahead with ratification.  Germany and France have announced their intention to complete their ratification process even though Denmark has decided not to ratify.  France has decided to hold a referendum &mdash; this option was always available to the French Government as part of the French constitutional process and partners were aware that it might be exercised.</P>
    <P>I know that Britain has now decided to postpone consideration of its European Communities Bill.  However, where the people do not have to be consulted it is relatively easy to vary the parliamentary timetable, and Britain is committed to ratification of the Treaty.  As a final consideration I would mention the statement made by the EC Commission this morning. In that statement President Delors repeated the Commission's commitment to the European Union Treaty and called on the other 11 member states to complete the ratification process.  It was interesting that he drew attention to the need for the Community to continue with the main points of its current agenda.  Of major importance are his proposals for increased financing, which he specifically <Col N="1393" /> mentioned, thus underlining the continued importance of the Delors II plan.</P>
    <P>In the course of their statements, Deputies have mentioned many concerns and interests arising in the context of the Danish decision.  I will bear these in mind when I meet my colleagues in Oslo tomorrow.  We will be meeting them at a formal EC Council of Ministers meeting. I welcome the decision of the Portuguese Presidency to call the meeting.  The issues to be discussed are urgent and of the widest importance and interest throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>In our discussions in this House and, indeed, in the discussions in Oslo tomorrow we should not, of course, lose sight of the ultimate objective.  That has to be to get a Treaty, which it took two years to negotiate, into force.  That Treaty contains much to strengthen European unity. It provides for greater co-operation in foreign and security policies at a time when events on our own continent require such co-operation.  It contains a timetable for economic and monetary union, which is essential if we are to safeguard the achievements of the Single Market.  It contains commitments on cohesion which are vital to the development of this country.</P>
    <P>The Danish decision does cause concerns for the rest of the Community &mdash; not least regret that Denmark is unable to join in a process which will lead to an enlarged Community to include countries which are close to Denmark in their world view.  Ireland wants to be able to find a solution to the concerns which have been raised from a position of strength as a member state which has ratified the Treaty.  I will make that point to my colleagues in Oslo tomorrow.  Ireland will not shy away from the ratification process because another member state has decided, for its own reasons, not to proceed. We exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation by taking our own decisions on the basis of a judgment of what is in our own best interests.  The Government are satisfied that our best interests lie in proceeding with ratification and I will go to Oslo tomorrow and take that position on behalf of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> I have just been informed of discussions which have taken place in Brussels this afternoon where at official level the member states took stock of the situation. They made clear their determination to go ahead with ratification. This initial reaction by partners, which will be developed at political level tomorrow, makes clear that the mood in member states, while it is one of regret at the Danish decision, is to complete the ratification process.</P>
    <P>Two years of hard work have been invested in the European Union Treaty. It contains many compromises which involved member states abandoning points of great importance in order to achieve a treaty which all of the participants felt they could have approved in their parliaments and by their people. Ireland will not turn away from this achievement and tomorrow I expect to find that other partners will take the same approach.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to the very weighty contributions made by various speakers.  In particular, I thought the speech by Deputy John Bruton was very interesting and extremely valuable.  The Portuguese presidency have said that they will not support the Danish request for renegotiation.  I will quote from the communique from the Portuguse Presidency:</P>
    <P>What I can tell you from the contacts I have had so far is that there is a strong unanimity in the sense that the Eleven should go ahead without any hesitation to fulfil the objective that they have set out in Maastricht.  The second feeling is that there is no room for renegotiating the Treaty.</P>
    <P>This is the feeling of the presidency after some contacts but, of course formal decisions will be taken and announced at the meeting to which I refer.  I have been in contact with my Danish and other colleagues in the EC because we want the decisions we take tomorrow to be made clear and understood by everyone inside and outside the Community.</P>

      <Col N="1395" /> SECTION 3</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (4), line 43, after &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;shall change the name of the College to Regional Polytechnic in the title of the College and&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to rename the regional technical colleges. What is in a name?  Regional technical colleges have, to some degree, second level connotations.  We know that, traditionally, particularly in the regions, vocational schools are known as technical schools.  Over the years, against the odds, regional technical colleges have developed well and have managed to cope with and overcome many prejudices in relation to their possibility for growth, development and success.  They are substantially funded from European Social Fund grants and are now standing shoulder to shoulder with universities and &mdash; thanks to the ESF grants &mdash; attract top quality students from second level, secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive schools.  They have, literally, arrived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technical education has become the buzz word &mdash; whether it is heralded in Maastricht, Culliton or other reports &mdash; in relation to the need for greater investment as a vehicle for the economic resurgence of this country.  These colleges now award a vast range of degrees, diplomas and certificates which are highly esteemed in the academic and industrial world.  To do justice to the regional technical colleges we should do everything possible to elevate their status further. By calling them &ldquo;regional polytechnical colleges&rdquo; I assure you that we are not copying the British title or concept.  We are looking at the word &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo; as an all-embracing title, paying the highest <Col N="1396" /> possible tribute to the colleges by saying that they are all-embracing in terms of awarding degrees, diplomas and certificates to the highest possible standard. At the same time we are enshrining the key concept of the colleges themselves by using the word &ldquo;Polytechnic&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We launched a new beginning by launching a new title for the colleges which have stood the test of time and which have done so much to advance the cause of technological education to the highest possible level.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and the reason for tabling it was to do justice to the extent and variety of courses offered by the regional technical colleges.  People might say that the name is not relevant but, very often, our graduates must go abroad to seek employment and it is very important that the names of our colleges aptly and justly describe the aspirations of the colleges and the extent of the courses provided by them. The evolvement of regional technical education and the extent and variety of courses which have been added to what was originally offered by the regional technical colleges means the name &ldquo;regional technical college&rdquo; no longer adequately describes the variety, extent and degree of courses offered by those colleges.  Indeed, it confers a lower status than they deserve.</P>
      <P>It is very simple to change the name of colleges, and changing the name to &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo; will be well worthwhile. We must now look forward to Europe and it is more appropriate to have names on our colleges which best describe the courses offered.  The term &ldquo;regional technical colleges&rdquo; would lead outsiders to believe that all courses offered in regional colleges are technical, but this is not so. There are many courses in the arts, social studies and business studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an opportune time to rename the colleges because it will describe and justify what the colleges offer.  After all, we renamed the NIHEs.  When their status was changed they were called Dublin City University and Limerick <Col N="1397" /> University.  This is a golden opportunity to rename the colleges and to give them a title which will be understood not just in Europe but worldwide.  By renaming them and calling them regional polytechnics we will put them in the way of forming partnerships with the various EC programmes such as ERASMUS, COMETT and TEMPUS.  The Minister should make this simple change which will not cause a revolution within the colleges but which will be significant for those outside the country.</P>
    <P>We want the amendment inserted because we appreciate the amount of work, the extent of the programme and the calibre of the courses offered by our regional colleges.  We also want the variety of the courses to be recognised.  We are doing the colleges a disservice by calling them technical colleges.  They are not just technical colleges, they are colleges which offer a wide variety of courses and, for that reason, they should be renamed &ldquo;polytechnics&rdquo;.  We would do the colleges an enormous service and give them the status they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment tabled by my two colleagues.  The term &ldquo;Regional Polytechnic&rdquo; would grant full recognition to the fact that the colleges are involved in more than just technical subjects.  Indeed, over 50 per cent of the courses included in regional technical colleges are in the areas of business, art and design, languages, social studies and adult courses not related to technical subjects. It is time we gave these colleges a new image and a new name.  As Deputy Ahearn said, it is important that we give them a new name to ensure that the various qualifications obtained at the regional technical colleges are recognised internationally.  The word &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo; is used widely not only throughout England but in other parts of the world as well.  Therefore I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time it is important that we retain the word &ldquo;regional&rdquo; because, as has been mentioned already, we must view this development in the regional technical colleges as part of the regionalisation <Col N="1398" /> process within Europe.  The colleges must be seen as the centre of regions and act as a catalyst for various developments in the future having regard to the considerable number of opportunities that are being presented to them in this Bill.  For a number of reasons therefore it is only reasonable to ask that the Minister of State accept this amendment.  I appeal to him to accept it as this would be in the best interest of the colleges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this amendment, the purpose of which is to raise the status of the colleges in the perception of the public.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to one aspect of this matter and that is that not all of the colleges have moved in the same direction.  Some have moved ahead at a rapid pace while others have adhered to their original mandate.  I cite as an example the college in my own area of which I and the people of Waterford and the region are very proud.  Sixty per cent of the students who will attend Waterford Regional Technical College in September this year will pursue degree courses whereas the national average is 10 per cent.  This highlights the discrepancy which exists between the various colleges.</P>
      <P>There is a school of thought, with which I can sympathise &mdash; this matter does not arise in the context of these two Bills &mdash; which suggests that not all the colleges should be given the same name. I believe that those colleges which have progressed, broadened their spectrum and extended the number of degree courses and other qualifications on offer should receive special consideration to highlight the progress and the advances which have been made by such colleges. While I support the amendment, I ask the Minister of State in his reply to address the issue of giving colleges such as Waterford Regional Technical College, which is the most successful college in the country, the same name as other colleges which have not sought to progress at the same rate.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> May I suggest, if the amendment is unacceptable, given that we have a Dublin Institute of Technology, that the Minister of State should consider giving all these colleges the title &ldquo;institute of technology&rdquo;? In that way we could have the Carlow Institute of Technology, Sligo Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology and so on.  If the Minister of State cannot accept the suggestion that the word &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo; should be included in the title perhaps he might consider mine instead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to change the name of the colleges to regional polytechnics.  Some representations have been made to me with regard to changing the title of the regional technical college.  It seems however that there is no consensus on what the new title should be.  The evolution of the regional technical colleges over the past 21 years has been remarkable and their title does not seem to have been an inhibiting factor in this development. <Col N="1400" /> This Bill will allow further adaptation and development to take place.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I am not convinced that this is the right time to change the name.  I should point out however that subsection (5) provides that the Minister may, by order, change the name of a college.  I will sympathetically consider the views of the governing bodies and concerned interests in this regard. However I do not think it is necessary to make that change at this stage and I would not be willing to accept the amendment. Perhaps I could consider it before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State left the option of looking at the matter before Report Stage open as we will be pushing it.  I wish to make the point that now is the time to make the change.  We came up with this title only after consulting widely with the various colleges which had an input by way of representations and it seems there is consensus.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will have the option of changing a title, by order, subsequently; but it is obvious that he will have to come up with a uniform title to ensure that we do not have different titles for Carlow, Sligo and Waterford Regional Technical Colleges.  What we are now doing is enhancing and elevating the role of the colleges and trying to do a good job for them.  We should complete the job by giving them a title which has found wide acceptance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahearn and I did not dream up this idea and are not aping the British model.  The title &ldquo;polytechnic&rdquo; speaks for itself and is all embracing.  It covers technical education and the other disciplines which have been taken on board successfully by the colleges during the years. I sincerely ask the Minister of State to consider this amendment before Report Stage.  If he checks with the various colleges he will find that this title has found wide acceptance.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's reply in which he left his options open.  There is consensus in <Col N="1401" /> regard to the title suggested in our amendment.  I wish to point out to the Minister of State that there is consensus with regard to the need for a change in the title.  Nobody will dispute that fact. All of the colleges have confirmed to us that their status is not reflected in the title &ldquo;regional technical college&rdquo;.  Therefore this is the right time to meet the need for change in the title.  While my colleague, Deputy Browne, has suggested the title &ldquo;institute of technology&rdquo;, what we are looking for is a title which reflects the status that they deserve.</P>

It is proposed therefore that for discussion purposes we take amendments Nos. 11a, 35a, 40, 40a, 76a, 159, 159a and 167a together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No 11a:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (5), line 47, after &ldquo;name&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and to acquire, hold and dispose of land&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides, as a function of the college &ldquo;to acquire, hold and dispose of land.&rdquo;  This is necessary consequent on the decision that henceforth the land would be vested in the college rather than held in trust for the college by the vocational education committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as initiated all land which was vested in a vocational education committee for the purposes of a college was to be held by the vocational education committee in trust solely for the purposes of the college.  However, it was a function of the governing body to manage and maintain all property of the college, including land held in trust by the vocational education committee, for the purposes of the college.  I consider that these provisions constitute an unnecessary <Col N="1402" /> overlap of responsibilities and are out of line with the aim of giving colleges as much autonomy and responsibility as possible within the framework of agreed policies, programmes and budgets. Therefore I now propose to vest college land in the college, which is provided for in amendment 159a to section 18, which amendment also deletes the original provision. Amendment No. 11a is a standard provision consequent on this decision.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 35a to section 5 is also consequent on this decision, enabling colleges, where necessary, to acquire land subject to the normal requirement of approval of the Minister. Amendment No. 40a to section 5 is also consequent on this decision as it renders unnecessary the provision in subsection (3) to allow gifts of land to the college to be held in trust by the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 76a to section 7 deletes reference to the college managing and maintaining all property of the college, including land vested in the vocational education committee for the purposes of the college, and is consequent on the decision to vest land in the college.  Amendment No. 167a to section 18 is also consequential on vesting the land in the college and provides that, in the event of a question arising in relation to whether land stood vested for the purposes of a college or with regard to the transfer of rights and liabilities, such question will be referred to the Minister for decision.  Therefore amendment No. 40, in the names of Deputies J. Higgins and T. Ahearn, is no longer relevant in the context of vesting the land in the colleges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I seek clarification? Initially it was intended that the lands which would be inherited by the colleges under the new provisions of this Bill and those lands that would come into the possession of the college subsequently would be owned and held in trust for the colleges by the principal vocational education committee, that is the vocational education committee which functioned in the area in which the <Col N="1403" /> regional technical college was located. Why has there been a change of heart on the part of the Minister and his Department in that regard since that was the kernel of the Bill as at present drafted? Can the Minister explain why that change of heart has taken place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this constitutes an unnecessary overlap.  Since the sole function of the vocational education committee was to vest the properties for the use of the college, there was an overlap. Because of that we are now putting it directly to the colleges themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the main points of contention at present on the part of the vocational education committees. We are all aware that they are very concerned about their diminishing role in regional technical colleges. However, I feel that this will further distance the vocational education committees from the regional technical colleges.  On the other hand, I can foresee it being very important from the point of view of sports facilities and the provision of outdoor centres involving agricultural land and from the point of view also of distance/access education.  While on the one hand I predict the vocational education committees will find it objectionable, on the other hand I can envisage that, from a practical point of view, it would probably be more workable.  I know the Minister's intention is to eliminate the overlap of responsibilities which may have militated against progress in the past.  But, as Deputy Jim Higgins said, this was one of the sections of the Bill under which vocational education committees retained some say in the overall regional technical college system. They are very concerned that this is now being taken from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument that there had been an unnecessary overlap of responsibilities under the previous provisions of the Bill may on the face of it sound a compelling one.  The bottom line here is that in the latest amendments <Col N="1404" /> there is an underlying development, which is to remove the vocational education committees from having any effective role <i>vis-á-vis</i> the regional technical colleges.</P>
      <P>A question which occurs to my mind, is this.  Suppose a particular college ceases to operate in the future for any reason, what happens the property at that stage?  Under the system by which the property would have been vested in the vocational education committee, I take it the property would revert to the vocational education committee.  But under the new provision, if a college ceases to operate, will the land and buildings be left in no-man's-land?</P>
      <P>I would not set my face against progress or efficiency.  Nevertheless, I perceive this amendment as forming part of a pattern in terms of downgrading the role of vocational education committees, which over 21 years have developed these colleges to their present state nationwide, of which we can be very proud.  Therefore, I do not view this amendment in isolation but rather as forming part of an overall shift in policy.  If we are to believe some of the leaks at present emerging, it could very well be that there will be no vocational education committees catered for in the provisions of the Education Act &mdash; that they will be abolished.  I perceive this amendment as forming part of an overall strategy to remove the only democratic education provided in this instance at second and third level.  On that basis I am very much opposed to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I can only repeat what has already been said.  We are hoping in some way to ensure that the role of the vocational education committees in the development of the regional technical colleges is maintained, that they will have some element of influence and control between the colleges, the Minister and his Department. It is very unfortunate that the Minister himself is not here to reply.  It appears the Minister of State is unable to explain to us what led to this major change of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> In our debate to date we had been saying that henceforth about the only thing over which the vocational education committees would have control would be the holding of the land.  When this was being discussed last autumn we argued for more power and influence for the vocational education committees, or the local education authorities, which were being spoken of by the Minister at that time, so that there would be some element of democratic control maintained. I think the notion of the local education authorities has been completely dropped by the present Minister because there has been no mention of any element of local democracy.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the vocational education committees will lose their last hold on regional technical colleges.  Everybody seems to think this is a clear indication that the Minister is phasing out vocational education committees entirely.  Is this the Minister's intention? The present Minister is obviously changing the content of the Green Paper from what was originally in it on the introduction of this Bill.  The Green Paper has still not been published and we still do not know the Minister's thinking on education in general and vocational education and training in particular.  We are only getting an indication of what he has in mind for the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to debate this issue &mdash; particularly when the Minister cannot be present &mdash; without referring to any other area of education, when we do not know what the future holds for vocational education and the role the democratic element will play in vocational education committees or in any area of education.</P>
    <P>We would certainly like to know the reasons for this dramatic change in policy.  It may be great, but I would like the Minister to explain the reasons for this change.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State is unable to explain what will happen as a result of these changes.  Perhaps the vocational education committees may have a role which we do not know about as the Minister may be tabling amendments of which we are not <Col N="1406" /> yet aware.  It would be useful if the Minister of State could give us a lengthy explanation of the new attitude to the vocational education committees and the regional technical colleges in his Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I intend to comply with your wishes and confine my remarks to the amendments before us, which, as you know, deal with reducing the involvement of vocational education committees in the governing and running of regional technical colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a tilt at this topic earlier in the day, the Minister of State claimed that the raft of amendments before us were in line with the position as set out by the then Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, when she introduced this Bill in November and that he was responding to the wishes expressed in this House at that time by introducing the amendments now before us.  I invited him to indicate to us where any Member of this House had sought to reduce the involvement of the vocational education committees in the running of the regional technical colleges because I certainly could not recall any such request being made either on Second Stage or during the earlier part of the Committee Stage debate.  I would like to know who took the initiative in the intervening time to introduce these <Col N="1407" /> amendments, the effects of which are to drive the vocational education committees out of third level education.</P>
    <P>During the earlier part of the debate, considerable concern was expressed that the Bill as it then stood envisaged a very diminished role for the vocational education committees, indeed, I would like to quote from the pertinent contribution of the then Deputy Dempsey on 21 November last.  I do not intend to quote his entire contribution but selected sentences because I think this contribution gives a very accurate flavour of the contributions made here during the course of the earlier debate.  At column 687 of the Official Report of 21 November 1991, he said:</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Education referred to the need for colleges to maintain strong links with the vocational education committees.  I regret that these Bills will not do that. They will diminish and almost break the link with the vocational education committees.  The only functions the vocational education committees will have will be to act as trustees for the land and property of the colleges, to pay superannuation to the staff and to nominate people to the governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Now even those functions are being taken from the vocational education committees under the Minister's amendments. I wonder where the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, stands in relation to the Bill at present, because he developed the point in columns 689 and 690 of the Official Report of the same date.  He said:</P>
    <P>...local democratic input was vital in the development and expansion of regional technical colleges.  It is absolutely vital that this input is maintained and strengthened.  For that reason I again appeal to the Minister, in considering these Bills either in the context of the Green Paper or the Committee Stage debate, to restore the vocational <Col N="1408" /> education committees to their rightful place in the regional technical colleges scheme of things.  I believe these Bills pander to the wishes of a small but powerful minority, including some principals of the regional technical colleges who see an enhancement of their status in the Bills and the opportunity to rid themselves of the shackles of local democratic control and accountability. I believe this small minority is supported by highly placed officials in the Department who are anxious to regain control of the success story of Irish education over the past two decades.</P>
    <P>These are sentiments with which I fully concur.</P>
    <P>We are owed an explanation as to where the sudden change in the direction of these Bills came from.  Why is the limited involvement of the vocational education committees in the regional technical colleges now being excised?  We are owed an explanation for that.  I would like the Minister of State to state specifically if the principals of the regional technical colleges sought to have the role of the vocational education committees reduced since the commencement of this Bill.  Did they have meetings with the present Minister for Education and did he agree to any request from them to reduce the role of vocational education committees?  To what extent did he consult with the IVEA and with the TUI? Did those bodies agree that vocational educational committee should have a reduced involvement with the regional technical colleges?</P>
    <P>We are due an explanation as to why a set of amendments which were not sought by Deputies &mdash; as far as I can recall &mdash; or which had not been sought publicly except, perhaps, by the principals of the regional colleges &mdash; and to be fair to those principals I understand, although I do not agree with the reasons they would seek to have the role of the vocational education committee, reduced.  They are perfectly entitled, as is any other interest group, to lobby the Minister on that but I cannot recall anybody else seeking to <Col N="1409" /> have this position changed.  I would like to know how we came to this point.  It is not unusual for a Minister during the course of a debate on a Bill to introduce new sets of amendments, but generally the introduction of new sets of amendments results either from demands made in this House or in the course of the public debate, but that has not been the case in this instance.  The only thing that has happened since the Bill was introduced is that there has been a change of Minister.  I would have preferred if the Minister for Education was present to hear the concerns being expressed about the change in policy which he seems to be encouraging.  A change of Minister brings with it a change of policy.  I do not know whose song the Minister is singing in this instance.  Having regard to the comments by Deputy Dempsey, as he was then, I cannot imagine that this change has widespread agreement in the Government.</P>
    <P>We are owed an explanation as to the rationale behind the introduction of these amendments.  What are the political reasons for their introduction?  Where did the pressure come from and who is behind it?  These amendments were certainly not sought in this House.  I am absolutely opposed to them and they run completely counter to the general drift of the debate so far on this Bill.</P>

      <P>Concern has been expressed by Deputy Gilmore and others about the number of amendments and their effect on the purpose and intent of the Bill.  Only a very small number of changes are being proposed to the Bill. These changes require a large number of consequential technical amendments to various sections of the Bill to reflect the original changes.  This amendment, which deals with the vesting of land in the colleges, illustrates this point. Consequent on the amendment to vest land in the regional technical colleges a series of subsequent amendments are necessary to reflect this change in other <Col N="1411" /> sections.  This amendment also underlines the fact that there is no change from the principle of the Bill which is to give the colleges real autonomy on a firm <Col N="1412" /> statutory basis.  The power to own, acquire and dispose of land is fully consistent with and reinforces this principle.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(a) the vocational education committee,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The rationale behind this amendment relates to membership of the college. Membership of a college is a rather vague term.  None of us is quite clear what it means.  It would seem to be an inexcusable omission that the parent body of the college should not <i>en bloc</i> be members of the college.  As the Bill stands, members of the college will be the members of the governing body.  Six of them will be members of the vocational education committee.  There will also be members of the academic council, members of the staff, the registrar of students at the college, the graduates of the college and such other persons as the governing body may appoint to be members.  It would seem that the remaining eight members of the vocational education committee will be omitted.  That would be rectified by this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general issue in relation to membership of the college which should be addressed.  Graduates of the NUI and of Trinity College have a vote in the Seanad elections and each group elects three Senators.  There is no such provision for regional technical college graduates.  The Minister should take <Col N="1417" /> steps to provide that the graduates of regional colleges be included in the Seanad electorate.  There is a like amendment in the names of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Garland.  The remaining eight members of the vocational education committee should be members of the college.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us exactly what membership of the college entails and what rights go with membership.</P>

      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 14 seek to make members of the vocational education committee members of the college. I do not see that it would be appropriate to do so.  Vocational education committee members who are also members of governing bodies will, of course, be included.  I am not prepared to accept this amendment or amendment No. 14, which has the same purpose.</P>

      <P>Why will the Minister not agree to this amendment?  Will he tell us what membership of the college means? If it is so important that it cannot be made available to the eight remaining members of the vocational education committee we would like to know what those eight members are being denied?</P>

      <P>The members of a college shall be the members of the governing body, the members of the academic council, the members of the staff, the registered students of the college, the graduates of the college, and such other persons as the governing body may appoint to be members.  Membership of a college is an honorary concept and is standard in third level institutions.  It does not convey powers, duties or functions.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael attitude would be very much tempered by the composition of the governing body.  The governing body as constituted in the Bill under subsection (4) (a) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>six persons shall, subject to <i>paragraph</i><Col N="1418" /> (b), be nominated by the vocational education committee;</P>
    <P>The section goes on to deal with further representation of the other vocational education committees within the catchment area.  The Minister has tabled amendment No. 55 which reads:</P>
    <P>In page 6, subsection (4) (a), line 43, to delete &ldquo;six persons&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eight persons, of whom at least five shall be elected local representatives,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would seem that vocational education committee members are represented already but that the purpose of this amendment is to enhance the number.  If we can get an assurance from the Minister that the number will be increased from six to eight, we would have no problem in leaving things as they stand.</P>

      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Higgins, on this amendment. As the Minister explained, membership of the college is more or less an honorary position.  It is far more important that we have adequate vocational education committee representation on the governing body which will have decision-making powers and will be involved in the running of the college.  We are happy that membership is being increased to a level where the vocational education committee representation will have a real say in the running of the college.  For that reason we accept that only vocational education committee members on the governing body will be considered for honorary membership of the college.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), lines 4 and 5, to delete paragraph (f) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) representatives of FÁS.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide a stronger interlinkage between the regional technical colleges and FÁS.  It is obvious there should be the maximum possible liaison between the regional technical colleges and FÁS.  The regional technical colleges have the facilities, top class personnel, the expertise and the track record.  Indeed, I would venture to say far more power should be vested in them in terms of providing apprenticeship training.  If one refers to the Vocational Education Act, 1930, one will <Col N="1420" /> see that it is specifically enshrined in that Act that the vocational education committees were to be the training agencies. FÁS are a new agency and have met with a relative degree of success although I would apportion a certain amount of criticism to them.  At present, with the exception of apprenticeship training, FÁS are regarded as a peripheral player. The Cullition report makes a number of recommendations and sets down various options in relation to FÁS one of which is option 3 &mdash; which was recommended &mdash; that FÁS should be subdivided into two sections, first, industrial training and, second, employment support.</P>
    <P>I suggest from a cost effective viewpoint as well as from the point of view of making good education and training sense that the scarce resources which are available for education and training &mdash; very often we use both in the same breath &mdash; should be rationalised, that there should be greater liaison and co-operation and the two should not be mutually exclusive as at present.  From the point of view of maximising this liaison I suggest that somebody from FÁS should be included in the college composition as part of the corporate identity of the college. They have excellent facilities, a proven track record and the personnel. Every possible effort should be made to strengthen and enhance the liaison between the regional technical colleges and FÁS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. A vacuum in our educational system today &mdash; it is a pity we allow it to continue &mdash; is the lack of co-operation and cohesion between the different educational authorities.  Greater cohesion, greater co-operation and greater movement of students from one college to another would enhance education today. Considering that FÁS are our national training agency and taking into account that the vast majority of training provided is in the technical area it is vital that there should be co-operation and cohesion between the service provided by FÁS and that provided within our regional technical colleges.  It would be <Col N="1421" /> beneficial to FÁS and to the regional technical colleges if representatives of FÁS were members of the regional technical colleges.  It is not enough to provide training and education in one specific area without having an eye on what is provided at other levels.  If we had such co-operation we could have a continuation of some of the courses provided by FÁS as a foundation to courses that students may eventually follow within the regional technical colleges.</P>
      <P>I am totally opposed to a distinction or a division between agencies that provide both education and training.  Because of the divisions and the lack of cohesion and co-operation students are losing out, and as a nation we are losing out, on what could be far better apprenticeships and far better graduates.  Particularly at this time with such an appalling level of unemployment we must grasp every opportunity that arises to train, retrain and educate our people for the world of work and for the employment opportunities that arise not only here but abroad.  It would be a positive step to include representatives of our main training agency, FÁS, as members of the college and I hope the Minister will generously consider this statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would remove the right of governing bodies to appoint other persons to be members of a college and would include representatives of FÁS as members.  I consider the provision, as it stands, to be quite appropriate and I am not prepared at this stage to accept this amendment. However, for the benefit of the Deputies I think this would be more appropriate to section 6 which outlines the composition of the governing body.  Under the provisions of section 6 (f) it would be open to the vocational education committee to nominate that organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We take the Minister's point that it is possibly more appropriate to another section.  However, I do not think it is inappropriate that they would be nominated in their own right as distinct from being one of the nominees of <Col N="1422" /> the vocational education committee.  I appreciate the Minister's point that if he accepted the amendment at this stage he would preclude the possibility of appointing others.  This is something we will certainly be looking at on Report Stage.  As Deputy Ahearn said, the lines of distinction between FÁS and the regional technical colleges are quite blurred.  They are funded from the same source, the European Social Fund, because of their training element.  They are distinct from the universities which deal with the humanities and the more general world of academia.  There is a considerable amount of overlapping between FÁS and the regional technical colleges.  We hope the Minister will accept this suggestion at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept our recommendation that FÁS be nominated in their own right.  If we are serious about the role FÁS are to play in providing training and education, it should not be left to the vocational education committee to appoint a representative of FÁS; they should be appointed in their own right.  If we leave it open, FÁS may not be represented on the governing body.  It is because of the importance of FÁS as a training agency that they deserve representation in their own right and I hope the Minister will consider this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (1), after <Col N="1423" />&ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with particular reference to the region served by the college&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for the inclusion in section 5 (1), dealing with the functions of colleges, of a phrase, &ldquo;with particular reference to the regions served by a college&rdquo;, in response to concern that the regional remit of the college could be overlooked.</P>
    <P>The principal function of a college will therefore now be as follows: &ldquo;to provide vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State, with particular reference to the region served by a college.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Shea and Mac Giolla in amendment No. 19 seek to have this point covered in subsection (1) (a).  It is more appropriate to include it in the statement of the principal function of a college at the start of the subsection and, accordingly, I will not be accepting amendment No. 19.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (a), line 14, to delete &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage concerns were expressed by Deputies who referred to the number of times phrases such as &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo; appeared in the Bill.  The <Col N="1424" /> impression was given that control was being centralised in the Minister and the Department.  I have already assured the House that what would be at issue in most cases would be the laying down of ground rules but I now propose to go further by removing reference to ministerial involvement except where it is considered to be absolutely unavoidable. This should demonstrate beyond doubt that there is no intention to frustrate the stated aim of the Bill to allow the colleges to exercise autonomy in their day-to-day operations.</P>
    <P>It is accordingly proposed to delete the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;, from the following subsections in section 5: (1) (a), (1) (d), (1) (f), (1) (g) and (1) (i).  These changes are made through this amendment and amendments Nos. 28, 32, 34 and 37.</P>
    <P>This principle of deleting ministerial involvement is carried further in amendment No. 108 to section 10 which proposes the deletion of &ldquo;subject to such requirements as the Minister may from time to time specify&rdquo;, in relation to the academic council's function in the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students and in amendment No. 198 which proposes to delete &ldquo;to such requirements as the Minister may lay down&rdquo;, in paragraph 14 (a) of the Second Schedule which deals with the governing bodies function with regard to admission to the college and to courses of study.</P>
    <P>However, with regard to section 5 (1) (c) and 5 (1) (e) I consider it necessary that the Minister should be enabled to determine conditions in relation to colleges engaging in research, consultancy and development work.  This would, however, be envisaged as a once off determination.  I cannot, therefore, accept amendments Nos. 26 and 30 from Deputies Mac Giolla and Garland.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 27 and 29 from Deputy O'Shea I do not consider it appropriate that these conditions should be laid down by means of an order and I am not therefore prepared to accept these amendments.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 33 <Col N="1425" /> from Deputies O'Shea and Garland, amendment No. 32 removes the Minister's role in 5 (1) (f) with a view to allowing colleges maximum autonomy in relation to their day-to-day operations. The inclusion of the vocational education committee instead of the Minister would not be consistent with this principle and I am not therefore prepared to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea's amendments Nos. 35 and 38 which seek to provide that the condition would be determined by order of the Minister are not relevant as the Minister's determining condition is being deleted through amendments Nos. 34 and 37.  His amendment No. 31 also seeks to insert that provision in 5 (1) (e).  I do not consider an order necessary or appropriate in this provision and I will not be accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the reservations we had about these subsections. The reason I was seeking to have &ldquo;by order&rdquo; inserted in the subsections was to retain as much democratic control as possible.  In other words, if the Minister held the power to determine conditions in relation to these sections he would have to do so by order, and any later amendment provides that these orders be placed before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>By way of amendment to section 5 (1) (a) the Minister is about to remove the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  The phrase is not used in section 5 (1) (b).  Section 5 (1) (c) relates to research, consultancy and development work and I believe that the Minister has a definite function in laying down guidelines in that regard. The phrase is being removed from section 5 (1) (d).  Section 5 (1) (e) reads:</P>
      <P>subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine, to enter into arrangements, including participation in limited liability companies, to exploit any research, consultancy or development work undertaken by a college either separately or jointly;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another area in which there is a <Col N="1426" /> definite need for guidelines.  For instance, if an important discovery were made which involved patenting rights and so on, such guidelines would be necessary. I do not have a problem with the retention of the phrase in that subsection. Section 5 (1) (f) and section 5 (1) (g) are about to have the phrase removed. Section 5 (1) (h) does not include the phrase in the first place.  The phrase is also to be removed from section 5 (1) (i).</P>
    <P>In general terms I compliment the Minister.  He has met the fears that many of us had in relation to the Bill following a centralisation policy.  It is obvious that there is a need for very firm guidelines in relation to research and development and to what could be called campus companies. I am happy enough with the direction taken by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the deletion from the subsections referred to of the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  The inclusion of the phrase in all of those provisions overbalanced the Minister's powers.  After all, the section maintains the need for the Minister's approval in cases in which that is required.  At least the governing body is given the power of recommendation.  I have no difficulty with the two subsections that will retain the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;, because they relate to areas of particular significance; research, consultancy and development work and matters that would involve much financial outlay.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposals are a step in the right direction.  We all criticised the over-emphasis of the Minister's powers under the legislation, an emphasis that was so predominant throughout the Bill that it underestimated the powers of a governing body within a college.  It was not good to maintain that approach in the legislation.  I appreciate that the points outlined by many of us who spoke during the Second Stage debate have been noted by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Likewise, I welcome the deletion from the various subsections <Col N="1427" /> of the reference &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;. The phrase was a very intimidating opening to any provision.  The heavy hand of the Minister was present from the outset. As Deputy Ahearn has said, the presence of the Minister as a safeguard and in an overseeing role is retained within the various provisions but at least the intimidation of opening a subsection with that reference is being deleted.  I thank the Minister for that.  I should like to accept the Minister's assurances in relation to the removal of the over-centralisation of power in the Minister.</P>
      <P>Everything would be fine in relation to that deletion were it not that today the Minister circulated another document, a document which gives quite frightening centralisation powers to the Minister.  We shall deal with the deletion of references to the recommendation of the vocational education committees in relation to appointments and so on when we come to it.</P>
      <P>Section 5 <i>in toto</i> is one of the Bills most vital sections.  One of the most under-utilised areas of exploitation in this country has been that of research and development. Prosperous economies are based on their ability and capacity to innovate and to produce new products and new processes to meet the challenges of the times, particularly in research and development.  Section 5, which allows for scope in this regard, is vital and is very welcome.  Over the years we have produced numerous talented graduates from our universities.</P>

      <P>I shall address my remarks on section 5 when we reach it.  I should like to point out that the Minister's attempt to allay fears by removing the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo; does not succeed because there is further evidence <Col N="1428" /> of a strangulation of the power of vocational education committees in other parts of the Bill and in the thrust of the amendments circulated today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) to confer, grant or give diplomas, certificates, degrees or other educational awards;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Higgins said, we have come to a very important part of the Bill.  The principal functions of the college are outlined in this section 5.  The Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991, which is moving in conjunction with this Bill and should be before the House next week, contains a different section 5 (1) (b).  Section 5 (1) (b) in that legislation relates to the conferring, granting or giving of diplomas, certificates or other educational awards other than degree awards.  The Dublin Institute of Technology award their own certificates and diplomas.  In the case of regional technical colleges diplomas are conferred by the National Council for Educational Awards.  Amendment No. 20 seeks to grant the same right to individual colleges to confer diplomas as is to be granted to the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology Bill does not provide for the conferring of degrees.  For many years the institute have had a special relationship with Trinity College as regards the conferring of degrees on students who study at the <Col N="1429" /> institute.  Other things are happening outside the House in relation to the whole degree area in the RTC sector which are relevant and important to this Bill and which should not go unmentioned at this stage.  Earlier this week a newspaper report stated that 22 degrees were cleared by the National Council for Education Awards but that they had been blocked by the Department of education and that the colleges are prevented from providing these courses, which is very regrettable. The report also stated that the Department are working on a guideline, which was reported to have emanated from the NCEA, that the 10 per cent level of students throughout the RTC sector who are at present pursuing degree courses would be maintained.</P>
    <P>Another matter which should be alluded to in the context of this amendment is the announcement by the Government earlier in the year that the maintenance portion of ESF grants is to be meanstested.  This will cause terrible inequity and will obviously prevent students from pursuing courses which they would have otherwise taken.  That is a fundamental flaw.  It will also mean that students who make marginal decisions in relation to pursuing courses at regional college or university level will, because the maintenance portion is meanstested, now opt for university rather than RTC courses.  This will reduce the number of high calibre students entering the RTC sector, which is also very regrettable.</P>
    <P>We must look at colleges in their context. Cork, Galway and Limerick already have a university to confer degrees, but in the city which I represent &mdash; I make no apology for being parochial &mdash; there is not a degree provision and, as the Minister knows, there is no university throughout the south eastern region.  It is vitally important, from the point of view of regional development in not just the Waterford area but in other areas in which there are regional colleges, that the degree part of the college is allowed to grow and is not subjected to artificial, arbitrary figures which come from a Department providing Thatcherite policies <Col N="1430" /> in education.  There is a whole development whereby the liberal content of courses is being diminished and I believe that there are further plans in this regard.  It is highly regrettable, because the bottom line in education is that you educate the whole person to the very best of his or her potential.  I believe that policies are afoot to prevent this.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to give greater freedom to the colleges to grow in an organic way in response to the needs of the regions.  It is regrettable, as other speakers said, that the role of the vocational education committees in relation to the colleges will be so greatly and sadly diminished by this Bill.  The policy of the Department of Education seems to be to reduce what these colleges provide and to push colleges like Waterford and others who have moved from their basic mandate back to it.  The Department want the colleges to provide technical and some business education, but there is inequality in terms of access to a full range of education.  This is a socio-economic and geographical factor because, for instance, in the south-east region a student has half the chance of getting a degree compared to a student in County Cork.</P>
    <P>This Bill, particularly in relation to some of the amendments, will move in the opposite direction from which the European Community aspires to move in relation to subsidiary &mdash; in other words, there will be centralisation.  Dublin has more than 40 per cent of the population of the country.  Effectively, there are four universities, six colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology and 30 per cent of the students attending those colleges are pursuing degree courses.  It is now the stated policy of the Department of Education to reduce the number of regional colleges.  The Department pay lip service to what these colleges have achieved &mdash; and they deserve all the praise they can get.  However, in terms of a liberal education agenda, of growing and providing a wider range of qualifications for people in the degree area &mdash; the &ldquo;add on&rdquo; in the technical area, arts, commerce and so on &mdash; the Department's <Col N="1431" /> policy is undoubtedly one of reducing the availability of a wide range of education provisions in rural areas, which is a retrograde step.  In years to come, when this legislation needs to be amended or changed, it will be seen that Thatcherite decisions were made on this occasion.  It is an accountancy approach to education; it is not about education being an integral part of regional development. This will be looked on as a very sad, unproductive period.</P>
    <P>The colleges should be given the power to confer their own degrees, diplomas and certificates.  The degrees are probably the key area.  There are provisions in the Bill in this regard, but they are limited by guidelines contained in a recent circular letter sent to all the colleges in the country.  Desirable changes were made, with which I agree, but this Bill is disastrous for rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the extension of powers to the regional colleges to confer diplomas, certificates and degrees. They have expanded and extended to such an extent that it is regrettable to set limitations on the goals which they want to achieve.  I oppose the notion that the granting of a particular status of educational award, be it diploma, certificate or degree, should belong to one area of education.  In other words, it should not be the prerogative of the universities to award degrees.  Courses which are worthy of degree status, irrespective of whether they are provided in a regional technical college, college of technology or university, should be awarded that status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a difficulty, however, with the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Shea and perhaps he will elaborate further.  He is proposing that all colleges should have the power, in their own right, to award certificates, diplomas and degrees.  What I would like to ask him is whether he is implying that the NCEA would have no role and that we would have nine regional technical colleges providing their own certificate, diploma and degree courses. If that is so, I would have my worries because I believe there is a need for a <Col N="1432" /> body to monitor the content and status of courses and the academic standards attained.  Unfortunately, we could undermine the status of such awards if the wording was left too loose and the colleges could do this as of right.  I would like to ask Deputy O'Shea if he envisages the NCEA continuing to have a role and to state which body would have a role in watching and guarding the standards that have to be achieved.  If he can allay my fears I would support his amendment.</P>
    <P>During the course of her Second Stage speech the then Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, stated that while the Dublin Institute of Technology would retain its power to award its own diplomas, certificates and other awards, nevertheless degree awarding powers could at an appropriate time be assigned to the institute under this provision.  As I said during the course of my Second Stage speech now is the time to make such changes.  We will pursue an amendment in this area strongly.  It was inappropriate for the then Minister to say, given that we are dealing with major Bills which will have an effect on the colleges, that we should leave it until a more appropriate time to give them degree awarding powers, as there is no time like the present.  I give the Minister of State notice that we will pursue this matter strenuously when we come to deal with the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill.</P>
    <P>It is our intention, as I said, to encourage the regional technical colleges in relation to the work that they are doing. I would also like to pay tribute to the NCEA for the work they have done to date.  Indeed, they have played a positive and significant role in relation to the development of courses within our regional technical colleges.  I will have to await Deputy O'Shea's explanation before I will be able to say how I will approach his amendments.  I seek clarification from him as to the role the NCEA would have and as to which body would monitor certificate, diploma and degree courses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <P>Deputy Ahearn's question as to the future role of the NCEA <Col N="1433" /> if this amendment were to be accepted by the House, is both fair and valid.  It is my understanding, in relation to NCEA exams, that the colleges set and correct their own examinations and that these are monitored by the NCEA.  I believe that the marketplace makes its own statement as regards the qualifications attained at various colleges.  I believe also that the marketplace knows where the strongest qualifications are attained and responds accordingly.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of standardisation, whereby the tests would be the same in various colleges, the NCEA could continue to play a role in this regard; but I do not think a major adaptation would be required in the present system in relation to my amendment.  It is important that I state also at this stage that when we talk of freedom in relation to educational institutions academic freedom is the bottom line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we are dealing with amendments Nos. 19 to 25, I would like to say a few words on some of them.  First, in relation to the amendment that we are discussing, the purpose of which is to give colleges the right to award their own certificates, diplomas and degrees, like Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Ahearn, I would like to see these colleges develop and given the right to award their own qualifications provided, as Deputy Ahearn said, we can be certain that the examinations will be standardised.  I am not keen on the idea of allowing the marketplace to decide, although that would be one barometer.  At the same time, however, colleges in the United States award a variety of diplomas and doctorates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the question of standardisation is important, there is also a need to protect the integrity of the qualification.  We need to be assured therefore that the NCEA would have a monitoring role. While the colleges would set the examinations and decide whether they should award certificates, diplomas or degrees, it is vital that the NCEA would have a supervisory role to protect the status and integrity of the examination.  While the <Col N="1434" /> colleges would set the examinations the NCEA would approve them and give them their <i>imprimatur</i>&mdash; in other words, they would validate them.</P>
    <P>There is a mystique surrounding degree courses.  This matter needs to be examined because the regional technical colleges have developed courses during the years which in many cases are on a par and in some cases better than the courses provided by the National University of Ireland.  I do not know whether Deputy FitzGerald, who is close to the university scene, would agree with me but we have to loosen the strings in relation to the provision of degree courses in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>Amendment 24 seeks the insertion of the words &ldquo;in Northern Ireland or&rdquo; in subsection (1) (b) which at present reads:</P>
    <P>To enter into arrangements with the National Council for Educational Awards, with any university in the State or with any other authority approved by the Minister from time to time for the purpose of having degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards conferred, granted or given;</P>
    <P>The Minister might usefully consider adding the words &ldquo;or in Europe&rdquo; in view of the discussions at present taking place.</P>
    <P>The position is that a number of students from the Republic now attend courses at Queen's University, Belfast, or at the New University of Ulster in Coleraine.  Very often we pay lip service or engage in clichés about &ldquo;hands cross the Border&rdquo;.  I cannot see why the words we seek to be inserted cannot be inserted. They would ensure liaison with universities in the North of Ireland.  That would be very much in the spirit of the age, something we could usefully take on board and would create a greater fusion of educational interests between here and the North.  After all, education is the greatest single instrument for dismantling obstacles and barriers which lead to misunderstandings. We should endeavour to enter into as much dialogue as possible with third level colleges in the North. Why not include Queen's University, <Col N="1435" /> Belfast, and the New University of Ulster in Coleraine?</P>
    <P>One of the large growth sectors in the South &mdash; within a few hundred yards of this House &mdash; is the proliferation of private, third level colleges, many of whom have made arrangements with universities and third level institutions in Britain from the point of view of awarding qualifications and validating the courses they offer.  I cannot understand why we would not broaden the scope of the intention of this section by at least taking on board third level colleges in the North.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I missed part of the discussion on these amendments. However, I fully endorse the proposal for granting RTCs power to confer, grant or give diplomas, degrees, certificates or other educational awards.</P>
      <P>Possibly I may have been under some misapprehension in that I think the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; should have appeared in my amendment No. 23.  I fully support what Deputy Jim Higgins has just said, that the words &ldquo;in Northern Ireland or&rdquo; be inserted in subsection (1) (b).  The movement of students to attend courses in universities in Northern Ireland is so high that the provisions of our higher education grants scheme apply in the case of students attending universities in Northern Ireland, recognising the fact that there is such movement.  Indeed, we should encourage the transfer of students in both directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support amendment No. 24 to include Northern Ireland.  I am sure if the Minister were present he would accept that proposal.  Probably it was something that was omitted from the drafting of the Bill, particularly bearing in mind growing developments between universities in the Republic and Northern Ireland, which should be encouraged.  To have those words inserted in this section would constitute a great advance, particularly since the application of our higher education grants to students attending universities in Northern Ireland recognises that movement.  Acceptance of this amendment <Col N="1436" /> would be an extension of that logical inter-change of students.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister did not fully clarify the section as it stands.  I agree that the National Council for Educational Awards appear to be the relevant authority to organise arrangements for the purpose of having degrees, diplomas, certificates and so on, conferred, granted or given.  I presume that some such arrangements have been entered into already with universities &mdash; certainly in the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology &mdash; for the granting of such awards. Presumably the intent of the section is to allow for arrangements to be made with the National Council for Educational Awards or with any university in the State or &mdash; if Deputy Jim Higgin's amendment is accepted &mdash; with any university in Northern Ireland, or with any other authority approved by the Minister from time to time.  The whole point is that RTCs should have authority to confer, grant or give degrees, diplomas certificates or other educational awards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">

      <P>I strongly advocate the acceptance of amendment 24 tabled by Deputy Jim Higgins and myself in recognition of the increased flow of students to Northern Ireland to follow educational courses there.  It is important that we recognise that flow in the provisions of this Bill.  There has been an enormous change in education in recent years.  Mobility is no longer a problem and students are prepared to attend any college or university to which they can gain access and which provides the courses they seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we grasp every opportunity to cement our relationship with Northern Ireland.  This section affords us such an opportunity.  Acceptance of this amendment would be a positive, generous response on the part of the Minister.  If we are in earnest about improving our relationships with Northern Ireland it is equally important that we avail of every opportunity so to do. In that respect, this section affords us an opportunity to recognise our desire and <Col N="1437" /> aspiration for closer links with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage the point was made about the need to provide for the regional technical colleges to make their own awards.  It has since been clarified that what is intended is that some arrangement should exist under which the regional technical colleges could grant college awards in a relatively small number of instances.</P>
      <P>Section (5) (1) (b), as it stands, allows the colleges to enter into arrangements with the National Council for Educational Awards, with any university in the State, or with any other authority approved by the Minister from time to time for the purpose of having degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards conferred, granted or given.  In most circumstances qualifications resulting from a successful completion of courses in the colleges should be awarded by either the NCEA or a university.  However, I can accept that, in a relatively small number of cases, at least in the short term, there is need for colleges to be in a position to award college qualifications, which is the purpose of amendment 25.  However, I do wish to retain approval of these arrangements. I do not consider it would be desirable to have a proliferation of awards in the regional technical colleges in addition to those which will be awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards, or a university, under arrangements entered into under the provisions of this subsection.</P>
      <P>Amendment Nos. 20, 21, 22 and 23 all relate to colleges awarding their own qualifications, including degree awards.  In the concluding speech on Second Stage it was indicated that to give colleges power to award qualifications at this stage was not necessary or appropriate. However, this has not been ruled out altogether.  The provision in section 5 (2) (a) would allow for such functions to be awarded in future if this were considered appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of amendment No. 24, in <Col N="1438" /> the names of Deputies J. Higgins and T. Ahearn, I do not consider it necessary to make specific reference to Northern Ireland as provision exists in the subsection for colleges to enter into arrangements with any authority approved by the Minister from time to time for the purpose of having qualifications awarded.  However, let me inform the Deputies that I would approve of such arrangements if the circumstances warranted it.  Because of the strength of the Deputies' argument and the manner in which they expressed their concern, I will reconsider this amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in section 5 (1) (d) for colleges to enter into arrangements with other institutions in or outside the State for the purpose of offering joint courses of study and therefore I will not accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer specifically to a matter raised by Deputy O'Shea when he referred to what he saw as an attempt by the Department to restrict course development in regional technical colleges following on the issue of a recent letter to the colleges on the subject of new course approvals.  What is in question is the Department's desire to end the current position where approval for new courses is required from both the Department and the relevant validating body. Far from trying to centralise the matter, the Department want to leave the matter up to the colleges and the validating body, but subject to agreed policy guidelines.</P>
    <P>The position regarding degree courses being at about 10 per cent of the total provision is in line with the current situation and is something that will be subject to further discussion in arriving at the guidelines mentioned above.  I am aware, of course, that certain colleges, such as Waterford Regional Technical College, have a much higher rate of provision of degree level courses and there is no question whatsoever of pulling back from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister for his comments on the strength of <Col N="1439" /> our argument in support of inserting &ldquo;in Northern Ireland or&rdquo;; and, while he agreed to look at this amendment again on Report Stage, he pronounced with a certain vehemence that he would not accept our amendment.  Perhaps I detected a vehemence in his voice which he had not intended and perhaps he should have said this more <i>sotto voce.</i> However, is the Minister prepared to consider this amendment seriously, because we will table it again on Report Stage?  It is important that the Minister has power to permit this to happen subsequently. We believe, as Deputy T. Ahearn said, that now is the time to bring this matter to finality and make it as comprehensive and as conclusive as possible by enshrining the term &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; in this legislation.  This has a certain symbolism about it apart from the fact, as Deputy Mac Giolla says, that it is now a fact of life that there is a great deal of dialogue with Northern Ireland. Let me add that it does not impose an obligation on the colleges in the Republic and it does not force anything on the colleges in the North but it is simply creating an option.  We want to put that option in positive terms rather than leaving it to the Minister to enable colleges to so do at some stage in the future.</P>

Did the Minister say that the guideline is that 10 per cent of students attending regional technical colleges would pursue degree courses?  Did that guideline emanate from the NCEA, from the Department of Education or who issued that <Col N="1440" /> guideline?  Will the Minister clarify if it is NCEA policy to limit the number of students pursuing degree level courses in the RTC sector to 10 per cent at this point in time?</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Minister's statement to reconsider our amendment on Report Stage, this is not the first occasion that we have been given that commitment.  I cannot understand why the decision cannot be made now and why we have to procrastinate.  It adds to the sense of incompetence in the way we conduct our affairs.  The amendment was tabled last November and it was debated in detail by speakers on this side of the House during the Second Stage debate.  I believe this gave sufficient time to give the matter serious consideration. If the amendment is acceptable, why can it not be accepted now instead of deferring it yet again to Report Stage?  That will only lead to a rehash of the whole issue now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me warn the Minister, in a positive manner, that we will be tabling this amendment again on Report Stage and we will take it again to the very end. As a great many of our students will be banished from our regional colleges <Col N="1441" /> because of the introduction of a means test for the ESF grant, they will be seeking refuge and seeking to continue their third level education in Northern Ireland. For that reason I believe it would be a positive gesture to accept our amendment at this stage.  While I regret having to make that statement on the students who will no longer be able to accept a place in our regional colleges because our ESF grants are means tested, nevertheless it is a reality.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why we are procrastinating about this amendment.  It has been supported and I have not heard any valid arguments from the Minister objecting to this amendment.

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter which is of serious concern to the workers at the Aurion plant and to the <Col N="1448" /> whole population of Cork city.  The latest unemployment figures for Cork city and county are at an all time high of over 30,000.  Nearly 17,000 of those are in the Cork city area and a large percentage of these are on the north side of Cork, an area that has been devastated by closures, redundancies and short-time working. The news that yet another closure was imminent last weekend was a body blow to the whole area, particularly to the 140 strong workforce in the Aurion plant at Kilbarry Industrial Estate.  This news was particularly bad when one takes into consideration the fact that a highly skilled management and workforce are making an excellent product, but due to circumstances beyond their control will lose their jobs in a few weeks time.</P>
      <P>How much more can Cork city take, particularly the north side?  In the last 12 months there have been well over 1,000 job losses in the north side alone.  The area is devastated.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Ministers of State and other Government Deputies have an obligation to take whatever steps are necessary to stop this haemorrhage of jobs so that this firm, which is less than three years old and which has an excellent record, can be saved; or, as a last resort that a replacement industry should be found to save the badly needed 140 jobs in a city already shattered by record job losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for giving me two and a half minutes of his time.  It is becoming monotonous to come into the House to deal with job losses in Cork.  It is also becoming tragic. Just three weeks ago we came in here and spoke about the potential job losses in Apple.  Some of us were accused of being alarmist, but the jobs there are still under threat.  On top of that, 140 jobs will definitely go in Dublin Hill in the Kilbarry Estate.  This news came at the start of a holiday weekend when the workers were unexpectedly told that their jobs would go within four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> In parts of my constituency we already have 70 per cent unemployment.  How much more can we take?  It is ironic that on the morning on which the job losses were announced, the Minister for Finance was reported in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> as saying that there is no recession in this country.  There may not be a recession for some people but the people depending on jobs and those depending on social welfare are struggling for life.  People cannot exist without jobs.  There is no hope.  The further job losses in Aurion in Dublin Hill brings things to a crisis.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be here tonight, but the Progressive Democrat Minister seems to distance himself from job losses at all times.  What steps have been taken to ensure that the jobs can be preserved in Cork?  Why do the jobs have to be transferred from Cork to Dublin? What amount of taxpayer's money has been invested by way of grants in this industry and how is taxpayer's money safeguarded by the IDA?  What repayment will be made by the industry?</P>
    <P>One hundred and forty jobs may be just a number but it represents 140 families which will have to survive without jobs and there is no hope for them except the dole queues.  The Taoiseach today in the House talked about the Jobs Forum and about the interdepartmental committee which is looking at the factors affecting job creation; but attention is not being paid to the haemorrhage of jobs in this country, especially in Cork city, over the last number of months.  I would ask not for lipservice in the House tonight but for real answers from the Minister to a horrendous crisis in our city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies O'Sullivan and Allen, together with Deputies Quill and Wallace, have made great efforts to bring to the attention of the IDA and the other relevant authorities the problem facing the north side of Cork city in the light of what <Col N="1450" /> happened in the past number of weeks and also over the weekend.  It is important to put the facts before the House and not sensationalise what has happened, as Deputy Allen has been doing by not speaking factually in the last few minutes. Aurion Limited was set up in 1990 to manufacture cable harness on a sub-contract basis for a Dublin based customer. The customer company have now indicated that they intend to take this subcontract work back in-house and that they will be phasing out their orders from Aurion Limited.  The Aurion management, in conjunction with the IDA, have discussed the situation with the customer company and they sought a commitment to retain one production line in Cork for one year in order to give the Aurion company breathing space to obtain new business.  Unfortunately, these discussions were unsuccessful and the result will be the complete closure of Aurion Limited on 26 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no sensationalising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The customer company's decision is no reflection on the quality or competence of Aurion Limited. It is a recognised commercial reality that enterprises operating in a highly competitive environment have to continuously review their operational strategies, including their sourcing arrangements.  In this particular case such a strategic review led to a corporate decision by the customer company's overseas parent that a certain retrenchment was necessary in order to secure the viability of a sister company within the corporate group.  Regrettably, in this instance the Irish sub-supplier was the victim of this business decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience of Aurion underlines the vulnerability of companies who are solely dependent on a single customer to purchase their output.  Aurion had been aware of this potential vulnerability in their operations.  It had always been the <Col N="1451" /> intention of Aurion to broaden their base long before the present situation arose. A number of possibilities both at home and abroad had been looked at but no commitments had been entered into.</P>
    <P>The management of Aurion Limited, in conjunction with the IDA, are currently investigating a number of possibilities which it is hoped will lead to firm business opportunities in the future. These investigations are ongoing, but no immediate outcome which will save the 140 jobs in question is likely.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tá mé an-bhuíoch díot, a Cheann Comhairle, go bhfuil an deis seo agam labhairt ar son na ndaltaí atá dall.  This is a very difficult time of year for all students but it is particularly difficult for students taking examinations through braille.  I wish to highlight the difficulties posed by the junior certificate geography paper.  The examination will take place on Thursday of next week and as of today the teachers of geography have not received instructions from the Department as to the changes which will be made.  The sample paper supplied by the Department includes an ordnance survey map and a map showing rainfall, on which questions have to be answered.  Obviously a person who cannot see a map cannot answer questions on it.  A week before the examination these teachers should know what modifications will be made so that students can be prepared.  The best of students can be put off if the format is changed and they are not sure what is coming up.  It cannot be beyond the ingenuity of the Department of Education to devise questions that can be written out in braille.  The Department should notify the teachers in schools for the blind what the modifications will be so that the children will be prepared.  It is not too much to ask the Department to <Col N="1452" /> take action at this late hour.  This problem should not have arisen.</P>
      <P>A parent contacted me whose daughter has been studying for four years for this examination.  When I contacted the school I was told that only one examination paper was supplied last year, which had to be photocopied, thereby holding up the examination.  There should not be any skimping and the required number of papers should be supplied.</P>
      <P>I was shocked to find that the principal of this school has no secretary.  The school caters for over 80 students who are blind or visually impaired.  It is indefensible that there is not a secretary to deal with problems.  For the sake of the principal, whose sanity must be at risk, I would ask the Minister to accede to the request from parents and management that a secretary be appointed.  Above all, the Minister should make sure that the geography paper is such that will give these children a fair crack of the whip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Alyward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Browne, for raising this matter and allowing me the opportunity to clarify it.</P>
      <P>Question papers for the certificate examinations are provided by my Department in braille form for visually impaired candidates where requested. Where question papers are requested in braille form they must, in some instances, be modified so that, where necessary, visual elements of the papers are given in a descriptive format.  For example, the picture series questions in the modern language examinations are modified in this manner.  Where this is not possible as, for example, in the case of some mathematical or scientific diagrams, alternative questions of a similar standard are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further option is available in subjects where a given number of questions must be answered from a particular section of the examination paper in that visually <Col N="1453" /> impaired candidates may be permitted to exceed the usual limit placed on the number of questions to be answered.  An example of this is in the case of leaving and junior cert geography where the Ordnance Survey question is compulsory.  In the case of candidates taking the braille version they are permitted to substitute a question from the other sections of the paper i.e., physical, economic or social. I should also add in regard to geography that alternative questions are provided where a question, or a section of a question, contains a map or other visual element, that is, bar chart.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should add that arrangements for visually impaired candidates are made in co-operation with the schools catering for these candidates and I wish to place on the record my Department's thanks and appreciation for their assistance and advice in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I and other public representatives from the area were recently invited to attend a meeting to consider the crisis being faced by the Ballymun Home Help Service.  The service can take no new referrals unless they can remove an existing client from their list.  If their indebtedness continues at the current rate they will not be able to get facilities from the banks to overdraw any further by October or November next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ballymun Home Help Service provides home care facilities or support to 184 clients.  Many of these clients are aged.  Unusually in the Ballymun area the aged group are not the dominant group. The case load of the service also includes families in stress, in respect of whom they do vital work.  They also care for the <Col N="1454" /> disabled, a small but very important group.  In Ballymun there is a substantial need for the psychiatric back-up service which they provide.  Home-making is another valuable service provided at minimal cost to the State.</P>
    <P>I was horrified to find that not only in Ballymun but throughout the home help service in Dublin people in need of support cannot be accepted unless existing clients are crossed off the list.  In the past one could always rely on being able to offer the home help service to support, say, an elderly person looking after a spouse at home.  One can no longer guarantee that service.</P>
    <P>The financial problems of the Ballymun Home Help Service began last year when for the first time they received insufficient funds to meet the budget they provided to the health board.  They were unaware until December that they were being given a limited amount of money. Some form of breakdown in communications seems to have occurred at local level.  As a result they had a substantial deficit at the end of last year which they understood was to be cleared by the Eastern Health Board.  It was paid but they were told that the payment was made by withholding their running costs for January and February of this year. They have an ongoing inadequacy of funding running at about £1,000 a month. Their major problem is the deficit and the fact that the situation in relation to PRSI payments for part-timers is unclear. I know my other colleagues will wish to raise that point and will support my case that this minimal service should be funded adequately.  It is a particular attack on women with low incomes who have the opportunity of assisting themselves and their community through this service.</P>

      <P>Following an enlightened and convincing visit and discussion yesterday with Sister Catherine and her esteemed assistants in Ballymun I did <Col N="1455" /> have, as promised, a discussion with the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, this morning to plead the merits of this vital service catering for a total of 184 people including the aged, the handicapped, the invalided, and psychiatric and stressed persons.  Accordingly, I welcome the opportunity of going public to endorse everything that has been said by Deputy Flaherty, and which will be added to by the other representatives, so that a sufficient amount of money will be made available for the survival of this vital service.  I hope to make possible the development of such a special service in this area.  It did strike me yesterday when speaking with those people that what they had been allocated approximated to slightly less than that which was given to members of respected professions recently for one week's work. If this House cannot make available the amount of money required for these special services we should be looking at other areas where we can effect economies so that a service like this could be better looked after.</P>

I do not want to cover the ground already dealt with by both of my colleagues in Dublin North-West except to emphasise that our social services and our health services depend to an extraordinary extent on voluntary organisations. It is time we established some formal way of ensuring that these organisations which are providing essential services are budgeted for in a more comprehensive and organised way. There is a constant stream of people &mdash; I am sure all Deputies will confirm this &mdash; whose budgets are running out of money and who are up against deadlines.  They spend much time either trying to raise funds or to obtain money from Departments. I appeal to the Minister to provide adequate funding for the Eastern Health Board to maintain the home help service. <Col N="1456" /> In this I would include also Aoibhneas Women's Refuge, located in Ballymun, who are also in serious financial difficulties. There is a general issue here which needs to be addressed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who, but for the provision of such a service, would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide or support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards are not limited in the categories of persons they can assist at home and may charge for the service. The health boards consider individual <Col N="1457" /> cases on the basis of need and in the light of resources available to the scheme.  In practice, about half of the home helps and the vast majority of meals are provided by voluntary organisations with funding from health boards.  The remaining home helps are employed directly by health boards.  The balance between voluntary and health board input to the home help service varies from health board to health board.  Home helps are predominantly part-time, though a number of full-time home helps and home help co-ordinators are employed by some boards.</P>
    <P>The role of the voluntary committee in the home help service is to provide a service, on the health board's behalf, to those persons requiring care and assistance at home so that they can continue to live independently within the community. To this end, the committee act as the employer of the home help organiser and her staff.  The committee must also maintain an overview of the service within their area, ensuring that the service is effective, flexible and responsive to the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>In addition to ensuring that a high quality service is provided, the committee must ensure that adequate systems of financial control exist for receipt and disbursement of funds, and that an annual audit of the committee's financial affairs is carried out.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform Deputies that the overall percentage increase in the amount allocated by the Eastern Health Board to the home help service in recent years has been considerably greater than the percentage increases in allocations to other services or, indeed, to the board's own allocation generally.  Every year an allocation is made to each community care area from the programme's total allocation.  The director of community care and administrator then allocate this to the organisations in the area having regard to a number of factors.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board endeavour to inform organisations of their allocation <Col N="1458" /> as early as possible in the year so that they can budget for their service.  The Ballymun home help service were advised of their allocation in early March this year.  In allocating the funds for 1992 every effort was made to maintain the 1991 level of expenditure.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the Ballymun home help service was allocated £101,000.  The 1992 allocation is £115,000.  I would like to emphasise that Community Care Area 7, in which Ballymun is situated, is receiving a very high proportion, 19 per cent, of the overall sum of £3.7 million which the Eastern Health Board have allocated to the home help service this year.  I should add that the number of elderly people or families being assisted by the Ballymun home help scheme increased from 135 in January 1991 to 177 in December 1991 and to 184 in March 1992.  I am informed by the Eastern Health Board, that the area director of community care and area administrator are still in discussion with the home help organiser in Ballymun concerning this year's financial allocation and, in fact, a further meeting will take place within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two-minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for the Marine.  I propose to call on the Deputies I have selected in the following order: First, Deputy Nealon and, second, Deputy Deenihan.  Each Deputy is entitled to two minutes in respect of each matter and each of the statements will be followed immediately by a two-minute reply by the Minister for the Marine.

      <P>Permission has been sought from the Minister for the Marine, who controls our foreshores, for the erection of ESB pylons to carry power cables from the mainland at Strandhill to Coney Island.  This is Coney Island in Sligo Bay &mdash; I hasten to add &mdash; not the other one named after it.</P>
      <P>Granting of this permission, and the consequent erection of the pylons, would amount to an act of State vandalism. Sadly, we have already many examples in the north-west of power pylons and poles ravaging the beauty of the countryside, most notably in Barnsmore Gap in Donegal and, not far behind, in the Windy Gap on the Ox Mountains.  We do not want another &mdash; this time without any excuse that it is necessary &mdash; in Sligo Bay.</P>
      <P>Whether seen from land, sea or air we have here one of the great panoramic views of the west.  For instance, on planes coming into Sligo airport at Strandhill, the normal flight path will take you over Lough Gill and Glencar Lake with Benbulben to your right and to the left Knocknarea with Queen Maeve's cairn. In the distance are the Ox mountains and the mountains of Donegal; below Coney Island are Inishmurray in Sligo Bay, Strandhill and Rosses Point and on a clear day Lissadell can also be seen.</P>

Finally, I want to remind the Minister that failing to get planning permission for Coney Island would create no precedent. The first man to receive a rebuff was, in fact, Saint Patrick, who wanted to build <Col N="1460" /> a church there.  Legend has it that an old pagan woman, called Stoner, who disapproved, took unilateral action. Instead of serving a pair of rabbits she served a pair of cooked cats for the Saint's dinner.  That was the end of the church on Coney Island.  But Saint Patrick did build a church on the mainland nearby at Killaspugbrone where the pylon line would actually start.  He also promised the people of Coney Island that the tides would always allow them to get to Mass on the mainland with dry feet and so they do.  That clearly indicates there is another feasible way of getting electricity to the island without spoiling the scenery.</P>

      <P>I would have to agree with Deputy Nealon about the beauty of the area.  I had the pleasure of viewing it from the new national pensions office we built on a hill overlooking the area.</P>
      <P>The ESB have applied to my Department, under the Foreshore Act, for permission to erect a power line over the foreshore from the mainland to Coney Island. The distance involved is approximately 300 metres.  The application does not entail the placing of pylons or poles on the foreshore.  I am advised that any such structures would be erected above the high water mark.  I can advise the Deputy that the application to my Department was advertised in the local press on 17 April last.  A number of comments have been received from interested parties.</P>
      <P>My Department are now assessing the comments received.  In addition to this process of assessment, the application, together with the comments received, has been referred to Sligo County Council for its observations.  A response from the county council is awaited.  When I have received the views of the county council, together with my Department's assessment, I will consider the matter further. I can assure the Deputy that all concerns, including those expressed by himself, will be taken into account in reaching a decision on the application.</P>

      <P>During the course of his address at the IMI conference in Killarney, the Taoiseach stated that it was the Government's intention to establish a Europort on the Shannon Estuary with similar capacity to Rotterdam.  Whether it was off-the-cuff remark following Dr. Tony Ryan's suggestion of an air bridge from Shannon Airport to Europe or genuine Government policy remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope it was not a repeat of the several promises made by many of the Minister's colleagues in the past.  These include turning a sod for a proposed aluminium smelter in 1981 prior to the June election of that year, posing for a photograph in <i>The Kerryman</i> and announcing a new marina, the announcement of the setting up of a port in 1984, the announcement of a Toyota car factory in 1989 with a promise of more than 3,000 jobs and a more recent announcement of the setting up of a port facility by private investors when the proposal was very much in the initial stages of investigation &mdash; it has since been abandoned.</P>
      <P>They are just some of the promises which have been made to the local people who are now totally disillusioned and cynical because of this gross irresponsibility. It is totally unfair to make these promises and raise people's hopes when there is no foundation for them.</P>
      <P>In a recent reply in the Dáil the Minister indicated that a proposal was being examined by his Department, in consultation with the Taoiseach's Department and other Departments and State agencies.  I would like to point out to the Minister that we have had several studies on the future potential of the Shannon Estuary, including the report of An Foras Forbartha in 1984 and a special study carried out by the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1990 which was never published.  What we need in the Shannon Estuary is a definite commitment to providing the necessary funding to develop the infrastructure to allow development to take place.  The last thing we want is another empty promise.  The local people deserve better.</P>

      <P>My Department are currently examining the feasibility of establishing a strategic trading bridgehead in the Shannon Estuary to boost maritime traffic and create jobs.  Such a facility would be geared to service trade with the European Community, the American continent and major third country trading blocs.</P>
      <P>A key element of the examination is the viability of a transhipment facility or terminal to facilitate transfer of cargo from one ship to another in the Shannon Estuary as an intermediate port en route to final destinations.</P>
      <P>The examination involves consultation with the Taoiseach's Department, other Government Departments and the relevant State agencies.  My Department will also have regard to the views of Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour Trustees in formulating development policies.  Initially, the examination will involve a comprehensive assessment of existing facilities in the estuary and potential interests and markets for transhipped goods by mode and destination.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Estuary is already making a valuable contribution to the national and regional economy.  Since 1965 some £2,000 million had been invested in port related industry in the estuary and the range of port facilities includes marine terminals located at Moneypoint, Tarbert Island, Foynes Island, Aughinish, Dernish Island together with Limerick City Docks, Foynes Harbour and Kilrush Harbour. Port facilities in the Estuary can handle vessels up to 200,000 deadweight tonnes. Total maritime traffic in 1991 through the port facilities was 7.5 million tonnes consisting of exports of alumina, meat, timber and horticultural products and imports of coal, bauxite, petroleum products, fertilisers and animal feeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scope for future development building on the current strengths of the estuary and its range of facilities is considerable. At present the maximum size <Col N="1463" /> of vessels which can enter Moneypoint is 150,000 to 170,000 deadweight tonnes. The marine facility at Moneypoint is designed for vessels of 250,000 deadweight tonnes.  This could be fully utilised by the development of a deepwater channel to provide access for vessels of this size.  This could cut the cost of electricity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> One could go further and bring in 400,000 tonne ships which would have an even greater impact on the cost of electricty.  I expect to have the initial review completed shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last five years, Ireland's trade with Libya has been erratic.  Our exports have fallen from £31 million in 1987 to £11 million in 1991.  In <Col N="1270" /> the intervening years, exports fluctuated between £20 million in 1988, £37 million in 1989 and £30 million in 1990.</P>
      <P>Imports on the other hand have been almost non-existent.  Except for 1987, when the import figure was £6 million in respect of oil, the following years showed nil or negligible imports.</P>
      <P>This has resulted in a balance of trade in Ireland's favour for the past five years. Specifically, for 1991, this balance was £11 million.</P>
      <P>Our exports to Libya are characterised by agricultural products.  For each of the years 1987 to 1990, the export of cattle made up almost 50 per cent of our total exports.  The other two main export product categories were food products, consisting mainly of drink concentrates and industrial machinery.</P>
      <P>The large fall off in exports as between 1990 and 1991 from £30 million to £11 million is in fact largely attributable to the absence of cattle exports during 1991 which trade ceased because of mistaken Libyan concern about BSE.  I have been advised by the Department of Agriculture and Food that while this difficulty has now been largely resolved, it has nevertheless been impossible to re-establish these traditional exports to date. However, a small number of beef consignments have recently been exported to Libya; others are expected to follow.</P>
      <P>At present, of course, our modest commercial relations with Libya are affected by recent UN and EC action concerning that country.  Against a background of non-compliance with an earlier Resolution obliging Libya to extradite two people allegedly responsible for the Lockerbie bombing, the United Nations Security Council, on 31 March, 1992, implemented Resolution 748 effective from 15 April 1992.</P>

    <P>This Resolution ordered all States to end all air services to and from Libya, to prohibit the supply of aircraft or aircraft components and related services, and banned the provision of arms and related materials of all types, including the equipment for their manufacture, as well as a number of related services.  The EC gave effect to this UN Resolution by way <Col N="1271" /> of EC Council Regulation No. 945/92 of 14 April 1992.  While this is directly binding on Ireland, it is additionally &mdash; and in keeping with traditional practice &mdash; being implemented by way of various domestic legal provisions.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Oral Question No. 30 and written Question No. 44 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any new proposal on the part of the EC Commission that the maximum price differential between member states in the price of motor cars should be 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>The EC Commission issued guidelines on this matter in 1985.  These guidelines, in the form of a Commission notice, related to Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 123/85 of 12 December 1984. This Regulation provides for a block exemption of certain agreements in relation to motor vehicle distribution and servicing from the provisions of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.  The Regulation entered into force on 1 July 1985 and expires on 30 June 1995.</P>
      <P>At the request of certain sectors involved and as a guideline to the Regulation, the Commission published a notice in January 1985 which set out some of the conditions by which agreements would be assessed.</P>
      <P>In the notice the Commission indicated that, for the time being, certain circumstances would not of themselves justify an investigation of whether an agreement exempted by Regulation (EEC) No. 123/85 is incompatible with the conditions of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty.  One of those circumstances would be where recommended net prices for sales to private consumers of a motor vehicle in one Member State and of the same or a corresponding motor vehicle in another Member State differed by not more than 12 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is that the Commission Vice President, Sir Leon Brittan, was commenting on a Commission report on intra-Community car price differentials which was published on 6 May 1992.  The report was produced in the <Col N="1274" /> context of complaints made to the Commission about unjustified price differentials for new cars between Member States.  The complaints claimed that this situation was the consequence of Regulation 123/85.  In their report the Commission state that Ireland was excluded from the study because of the small size of the market.</P>
    <P>I have no function in the administration of Regulation 123/85, which is solely a matter for the EC Commission. Accordingly, I do not propose to take any action on foot of the Commission's study.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first and second part of the Deputy's Question I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I made to Parliamentary Questions in this House on Thursday, 5 March 1992 (Dáil Debates, Volume 416 No. 8 Columns 1751-1766).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, along with Spain, Portugal and Greece, originally sought special transitional periods for implementation <Col N="1276" /> of the Second non-life services Directive, which excluded motor liability insurance. The special transitional periods allowed, effectively, for certain risks, a delay of six years for the liberalisation of large risk insurance business.  The Motor Insurance services Directive which is due to be implemented in Ireland shortly also contains the same transitional periods.</P>
    <P>I should point out that with regard to the Second non-life services Directive, after consultation with all interested parties and, in view of our commitment to a single insurance markets, the hope of increased competition for the benefit of consumers and increased opportunities for insurers here, I decided to waive the special transitional periods and to implement that Directive in full.  I will shortly be making a decision on the adoption or otherwise of the transitional periods available under the Motor Insurance services Directive.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that both of these Directives will be supplanted by the Third non-life Insurance framework Directive which will complete the liberalisation of cross-border non-life insurance business, including motor, and allow Irish consumers a greater choice of insurer throughout the Community.  The Directive is expected to come into effect in July, 1994 and Ireland has sought no special transitional arrangements in relations to its implementation.</P>
    <P>At present there are no applications from non-established motor insurers to offer motor insurance cover in Ireland. It remains to be seen how many such motor insurers will apply once the Motor Insurance services Directive is implemented.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the IDA's responsibility for the promotion of industrial development in Ireland is vitally important in terms of its impact on employment creation and on our economic growth generally.  Its 1992 <Col N="1278" /> grant-in-aid, which covers all administration, promotion and development costs has, because of ongoing Exchequer constraints, already been reduced below the 1991 figure and the 1992 allocation is required in full to meet this year's commitments.  A transfer of resources on the lines suggested by the Deputy is, therefore, out of the question.</P>
      <P>As to the subject of embassies in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, this is, of course, a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I should point out, however, that there is already a residential Irish Embassy in Poland.</P>
      <P>In all the three countries, An Bord Tráchtála is already represented and I can assure the Deputy that our trade and commercial interests are currently being promoted with vigour.  In fact, having visited all three countries concerned and witnessed, at first hand, the activities of An Bord Tráchtála's representatives on the ground, I can say with complete confidence that the personnel involved have done a remarkable job in a very short space of time.  Their efforts have helped to increase Irish service activities in these markets, to diversify our manufacturing exports there and to develop joint venture activities.</P>
      <P>As regards the general questions of whether &mdash; and, if so, how &mdash; our trade and commercial interests might be better advances by our Embassies, I propose to await the relevant deliberations of the Task Force set up to advise on the implementation of the Culliton recommentations, before coming to any firm views in this area.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's Question refers to State aid paid to manufacturing industry.  In an EC context the most comprehensive source of comparative data available on the volume of State aids on offer are EC Commission surveys published in 1989 and 1990 and which covered the periods 1981-1985 and 1986-1988 respectively.  A third survey, covering the period 1989-1990 is currently being complied by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The 1986-1988 Survey shows that the Yearly Averages of Total aids to manufacturing in those years in the Community as a whole was 33,714 MECU (approximately IR£26 billion).</P>

    <P>Three of the most developed Member States (Germany, France and Italy) accounted for close on 70 per cent of this, with the UK accounting for a further 10 per cent.  Consequently, Ireland's primary objective in so far as State aids is concerned is to see a reduction in the level and availability of State aids in the richer countries, both to make our aids more attractive by comparison and to allow us to minimise the cost of our aids to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Culliton Review Group recommended that we take a more pro-active role towards achieving this objective and my Department is currently considering ways of giving effect to this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Until July, 1989 there were two regional branches of the Director's Office operating in Cork and Galway, each staffed by one Inspector.  However, a decision was taken by the predecessor of the current Director, who is independent <Col N="1281" /> in the performance of his functions, to transfer the regional Inspectors to headquarters in Dublin.  This decision was taken in the interests of operational efficiency and optimum deployment of resources.  The decision was also influenced by the fact that the Director considered the operation of regional offices, in the circumstances which prevailed at that time, to be limited in their effectiveness.</P>
    <P>If the Director eventually puts forward proposals for the re-opening of regional offices the matter will be considered as sympathetically as possible, taking due account of prevailing budgetary constraints.</P>

The Government's Programme for Industrial Developments 1989-93, which is supported by EC structural funds and which was placed in the Oireachtas Library on 23 January, 1990, contains a number of sub-programmes specifically directed to develop small and medium-sizes industry.</P>

      <P>Ireland's trade with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has traditionally been low.  The bureaucratic restrictions of the old centralised system and hard currency shortages have been the major cause of Irish exporters' lack of interest in the region.</P>
      <P>With the collapse of State-trading systems, Central and Eastern Europe is likely, in the medium to long term, to provide a significant market for Irish goods and services.  From a strategic planning viewpoint, we cannot afford to ignore the opportunities involved.  Now is the time to start building economic links with the countries of the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past two years An Bord Tráchtála has established offices in Warsaw, Budapest and Prague.  These offices have played a major role in servicing <Col N="1284" /> the growing Irish interest in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>Also, in co-operation with An Bord, my Department pay particular attention at EC level to developments in Central and Eastern Europe and actively seek to promote links with the region.</P>
    <P>In furtherance of this policy, I led Trade Missions during 1991 and 1992 to Poland, Hungary and CSFR.  The Minister for Trade and Marketing also led a Mission to Russia and the Ukraine in March and is due to lead one to Hungary this month.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis of these missions has been on promoting Irish capabilities in consultancy and services.  There are enormous and immediate possibilities for the export of Irish expertise to Central and Eastern Europe.  In fact, I would see the consultancy and services sectors as providing the bridgehead for building our economic links with the region.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I am glad to say that there already is, amongst key decision-makers in Central and Eastern Europe, a rapidly growing awareness of Ireland as a source of high-quality expertise. Ireland's experience of economic transformation over the past 30 years is actively acknowledged in such quarters as being of major relevance to the needs of their own newly emerging market economies.</P>
    <P>In practical, business terms, with growing awareness of the relevance of both Irish experience and expertise has already been reflected in the involvement of an increasing number of Irish firms in multi-lateral funded projects in Eastern Europe.  This is the starting point from which, I am confident, further links will grow.</P>

      <P>The Commitment of Community funding under the Community Support Framework for Ireland 1989-1993 amounts to £2.86 billion (1989 prices).  Additional assistance under Community Initiatives has brought the total commitment to Ireland to over £3 billion.  A total of £888 million in EC aid has been made available under the Industry and Services Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>The Community Support Framework is being implemented through twelve sectoral operational Programmes, a small number of previously approved programmes and a number of community-wide measures under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF).  There are also ten Operational Programmes under Community Initiatives.</P>
      <P>These Operational Programmes specify in detail the particular development measures being undertaken, the level of EC and national funding available and the general criteria governing the provision of grant assistance to Irish enterprises.  Lead Government Departments are charged with responsibility for implementing these operational programmes in association with the State agencies and bodies coming within their aegis.</P>
      <P>Those wishing to pursue development proposals or ideas should contact the relevant Government Department or State agency where full details of the levels of grant assistance and eligibility criteria are available.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 and 62 together.  As regards Customs and Excise officials I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a previous question on this issue &mdash; Dáil Report Vol. 416 No. 6, 3 March 1992, Cols. 1062-1069 refers.  The ultimate aim is to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, a career is provided for all Customs and Excise staff in, or close to, their present locations.</P>
      <P>On the questions of assisting customs clearance agents to adopt to the Single Market, a Commission Communications was presented to the Internal Market Council on 14 May and to the ECOFIN Council on 19 May by the Commissioner Scrivener.  The purpose of this communications was to present to Council guidelines for dealing with the situation and details of the measures that the Commission proposes talking to complement those taken by the customs clearance sector itself and by Member States.  The Commission takes the line that it is primarily up to the sector itself and the Member States to take the necessary social and economics measures.  However, in the light of a recent study carried out in all twelve Member States, the Commission has decided that there is a need for Community back-up measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission suggests that these measures should be channelled through three different instruments: the European Social Fund, the INTERREG Initiative and certain <i>ad hoc</i> measures not eligible for Structural Fund Support. However, it is envisaged that ESF and INTERREG support would come from the existing Structural Fund allocations rather than additional funding.  The Commission are proposing that ECU 2 million be made available from the 1992 Budget and they will propose the inclusion of ECU 30 million in the 1993 Budget for special measures to assist customs clearance agents falling outside the scope of the Structural Funds.  The aim would be to complement members states efforts to <Col N="1290" /> help the sector's worst-hit workers and firms.  The Commission will before the end of July propose legislation on the ad hoc measures.</P>
    <P>While the Commission proposals are welcome, they do not provide for an increase in resources for action funded by the ESF or by INTERREG.  Funds under the ESF and the INTERREG Initiative are already heavily committed.</P>
    <P>My Department will be consulting with the Departments primarily concerned on follow-up to the Commission's proposals.</P>

      <P>Since taking over the canals from CIE in 1986 most of the resources available to the Office of Public Works have been required for urgent engineering works to safeguard the fabric of the system and it has not been possible to carry out all of the substantial environmental works which are necessary to upgrade the entire canal network as an attractive public amenity.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless significant improvements have been carried out in this area.  The Office of Public Works now have a regular litter collection and grass-cutting regime in place which has significantly improved the appearance of the area, about 100 trees were planted, this stretch of canal has been stocked with fish and fishing here has now become very popular. Earlier this year the Office of Public Works had a large unsightly advertising hoarding at Blackhorse Bridge removed. A path is being laid, which when completed over the next few weeks, will provide an attractive surface for pedestrians and cyclists.</P>

      <P>Teachers and instructors are engaged in <Col N="1302" /> two areas i.e. (i) education and work-training for offenders within the prisons, and (ii) in-service training to members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>(i)  The Prisons Education Service is staffed by teachers (equivalent to 129 wholetime) supplied by the Department of Education through Vocational Education Committees.  These teachers provide a wide curriculum ranging from basic literacy and numeracy to higher academic subjects, arts and crafts, physical, vocational and social education.  The salaries of these teachers is approximately £2 million per annum.  Other agencies such as the public libraries, third-level institutions and the Arts Council also contribute to prison education.  The direct cost of lecturers' fees, materials and equipment for educational activities paid for from the Prison Vote was £430,000 in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Work-Training service in the prisons provides tuition and experience for offenders in a broad range of activities, including training in industrial and technical skills.  A total of 116 staff are employed in the service, all of whom are members of the prison service.  Expenditure on Work-Training in 1991 was as follows:</P>

    <P>These costs were offset to a degree by receipts from the sale of produce and from grants from the European Social Fund, which came to £0.64 million in 1991.</P>
    <P>(ii)  In relation to the Garda Síochána, the Garda authorities inform me that there are 161 members of the Force engaged in full-time instructional duties. The work in which they are involved covers all aspects of Garda training and development.  In addition, there are two civilian Irish language teachers based at the Garda College in Templemore.  The cost of providing these services in 1992 is approximately £3,430,000.</P>

      <P>It would be contrary to long established practice and, I am satisfied, inappropriate for me as Minister for Justice to deal at Question Time with individual petitions for the remission or mitigation of penalties.  I would not, therefore, feel able either to treat a parliamentary question as a petition for such remission or to <Col N="1304" /> offer comments on the merits or otherwise of an individual case which might be the subject of a petition in the normal way.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy lodges a petition in the normal way, it will, of course, be processed.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a centralised scheme for admission to postprimary schools in September 1992 is being operated by the school authorities in Limerick city.  While I understand that maintenance of the principle of parental choice is a prime object of the centralised scheme, it must be accepted that, in a catchment area such as Limerick city, where there are a number of postprimary schools, not every pupil will obtain a place in his/her first choice school.  My Department's overall responsibility is to ensure that all the schools have, between them, adequate provision to meet demand and I am satisfied that this applies in Limerick city.</P>

      <P>In the case of community and comprehensive schools the appointment of caretakers is subject to the approval of my Department.  In the vast majority of cases where vacancies arise following retirement in authorised posts, approval is granted to the school in question to fill the vacancy.  However, in a small number of cases my Department reserve the right to allocate posts to other schools where a greater need may exist for caretaking services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of vocational schools, caretakers are approved by my Department on a scheme by scheme basis.  In general, vocational education committees are allowed to fill authorised posts due to retirement and it is a matter for the individual vocational education committee to deploy its caretaking resources in the <Col N="1310" /> manner which the vocational education committee considers best for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The voluntary secondary schools are privately managed institutions and the employment of caretakers is a matter for the individual school authorities.</P>
    <P>National schools which currently employ full-time caretakers under the existing Department scheme are entitled to recruit temporary replacements for key posts which become vacant, pending the introduction of a new scheme for the provision of caretaking services.</P>
    <P>In future the employment of caretakers funded by the Department in primary and secondary schools will be governed by the terms of a new scheme to expand caretaking services in these schools. Under the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> this scheme will be introduced on a phased basis commencing in September next and will be applied progressively to national schools with 100 pupils upwards and to secondary schools with 200 pupils upwards.</P>

      <P>On foot of the Government decision that a £3 million levy be paid by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to the Exchequer the Government decided that the annual increase in maintenance charges will not be applied to charges for semi-private and private beds in public hospitals before mid-1993.  This will be of benefit both to the VHI and to its <Col N="1318" /> members as an increase in hospital maintenance charges would normally lead to a higher increase in premiums.  On the basis of an increase similar to that applied from last August the decision to defer the mid-1992 increase in charges is estimated to save the VHI £3 million in a full year. Therefore the levy will not have an adverse effect on premium levels paid by VHI members.</P>

Hours of attendance and other conditions of service such as pay, sick leave, annual leave, and so on are based on 50 per cent of the amount applicable in the case of a full-time person in the same grade.  This scheme affords flexibility to staff and to management in providing an alternative to traditional full-time working arrangements.</P>

      <P>It is not appropriate that I should refer to individual details about the person referred to in my reply.  I will communicate separately with the Deputy on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy that the improvement of services to people with mental handicap is one of my main priorities. It is the policy of my Department that persons with mental handicap should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be treated in any other way.  The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services endorses this policy.  It recommends that an assessment be carried out of the circumstances and needs of each person with mental handicap in a psychiatric hospital.  If the assessment indicates that it would be inappropriate to transfer the person, he or she will continue to be cared for in the psychiatric services in de-designated accommodation in as homely an environment as possible.  If the <Col N="1323" /> assessment indicates that the person with mental handicap no longer needs care in a psychiatric setting, the report recommends that he or she should transfer to a mental handicap service.</P>
    <P>My Department has appointed an adviser with expertise in the care of persons with mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals to work with the the health boards and voluntary agencies to prepare a programme to provide better services for people with mental handicap in the psychiatric hospitals which will be agreed before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Following consultations with the Department of Health and the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK in 1990, manufacturers of tampons agreed voluntarily to put a statement on the packaging concerning the proper use of these products.

The Association of Sanitary Protection Manufacturers (UK) has issued guidelines in the matter to its members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and the new Regulations under the Act, will establish a new legal framework for the regulation of nursing homes by health boards and a new system for the payment of subvention to dependent persons in care in nursing homes.  Four sets of detailed regulations have to be drafted under the Act before it can be implemented.  Two sets of draft regulations &mdash; the Care and Welfare Regulations, which deal with the standards of accommodation and care in nursing homes, and the Boarding Out Regulations, which set out the conditions for boarding out under the new legislation, have already been agreed with nursing home interests and groups representing the elderly.</P>
      <P>Two further sets of Regulations have to be finalised before the new Nursing Homes Act can be implemented.  These are the Nursing Home Subvention Regulations and the Nursing Home Fees Regulations.  The drafting of these Regulations is at an advanced stage.  It is my intention to begin discussions on these Regulations with nursing home interests and groups representing the elderly as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that the current system of subvention is unsatisfactory as patients in some nursing homes are not entitled to receive a subvention under existing arrangements.  This is the case for some private nursing homes in all health board regions, including the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> The new Nursing Homes Act and Regulations address the problem of providing for a more equitable system of subventing nursing home care based on an assessment of the means and dependency of the elderly person.  One of the principal objectives of the new legislation is to provide for the payment of subvention to any registered nursing homes according to standard criteria.  The new legislation provides that patients who qualify for a nursing home subvention may choose which registered nursing home to enter.  Any nursing home which meets the standards of accommodation and care under the new regulations will be registered by the health board.  In this way, the inequities in the current system of subvention will be removed.  The new system of subvention will be implemented by all health boards including the Mid-Western Health Board at the same time.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring the new nursing homes legislation into effect as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The special Housing Aid Scheme for the Elderly was established in 1982 to carry out repairs to houses of elderly people in unfit and insanitary conditions.  Health boards have established <i>ad hoc</i> committees to run the scheme, comprising representatives of the boards, the local authorities, voluntary bodies and FÁS, where they are involved in carrying out work under the scheme.  The scheme is overseen at national level by a Task Force on which the Departments of the Environment and Health, the local authorities and voluntary bodies are represented. Since it was established, expenditure on <Col N="1331" /> the scheme has been over £8 million and 10,000 elderly households have been assisted under the scheme to carry out work.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board have informed me that at 1 December 1991, 209 applications for aid under the scheme had been approved.  On the trend of previous years, it would be expected that about half of these applications will be dealt with this year.

      <P>The information sought, in so far as it is available in the Department, in relation to the refurbishment of the Darndale estate is being compiled and will be sent to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The allocations made to Dublin Corporation under the remedial works scheme total £25.306 million.  This includes £5.6 million for 1992 &mdash; some 40 per cent of the total available.</P>
      <P>The planning and carrying out of remedial works to their dwellings are matters for Dublin Corporation who are also responsible for the apportionment of their annual capital allocation between their housing estates designated for funding under the remedial works scheme. The normal practice in refurbishment projects is for work to be carried out on a phased basis.</P>

This authorisation is qualified to the extent that the sign may be provided only where an adult or junior school warden service operates, or where a local authority is satisfied, following consultation with the Garda that safety factors including prevailing traffic conditions deem it necessary. The decision to erect a sign in any specific location is a matter for the local authority, acting with the consent of the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <P>My Department carry out testing for hormones and other illegal substances at factories as part of an EC random testing programme.  A specified number of samples in the case of each one of a number of particular substances is selected and tested annually on a random basis.  Where carcases are found to be positive, investigations are extended to the farm of origin.</P>
      <P>This random testing is supplemented by sampling of animals presented for slaughter where there are grounds for suspicion that there has been illegal administration of substances because of, for example, the animal's conformation or the detection of implants or injection sites.  Where the test result proves positive, the meat or meat product derived from the animal is deemed to be unfit for human consumption.  The legal basis for this procedure is the European Communities (Control of Veterinary Medicinal Products and Their Residues) Regulations, 1988 and 1990.</P>
      <P>All samples from slaughtered animals are placed in tamperproof containers and transported to an official testing laboratory by a means which will ensure that they will not be damaged or delayed.  On each container is noted the code number for the sample, the factory carcase number to enable the herd or flock of origin to be identified, the species and sex of the animal, the date the sample was taken and the name and address of the establishment at which the sample was taken.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a Free Telephone Rental Allowance in March 1991.  One of the conditions for receipt of the allowance is that the applicant must reside alone or with other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon help in the event of an emergency. The allowance may also be payable where children under 15 years are part of the household and the other conditions are fulfilled.</P>
      <P>The person concerned resides with her husband and it is understood that he is not incapacitated.  In these circumstances the household would not qualify for a Free Telephone Rental Allowance.  The application by the person concerned was therefore rejected, and the claimant was notified of this decision early in April 1991.</P>
      <P>The person concerned receives Invalidity Pension and her spouse is in receipt of long term Unemployment Assistance. They also receive increases for their dependent children.  In total, the couple are currently receiving a total of £157.60 per week in social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 188 and 191 together.</P>
      <P>Persons in receipt of an income by way of pension or otherwise from here or abroad may be entitled to a non-contributory Old Age Pension as a supplement to the other income where their total means are below the means limits for the non-contributory pension.  The rate of the non-contributory pension varies with the amount of the other income and persons in these circumstances are obliged to inform the Department of any increase in their means and to have their pension adjusted accordingly.</P>
      <P>To ensure that these requirements are being met, the Department periodically reviews the means of non-contributory Old Age Pensioners.  On a recent review of 8,657 such pensioners, 6,490 had their pensions reduced because of increases in their British Retirement Pension since 1985, 128 had them revoked, 27 were awarded increased pensions and 951 recipients were unaffected.</P>
      <P>Approximately 1,300 of these recipients live in County Donegal, and to date, 1,243 have had their income reassessed. Details of the effects of the reassessments on these recipients are not separately available.</P>
      <P>The rules relating to the assessment of means are set out in Social Welfare legislation and the Department has no discretion in cases of this nature. However, if the persons concerned are dissatisfied with their means assessments, it is open to them to apply to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office for a further review.</P>

      <P>The person concerned originally applied for an Old Age Contributory Pension in November 1985.  His application was rejected at the time as he <Col N="1348" /> had insufficient insurance contributions to qualify him for this type of pension.</P>
      <P>However, following an investigation of his means, he was awarded an Old Age Non-Contributory Pension at the maximum rate with effect from November 1985.  This pension currently amounts to £83 per week inclusive of an Adult Dependant Allowance in respect of his spouse.</P>
      <P>The pensioner's entitlement to a <i>Pro Rata</i> Old Age Contributory Pension under EC regulations was examined in 1986.  This pension is based upon a combination of his Irish and UK insurance contributions.  It was decided that, while he would qualify for this type of pension, the rate of payment to which he would have been entitled was significantly less than that which he was receiving in Old Age Non-Contributory Pension.  Both pensions could not be paid concurrently and the non-contributory pension remains in payment as it was more financially beneficial to him.  The rate of pension payable to him now falls to be reviewed in the light of the amount of British Retirement Pension also in payment to him.</P>
      <P>There is no record of an application for Old Age Non-Contributory Pension having been received from the pensioner's spouse.  An application form issued to her recently.  As soon as this is completed and returned to the Department, her entitlement to pension will be investigated.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to (a) the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15 who was awarded a carer's allowance and who now finds that the mortgage assistance received was reduced by a similar amount leaving them no better off and (b) the trap this family is in as set out in a letter (details supplied); if he will make a statement on this trap in which so many people on social welfare are prevented from in any way improving their lot; and if he will outline the changes he proposes to make.</Quest>

      <P>There is provision under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for assistance to be given to people towards mortgage interest payments, on a similar basis to assistance with rent payments.  As in the case of rent supplements, mortgage interest supplements are calculated so as to leave the claimants with an income, after payment of mortgage interest, of the appropriate Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for their family size less £3.50.</P>
      <P>Supplements paid under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme are recalculated to take account of any change in the household income of claimants. The husband of the person referred to by the Deputy had been in receipt of a mortgage interest supplement in the amount of £56.30 per week at end March 1992 in addition to his Long Term Unemployment Assistance payment of £123.80 per week.  Following the award of a Carer's Allowance to his wife, his mortgage interest supplement has to be recalculated in line with the regulations governing the scheme.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy arises because of the different rates of payment under different social welfare schemes.  It is my intention to rationalise the present system so as to achieve a more standardised approach to income support for persons dependent on the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>Regulation 9 of the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) Regulations, 1980 (S.I.
