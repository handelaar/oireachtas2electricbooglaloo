      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 19 and 20.  It is also proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the Order of Business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m.  The proceedings of the Report and Final Stages of Nos. 19 and 20 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. respectively by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for Education, Private Members' Business shall be No. 26 and shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that business be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 19 and 20 satisfactory and agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I protest at the way in which these two measures are being guillotined.  It appears to be the policy of this Government to guillotine all legislation going through the House.  Not alone are those two Bills being guillotined today but they were also guillotined on Committee Stage.  I see the Whip passing <Col N="1994" /> the Taoiseach a note pointing out the number of hours and the number of amendments and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Correctly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but that does not fool me.  The Committee Stages of these Bills were guillotined and now the Report Stage is being guillotined even though there are a considerable number of amendments down.  We are not accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the taking of these Bills in this manner.  It is rather ironic that we are taking these Bills in this haphazard manner at a time when we have published the Green Paper on Education.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Education might accept my suggestion that it would be far more constructive if these Bills were put back until the autumn in the context of the debate on the Green Paper.  Forty amendments to the original Bill were drafted and put in at short notice.  There has not been adequate time for debate and that is not in the best interest of education.</P>

      <P>I am sure everyone, including the Taoiseach, must be weary of the litany of complaint about how legislation is dealt with in this House.  It is time the House put itself in order and found a way to deal adequately with important Bills.  We object to the way in which these important Bills are being dealt with.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, who was in the Chamber a short time ago, to explain to the House the extraordinary delay taken by the Government in producing the document circulated in our post this morning called the &ldquo;Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1991&rdquo; taking into consideration the fact that it makes virtually no advance on the general law with regard to the availability of contraceptives.  Could the Taoiseach offer some explanation to the House as to why the legislation has taken a year to be produced and yet we have been presented with such a Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, could I raise the matter of the answerability in this House of the Minister for Energy on issues relating to the supply of natural gas?  I point out to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that one month ago the Minister for Energy accepted and replied to a question asked by me in this House about the supply of natural gas in Tallaght; yet he and his Department yesterday turned down a request to discuss that matter on the Adjournment.  How are we ordering our business in this House when the Minister does answer a question yet refuses to accept that it can be discussed on the Adjournment?</P>

      <P>It is a matter on the Order of Business that concerns the ordering of business of this House.  It is a matter as to whether or not those issues are dealt with by the Minister.  On the one hand, four weeks ago he answered a question on the subject, and on the other hand yesterday he refused to accept an adjournment debate on the most important issue of the supply of natural gas to one of the major estates in Tallaght.</P>

      <P>I understand that last week it was decided that the Roads Bill on Committee Stage would be referred to a Select Committee.  You may recall that I asked the Taoiseach at that stage if he would inquire as to whether adequate resources would be made available through the Houses of the Oireachtas to staff and report the proceedings of that Select Committee.  I wonder whether the Taoiseach is now in a position to confirm that that Select Committee can commence their work and that the proceedings will be adequately reported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>Before proceeding on this, let me advise the House of a typographical error in respect of amendment No. 72 in the name of an tAire Oideachais on the green list of amendments dated 1 July 1992.  The reference to the Vocational Education Act, 1980 should read &ldquo;Vocational Education Act, 1930&rdquo;.  Replace 1980 with 1930.  The first amendment in the names of Deputy J. Higgins and Deputy Therese Ahearn is out of order.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 20, to delete &ldquo;applies&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;applies and, in relation to the Regional Technical College Cork, includes a school of that College established as such under section 3 (1) (b)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage Deputy O'Shea said that a definition of the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; used in this Bill was necessary. The amendment expands the definition of &ldquo;college&rdquo; to include the schools covered by this Bill, that is, the Cork School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design which are established at section 3 (1) (b) as schools of the regional technical college, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment provides for the extension of the definition of &ldquo;college&rdquo; to include, in the case of the Cork regional technical college, the School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design.  The amendment is tabled in <Col N="2007" /> response to a concern expressed on Committee Stage as to what exactly a school is in terms of this Bill and the view that a definition was required.  We are now doing that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for responding to the point made on Committee Stage.  However, the amendment does not define a school.  It incorporates the school with a regional college but does no give a definition of &ldquo;school&rdquo;. Further to that point, what is the present status of the heads of schools as in the two colleges in Cork?  In the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill the terms &ldquo;president&rdquo; and &ldquo;director&rdquo; are used. What term will now apply to the head of a school in Cork?  Does the Minister envisage any addition to define those positions?  What will be the exact status of those positions?</P>

We do so on the basis that there is a clearly established need for such colleges and on the basis of a very strong recommendation made on behalf of such colleges in a document published in November 1991 &mdash; the Commission of European Communities' Memorandum on Higher Education in the European Community.  That document sets down in the clearest possible terms the desirability from the point of view of regional development, of establishing regional colleges.  The nine areas which have had the benefit of regional colleges since their establishment back in the sixties will testify to the impetus they have given to the development of their regions.  The strong endorsement and recommendations in the document call for a very clear policy statement.</P>

Every September there is a mass exodus of over 2,000 students from Mayo to the nine colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities.  I will briefly quote what the European Commission said in this regard:</P>
      <P>The very presence of a higher education institute in a region represents an investment around which a number of services will grow.  It makes an area attractive for investment on account of the availability of highly trained manpower so necessary to the success of modern enterprise.

      <P>Amendments which were circulated on 11 December 1991 provided for the inclusion of elected local representatives in the vocational education committee nominees.  Concern was expressed on Committee Stage that this would preclude the inclusion of co-opted members of authorities.

The phrase &ldquo;members of local authorities&rdquo; was also inserted in section 6 on Committee Stage.

      <P>In page 4, line 30, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the vocational education committee&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> On Committee Stage of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill I accepted an amendment from Deputies Higgins and Ahearn to the effect that whenever the Minister or the vocational education committee consider that any other institution, or part of an institution, should be incorporated in the institute the Minister may by order take the necessary action. I also undertook at that stage to consider a corresponding amendment for Report Stage of this Bill.  Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are the result of this undertaking.</P>
    <P>I should tell the House that yesterday evening I met with representatives of the IVEA who made a strong case in favour of changing the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; to &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  They put it to me that it was extremely important that this change be made to ensure that the agreement of both the Minister and the vocational education committee would be required before this Bill could be applied to other institutions.  As I have agreed to their strong request I am now putting forward this amendment to include the words &ldquo;and the vocational education committee&rdquo;.  This means, in effect, that in this area the Minister will only be able to act with the agreement of the vocational education committee. Before the Bill can be applied to other institutions the agreement of both the Minister and the vocational education committee will be required.</P>
    <P>The reason I have put this amendment forward is that I wish to clarify that it is my intention to define an appropriate role for the vocational education committees. In response to their strongly stated wish I am now prepared to make this change, which is of importance to them.  I accept their good intentions and would like to take this opportunity to thank them for a frank and fruitful meeting.</P>
    <P>I trust that this amendment, which has been accepted, taken in conjunction with the other significant changes I have introduced, clarifies that it is my intention to ensure that the vocational education committees have an appropriate role, which can be debated during the next few months in the context of the Green <Col N="2012" /> Paper.  We will have to discuss the question of the future of the structures of the vocational education committees and I look forward to that debate.  As I said, I am putting this amendment forward at the direct request of the IVEA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me welcome the reversal of throttle on the part of the Minister in this regard.  During the course of the debate on Committee Stage we were strong advocates of the role of the vocational education committees.  In the Minister's absence a substantial list of amendments was circulated as the debate was about to begin which plucked out the reference to the vocational education committees, neutralised their role and culled their activities in respect of vocational education.  This was the bone of contention.  We made a strong and impassioned plea that these amendments should not be proceeded with.</P>
      <P>It is obvious however that political pressure pays &mdash; the three Ps.  It is obvious also that the IVEA and the respective vocational education committees around the country, many of which are dominated by the Minister's party colleagues, got on their telephones and bicycles and started to lobby politically. They sent a clear message to the Minister that the references to the vocational education committees, who have done a lot of work in pioneering vocational and technical education, should not be deleted.  That is the reason I welcome the rehabilitation of the vocational education committees in the two sectors referred to in the amendment. I cannot for the life of me understand the reason, given that reference was made to them in the original Bill, they were excluded on Committee Stage. It is necessary to include a reference to them.  I am glad, therefore, that there has been a Pauline conversion and the Minister is now back on side.</P>

    <P>Let me make the point again, in recognising the role of the vocational education committees, that we are about to discuss as part of the great national debate the Minister's document <i>Education for a Changing World.</i> The reason <Col N="2013" /> we need such a document is that during the years education has been identified with social policy while little or no legislation has been passed.  For example, apart from the School Attendance Act, there is no legislation governing primary legislation; the system is based on the Stanley letter which was issued in the 1830's.  Neither is there any legislation governing second level education, apart from the Intermediate Act, 1924.  Much has happened in the meantime.  We have now free education and community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there is no legislation governing the regional technical colleges. They are based on the one solid piece of legislation we have, the 1930 Vocational Education Committee Act, which has given rise to vocational schools, technical schools, night schools and the regional technical colleges and has stood the test of time.  Yet, in one fell swoop the vocational education committees were virtually written out.  Therefore, I do not blame Mr. Seán Conway, the IVEA or its members for feeling intense hurt last week when they realised that all of a sudden their contribution to vocational education was being thrown overboard. I am glad the Minister has recanted and has agreed to insert these two amendments. Later, we will ask him to reinsert the reference to the vocational education committees in those sections of the Bill where it was deleted.</P>
    <P>I should say that it is sensible to include these sections, particularly in the light of the insertion of the reference to the vocational education committees. Section 3 (2), which is being amended will, now read as follows: &ldquo;whenever the Minister and the vocational education committee consider that this Act should apply to any other educational institution...&rdquo; Therefore what the Minister is doing is recognising the right of the vocational education committees to determine if there is a clear need to establish new regional technical colleges in areas such as Castlebar and Thurles.  Not only is he enshrining this right in the legislation but he is defining their role and obligation to be aware of changing <Col N="2014" /> circumstances in an area which will give rise to such a development.  As I said, I am glad the Minister has at this stage before the House passes the Bill agreed to enshrine the right of the vocational education committees in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should say to the Minister that his Department have received a strong letter from County Mayo Vocational Education Committee and other associated vocational education committees in the western region which highlights the need to establish a regional technical college in the county.  This section will enable County Galway Vocational Education Committee, for example, to say that they would have no objections if a sister college is established in County Mayo, that there is a need for a better spread of resources in the west and that they recognise the right of the people of County Mayo to have their own college.  Therefore, if the City of Galway Vocational Education Committee, County Galway Vocational Education Committee or any other associated vocational education committee within that catchment area write to the Department it is clear that they will be exercising their right as enshrined in this Bill.  I am glad the Minister has agreed to table this amendment and has decided on his own initiative to reinsert the reference to the role of the vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister for tabling these two amendments. The role of the vocational education committees has been decimated in relation to these colleges.

      <P>I, too, welcome the amendment; but, if we are to be truthful, we expected it, given the wrath and anger expressed by the vocational education committees and the members of the IVEA.  They compelled the Minister to reinsert the reference to the vocational education committees in this section. <Col N="2015" /> Nevertheless, I should point out that we argued in favour of this on Committee Stage, but unfortunately the Minister did not accept our arguments at that time. We argued that the vocational education committees should have a say in relation to the need to establish educational establishments in the future.</P>
      <P>The two vocational education committees in County Tipperary, both north and south, have identified the need to establish a third-level college in Thurles. Not only have these two committees made the case for a regional technical college but they have also made the case for a rural and business institute.  This was a role taken by the local vocational education committees, where they identified a need for expansion in third level education in rural studies relating to the agricultural and food industries, and they outlined that these particular areas of education were not being catered for in any of the other regional colleges.  The input and the proposals put forward by both North and South Tipperary vocational education committees are proof of the input the vocational education committee can have in outlining the need for third level education and indicating where regional technical colleges should be established.  As I have said, rural and business studies are areas where further courses should be provided. Tipperary, which is the second largest county in Ireland, does not have a third level education college.  The evidence of this can be seen every weekend when droves of students leave for outlying counties in order to receive third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadder still, on a recent review we have not emerged well from our participation in third level education.  I understand we are one of the fourth worst participants due entirely to the lack of availability of third level education facilities within the county.  In County Tipperary we have not only identified the need for a college but also specified the areas of need which are rural and business studies and this is indeed proof that vocational education committees should be reinserted into this <Col N="2016" /> part of the Bill.  It is unfortunate that the vocational education committees which had been successful, were then omitted and now, because of pressure, have been reinstated.  It was a poor response to the immense work done by the vocational education committees to date, but I do hope that under this section of the Bill the vocational education committees will be given a real say in the location of colleges in the future and that this will lead to a third level college being established in Thurles and providing courses in both rural and business education.  I welcome the amendment but, as I pointed out, it is merely in line with what we proposed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for making this change.  On Second Stage when Deputy O'Rourke was Minister, I and other Deputies raised this issue on these two sections and I tabled an amendment to delete &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;the vocational education committee&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;whenever the vocational education committee recommends&rdquo;. At that stage the vocational education committee has some input throughout the Bill and it was a substantially different Bill in many ways. Also at that stage there were sections dealing with the local education authorities. I do not recall whether they were replacing or joining with the vocational education committees but there was a democratic element in the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it was quite a shock when the Minister proceeded to eliminate the vocational education committees throughout the Bill and made reference to &ldquo;layer of bureaucracy&rdquo;.  That was a particularly worrying and perhaps insulting phrase to people who had dedicated their lives over a number of generations to a system of education which was democratic, secular, non-denominational, non-selective, and which catered for people who were very innovative, in fact, the only innovative element in the educational system, taking into consideration the absolutely negative attitude of the Department of Education over many decades.  I am not referring <Col N="2017" /> to the Department of Education as they have operated over the past ten or 15 years, when they certainly have been much more progressive, but for decades they were a most regressive Department, while the vocational education committees played a very prominent role in developing educational systems.</P>
    <P>In recent years particularly, all the innovations and developments have been pioneered by the vocational education committees.  In addition to the pioneering work in which the curriculum development unit have been involved over the past 15 years or more, they have also been interested in various spheres of education that others totally neglected, i.e. the education of the handicapped, the education of prisoners and, of course, the development of adult education, which has progressed enormously.  They also developed the post-leaving certificate courses and expanded the scope of education to many people, particularly the disadvantaged.  The vocational education committees were the only people who gave any real help to the disadvantaged and who constantly catered for them and ensured that they received an education. Other educational institutions cast them aside; they only wanted the best, not those who had any educational difficulties. The vocational education committees welcomed these people and worked with them, which was a difficult task.  They developed a complete remedial teaching area, school psychological services, etc. because it was necessary.</P>
    <P>To discover now that all the great work of the vocational education committees was totally ignored by the Minister for Education, who regarded them as another layer of bureaucracy, was not very nice and angered people.  I said on the last occasion we debated this that I did not agree with IVEA's phraseology and references to betrayal in their letter to the Minister.  I do not agree with the use of such words but I am sure the Minister will understand their anger.  Perhaps the Minister did not see it that way when he was making that comment but it was quite hurtful.  The elimination of <Col N="2018" /> the vocational education committee system is evident in this Bill and we wondered last week whether the Green Paper would confirm that.  It was certainly evident from that document that it is intended to abolish the 1930 Act.  That was a very worrying aspect of the Green Paper because in particular the element of democracy was being eliminated from the educational system.  Also, the idea of regional and community control, and the development of the educational system in different areas with different needs and ideas, was being eliminated.</P>
    <P>To eliminate a democratic element on the basis that it is just another layer of bureaucracy is, if I may say so to the Minister, a typical dictatorial attitude, saying it is only bureaucracy: I can run this show better myself without these layers of bureaucracy.  That is the problem with democracy.  If it did not obtain the Minister would not have to waste his time here listening to Members tell him what he should be doing and so on. Democracy is all about people having their say all along the line.  It may delay things, or be annoying to somebody trying to get something done to have to listen to somebody, perhaps a county councillor or a member of a vocational education committee who thinks they know better.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the way democracy is being developed under the Green Paper on Education and this Bill is an indication of the attitude, that there will be the Department at the top and individual schools running their own shows.  I might add it is not just the fault of the Minister; this is a departmental idea. The Department want to be at the top dealing with individual schools and boards of management, with nobody in between to tell the Department anything in regard to how education should develop, what is required in this or that area, no vocational system, no local educational authorities or such bodies.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister tabled this amendment.  I hope it is an indication that he is willing to acknowledge the great achievements of the vocational education committee system if only within the <Col N="2019" /> regional technical college context.  The regional technical colleges which have been in existence for a few years have become a major regional element.  Every region wants a regional technical college because they perceive its enormous benefits to young people in the area as a means of attracting industry.  Each regional technical college developed its expertise, perhaps because of the region in which it is located, the type of industry located there, or which could be developed there and so on.  The regional technical colleges have been of enormous economic importance.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say they were restricted or constrained by the vocational education committees; far from it.  That overall development, community inspiration, emanated from the involvement of local representatives, county councillors and others, on vocational education committee boards, whether they were employers, parents, students, trade unionists.  They were all represented on vocational education committee school committees and colleges.  It has always been the trademark of the vocational education committee system that all people were represented on schools subcommittees and college boards.  That is vital.  The 1930 Act may be old but it is very flexible and, as yet, its provisions have not been used to their full potential. Only as one begins to implement its provisions does one see the enormous flexibilty that is in the 1930 Act.  If it is to be abolished I should like to see it replaced by one that would allow similar democratic, non-denominational, secular influence in the educational system, the involvement of people in the development of education in their areas and a say in the type of education they should have and want.  It is vital that the vocational education committees who built up these colleges and ensured that links prevailed between second-level schools and colleges, be maintained. That would ensure also a linkage into local communities, industries and so on. It is crucial that that linkage be maintained <Col N="2020" /> through the vocational education committee system.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, in tabling this amendment, is indicating that he will ensure that vocational education committee involvement is retained in the regional technical colleges and in the Dublin Institute of Technology constituent colleges with which we will be dealing later.  It would be my hope that their scope would be further enhanced in the future under the terms of the Green and White Papers.  What is important is that their local or regional involvement in education be extended rather than narrowed; in other words, that it be extended to the primary as well as second and third levels.</P>

      <P>I shall not detain the House and perhaps, we have spent too much time on these amendments bearing in mind that we have not reached section 13.  I hope all Members will make a real effort to deal with the next few sections quickly so that we can move to the uncharted territory of section 14.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no big deal for the Minister to have conceded to tabling this amendment.  The Minister is a man of considerable experience.  He fully understands that the constraints laid down &mdash; even by acceptance of the amendment and the inclusion of the words &ldquo;vocational education committee&rdquo;&mdash; mean that, even following consultations between his Department and a relevant vocational education committee, the consent of the Minister for Finance must be forthcoming before the First Schedule can be changed.  It is important, at least in the context of Deputy Mac Giolla's treatise on democracy, that the public understand that the Minister was sufficiently flexible to introduce this amendment. That will give a number of communities some hope, communities who have for long been harbouring a <Col N="2021" /> dream that their region or area might be included in an amended First Schedule.</P>
      <P>I have no wish to make a Second Stage speech but I am sure that, when the Minister examines the files in his Department, he will observe that there were numerous consultations, deputations and agreements between the Mayo vocational education committee and his predecessors in the Department of Education regarding the provision of a regional technical college there.  I very much regret that the First Schedule does not include Castlebar for a regional technical college.  On 17 December 1981 the then Minister, former Deputy John Boland, reiterated in this House his commitment to establish a regional technical college in Castlebar. On 17 February 1983 the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Hussey, said she was aware of her predecessor's decision and was satisfied both as to the validity and strength of the argument for the location of a regional technical college in Castlebar.</P>
      <P>On 16 May 1985 the Department of Finance issued formal sanction to commence the planning and design of Castlebar and Thurles regional technical colleges.  On 7 June 1985 the then Minister, former Deputy Hussey, gave the go-ahead for Castlebar, following which a design team comprised of architects, services engineers, structural engineers and quantity surveyors, were appointed on 28 June 1985.  The proposed college was designed to cater for an enrolment of 800 students at an estimated cost, at that time of £9 million.  I was a member of several delegations which met with the officials in the Minister's Department when a curriculum and a syllabus were agreed.  It took some considerable examination of potential sites before agreement could be reached.  On 28 January 1987, in the last days of that Coalition Government, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, formally sanctioned the provision of money to purchase a site once the relevant agreements were reached, and these agreements were reached.</P>

I have tabled a question to him for written answer and I would be very happy if he would agree to meet a formal deputation from Mayo vocational education committee which would include all the Oireachtas Members from County Mayo to clarify, in the context of this amendment, where the Minister and his Department stand on this question of the regional technical colleges.  I would add that the Minister's colleague, the present Minister for Justice, made a specific commitment on more than one occasion that third level courses would be up and running in the town by last September and this commitment has not been honoured.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would concede that.  In the context of this amended section, I hope that at long last, after a very long battle, the people of County Mayo will be given this long promised facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies for their very generous response to this amendment, which I appreciate.  Deputy Higgins tabled it on the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and used the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;and&rdquo; and we have met that requirement.  To the extent that this amendment is here, it is a credit to Deputy Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not regard it as a reversal of policy but as a sensible decision.  If the vocational education committee decided that this Colleges Bill should not be extended to other institutions, that is obviously a power that they should have. This Colleges Bill is about the regional technical colleges so when the IVEA ask that they and the Minister should be joined, as it were, in deciding whether it should be applied to other institutions, I have no difficulty with that because the Bill is really about the existing regional technical colleges.  Were one to extend it <Col N="2023" /> in a dramatic way to other institutions, the decent thing to do would be to come back to the House with a fresh Bill and extend it in that way if that was the decision of the Government of the day. I do not regard this as a reversal of direction. The direction is not to attack the vocational education committees.  The direction, as I pointed out publicly on a number of occasions since, is to give authority to the governing body of the college.  I cannot give them more authority unless I take that authority from somewhere else and I have taken it from the Minister and from the vocational education committees.  That is a very simple equation.  I have left very substantial authority with the vocational education committee throughout the Bill and have struck the Minister out of the Bill as far as I possibly can.  I am trying to get a balance here between the role of the vocational education committee and the new colleges.  The principle in this Bill seeks to define the respective roles.</P>
    <P>This is a totally new section.  Deputy Higgins is not strictly correct because it was not in the original Bill and taken out and then put back in.  It was not in the Bill in the first place but is a totally new section and, I hope, a welcome one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahearn asked about the establishment of new regional technical colleges. The Minister must make the ultimate decision in regard to any new regional technical college.  Deputy Kenny is right in saying that the Minister for Finance will want a major say in that decision.  That must be the case for budgetary reasons but the regional technical college can recommend it.  Therefore, new regional technical colleges are a matter for policy decision which are not particularly appropriate to this legislation. If they are established the Minister and the vocational education committee jointly could decide to extend this legislation to them.</P>
    <P>I have taken careful note of what Deputy Kenny said.  He is a very strong campaigner for County Mayo.  I have no doubt that what he says will be warmly supported throughout the county.  I will <Col N="2024" /> give active consideration to meeting a deputation as he has asked but I repeat that the establishment of new regional technical colleges is a matter for a Government policy decision taking into account finances, spread and so on.  I know he feels strongly about this and I will give strong consideration to his request for a meeting with a deputation.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to what Deputy Mac Giolla said, if the phrase &ldquo;layer of bureaucracy&rdquo; insulted the vocational education committees then I would regret that.  It is not my intention to insult the vocational education committees.  I have great respect for local public representatives. I think everybody in this House should have.  It is not that I am saying to the vocational education committees that I do not want a layer of bureaucracy because I can do things better myself.  What I am saying is that I do not necessarily want another organisation or group of people, but that the boards of colleges can do the job because they are there on the ground and know the college.  It is very important that we have boards of management and governing bodies who have authority and some say in developing their particular institution.  Otherwise we may as well not have them.</P>
    <P>For too long we have had a large number of governing bodies and boards of management all over the country and every time they wanted to move they have had to get on to Dublin or the vocational education committee and have been tied hand and foot.  What I am doing here is not insulting the vocational education committees, I hope, but simply asking them to share power and to trust the boards and governing bodies of these colleges.  They will have the largest single representation on the boards.  They have substantial powers retained throughout the Bill.  If one includes the five organisations which they nominate on top of their own six nominees &mdash; and I am aware that that is a thin enough argument &mdash; given that they will probably be local organisations to which they would be very close, they in fact have a majority on the boards and governing bodies of <Col N="2025" /> these colleges.  They still have a very active role.  I have tried to achieve a balance between giving the college governing body a substantial say in the day-to-day running of the institution and retaining a role for the vocational education committee in the broader democratic process.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that the Green Paper says that we have to debate the future of the vocational education committees.  I think we really have to do that.  I would suggest that they would have a very strong role in adult education in the future, in literacy programmes, in developing the role of the disadvantaged and developing programmes for the disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>The Minister was not here for Committee Stage debate when Deputy Ahearn and I very strongly advocated the need for a very hard look at the title of the colleges.  This is not to be in any way disrespectful of the role of the colleges up to now.  We did debate a number of things in relation to the number of colleges.  The Minister will recall that on the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill we spoke about the fact that the degree has an aura and a status and that we should give all the colleges degree conferring rights.  We also discussed the title of the colleges because title is important.  The term &ldquo;university&rdquo; is an internationally recognised term. The term &ldquo;regional technical college&rdquo; is our own creation, our own title for our particular localised institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know regional technical colleges do tremendous work but in many cases it has to be explained what they are about.  When one has to explain what an institution do it diminishes their status.  We advocated the replacement of the term &ldquo;regional technical college&rdquo; with the internationally recognised term &ldquo;regional polytechnic college&rdquo;.  We did this on the basis that the word &ldquo;technical&rdquo; has second level education connotations &mdash; for example, technical schools and technical subjects &mdash; and that regional technical colleges have grown outside the ambit of technical colleges, they are polytechnic, all-embracing colleges.  For example, they offer courses in science, technology, advanced business studies and marketing.  To do justice to these colleges and the curriculum they are advancing we should give them the all-embracing, clearly identifiable and internationally recognisable title of regional polytechnic colleges.  Many good terms are used in the Green Paper.  Some of these are &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; terms as, for example, enterprise culture.  Nowhere is this culture more in evidence than in the regional technical colleges.  They have gladly grasped that challenge and agenda and have run very strongly with it.  I ask the Minister, if he is given the opportunity to reply, to give an indication that he will <Col N="2027" /> consider this suggestion.  The Fine Gael Senators will put down an amendment in this respect when the Bill is going through the Seanad.</P>

      <Col N="2028" /> In page 5, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) the vocational education committee,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I sought an explanation of what membership of a college entailed.  It appears that membership of a college is merely an honorary position which has no legal standing and which does not confer any rights or responsibilities. Therefore, membership of a college is no big deal, so to speak.  My amendment proposes that members of a vocational education committee should be members of a college.  The spirit of goodwill which has been displayed in the debate so far by our acceptance of the Minister's two amendments would be reciprocated if the Minister accepted this amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the other members of the vocational education committee should be excluded from being members of a college.  Six members of the vocational education committee will be members of the governing body and subsequently members of the college.  Why should the other members of the vocational education committee be excluded from membership in this instance?  Membership of a college is purely an honorary position which does not bring with it any responsibilities or powers; it does not give the members any role in the running of a college.  If the Minister accepts this amendment it will give vocational education committees an assurance that he sees a continuing and effective role for them in the regional technical colleges sector.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. Membership of a college is really an honorary position which does not mean all that much in reality.  I ask Deputy O'Shea to clarify whether he is referring to the principal vocational education committee or all the vocational education committees within the catchment area of the college.  I do not see any problem in appointing the members of the vocational education committee to be members of a college as they will not <Col N="2029" /> impede, hinder or interfere with the workings of the college.  In recognition of their role and participation in some areas of the college it is only correct that they should be appointed members of the college.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 10, which is similar to Deputy O'Shea's amendment proposes, that &ldquo;the members of the vocational education committee&rdquo; should be members of the college.  I put down this amendment because I find it difficult to understand why members of the vocational education committee should be excluded from being members of the college.  The Minister may say that vocational education committees are covered because the members of the governing body are included and vocational education committees will have six members on the governing body.  On a few occasions on Committee Stage the Minister made the point that vocational education committees do not have to have any involvement in the college because they will have six members on the governing body and they can nominate the people to appoint another five members.  This gives the impression that vocational education committees will have 11 members on the governing body.  This is not true; they will only be able to nominate bodies to appoint members who will not be able to speak on behalf of the vocational education committee.  In addition, the members of the vocational education committee on the governing body will speak as members of the governing body; they will not have to report back to the vocational education committees.  They will not be members of the vocational education committee any longer; they will be members of the governing body. The vocational education committee will not have power over the governing body or the college.  The governing body will make their decisions without reference to the vocational education committee. It is wrong to say that the vocational education committee will have some control over the governing body merely because they can nominate members to <Col N="2030" /> it.  I do not think the Minister should give that answer this time.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Shea said, membership of the college does not bring with it any power or control; it is merely a recognition of involvement.  If the Minister believes members of vocational education committees should not have any involvement in colleges he should say so. However if he believes their importance and involvement should be recognised, why can they not be members of a college? We are not dealing with a major issue here; it is merely a question of recognition.  We should at least recognise that the members of vocational education committees have had some involvement in the development, expansion and achievements of the regional technical colleges.</P>

      <P>I support amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy O'Shea.  My amendment No. 10 is almost indentical. I have nothing further to add to the comments of Deputies O'Shea and Mac Giolla.  On amendment No. 11, which deals with FÁS, I support this recognition of the contribution made by FÁS to our educational system.  They have a very valuable role to play in this area and this should be clearly recognised. Therefore I support amendment No. 11.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments in the names of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy O'Shea.  What we are doing here is recognising the corporate image of the college, much of which, as Deputy O'Shea has rightly said, is cosmetic. From the point of view of appearances and of recognising the role of vocational education committees it is right that we should facilitate their inclusion.  The people who have been involved in regional technical colleges from the start have a right to be included on the vocational education committee and the governing body.  There is duplication in that six members of the vocational education committee are also on the governing body.  As a token of recognition of the role of the vocational education <Col N="2031" /> committees it would be a nice gesture on the part of the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the academic council, the members of staff, the registered student body and the graduates of the college.  The amendment in the names of Deputy Ahearn and myself propose that representatives of FÁS be included.  I thank Deputy Garland for supporting this amendment. FÁS are a national training agency who receive a budget of £2 million from the European Social Fund.  They have a common funding mechanism with that of regional technical colleges, which are also ESF funded, although it will be on a diminished scale if the Minister proceeds with the means testing proposal.  A wide range of apprenticeships are provided by FÁS, as is the case with regional technical colleges, yet ne'er the twain shall meet. It is extraordinary that in these two areas dealing with apprenticeships, there is no representative of FÁS on the regional technical colleges, even by way of token recognition.  We would like to see a FÁS presence not merely on the regional technical colleges but also on the governing body.  I do not know whether the term &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; is infra dig.  but we are talking about educational training and apprenticeships have stood the test of time.  If we are to fulfil our ambition to develop apprenticeships within Europe there should be a greater concentration on that area.  There should be positive mention of apprenticeships in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister that the Industrial Training Act, 1967, clearly sets out the role of vocational education committees in apprenticeships.  For example, section 32 (1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Chomhairle may, with the consent of the Minister for Education, make arrangements for the provision by a vocational education committee of courses of instruction in the nature of technical education of a type which An Chomhairle and the vocational education committee agree is suitable for persons employed by way of <Col N="2032" /> apprenticeship in a designated industrial activity.</P>
    <P>Section 32 (2) of the Act states:</P>
    <P>Where a course of instruction is provided by a vocational education committee either under subsection (1) of this section for persons employed by way of apprenticeship in a designated industrial activity, or under section 39 of the Act of 1959 for persons so employed in a trade which stands specified for the time being in an order under section 21 of that Act, An Comhairle may...</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why FÁS, a State agency, should not be enshrined as part of the corporate image or identity of the regional technical college.  We are asking that representatives of the vocational education committee and FÁS be considered for membership of the college.</P>
    <P>We are also talking about the research and development aspect of the colleges. Therefore, we might usefully consider including Eolas, another State agency, to take on board research and development of a type needed in the national interest. If we are making a major play of the fact that regional technical colleges will be heavily involved in research and development, surely Eolas should be included as a component part not alone of the regional technical college but also of the governing body.  I know we are not at liberty at this stage to include Eolas for membership of the college but I am sure it is a matter to which our people in the Seanad will give consideration on Committee Stage of the Bill there.  I am sign-posting to the Minister in advance the need to give some thought to the inclusion of Eolas as well as FÁS.  Perhaps he would respond to that matter.</P>

      <P>The concept of membership of a college is a standard concept which is included in other legislation.  It is designed largely to be internal and not necessarily to include representative organisations who have a genuine interest in the college.  As Deputy O'Shea <Col N="2033" /> said, it is a purely honorary concept, conferring no great duties or privileges.  It is a concept which is standard to third level institutions, listing the membership of the college internally.  However, that in no way diminishes the legitimate external relationships between the college governing body and FÁS, Eolas, the IDA, CTT or Bord Fáilte.  The vocational education committee have a slightly different role in that they are obviously substantially more entwined with the colleges. The relationship between the governing body and the vocational education committee is clearly spelled out in this legislation.  There is a balance between the governing body and the vocational education committee and it is better to keep it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is standard concept which is designed to be internal.  I would point out that section 4 (1) (f) states: &ldquo;such other persons as the governing body may appoint to be members...&rdquo;  The point is made that it is designed to be an internal appointment.  Nevertheless, if the governing <Col N="2034" /> body so decide they could use clause (f) to appoint such other persons as they wish to be members.  If they choose to use that clause along the lines suggested by the Deputy, clearly under the wording of this legislation, although not under the spirit of it, they would be entitled to do so.  Therefore I would not be disposed to accepting these amendments at this stage.  Deputy Higgins referred to apprenticeships and I will deal with that matter later as it arises in a number of areas.</P>

      <P>The inclusion of this provision was raised on Committee Stage of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and I undertook to introduce an amendment to delete the provision on Report Stage.  I am pleased to introduce a corresponding amendment in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> Amendments Nos. 13 and 92 are in line with the principle of removing ministerial control where possible.  They remove the powers of the Minister to direct the provision of specific courses and the requirement for the concurrence of the Minister in designating the title of the chairman. They seek to remove some aspects of the role of the Minister, as I undertook to do on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. On Committee Stage of the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, the Minister agreed to remove the phrase &ldquo;as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo; at my request.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 14 in the name of Deputy Mac Giolla and I, we seek to amend the functions of the college by inserting into section 5 (a) the words &ldquo;taking cognisance of regional interests&rdquo; so that subsection (a) now reads:</P>
      <P>to provide such courses of study as the governing body of the college considers appropriate taking cognisance of regional interests.</P>
      <P>This is a fundamental issue.  The Government side now concedes that the regional technical colleges are now regional institutions in name only because they are part of the CAO-CAS system.  Students from around the country are entitled to apply for places in any regional technical college and if they reach the required standard they must be accepted as students.  This has an effect on the region, particularly where the standard of entry is higher than in another college.  Students from a particular region may have to go to a regional technical college in a different region to pursue the course they are interested in because the entry standard in their own region is higher.  I have seen this happen in my area.  It is very important to take cognisance of the regional interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to take the opportunity to correct a mistake I made a number of times on Committee Stage.  I suggested that the circular letter of 14 May issued by the Department stopped Waterford regional technical college from conferring a series <Col N="2038" /> of degrees or post-graduate awards which had been approved by the National Council for Educational Awards.  It has been brought to my attention since then that that was not correct.  I should like to make that correction now.</P>
    <P>At the outset we were told that the Regional Technical Colleges Bill and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill would give the colleges more autonomy in their day-to-day administration and would allow the colleges become more involved in research and development work.  That is crucial.  The Green Paper on Education states that an important aspect of the new legislation for the regional technical colleges, and the Dublin Institute of Technology, is the provision to permit them engage in research and development work with industry.  It adds that such research would be mainly applied research with a regional dimension and in the area of the synthesis and dissemination of existing knowledge.  It is stated that it is envisaged that basic research would still be conducted largely by the universities.  That is the real agenda.</P>
    <P>On Second and Committee Stages I made the point that the Green Paper stated that the Department envisage the regional technical colleges becoming involved in research and development and consultancy work of a minor nature with the more prestigious and important research and development work going to the universities.  Such an approach would be consistent with the role of regional technical colleges.  However, regional technical colleges have the impression that in relation to the areas of research and development in which they can become involved the sky will be the limit.</P>
    <P>Regional interests in this regard is a broad issue.  In the regions now those projects requiring research and development work that are available from large manufacturing companies gravitate toward the universities.  It is obvious from the statement I read from the Green Paper that the intention is to continue with this trend.  It is somewhat misleading to suggest that one of the two main reasons for the Bill is to allow regional <Col N="2039" /> technical colleges to become involved in research and development work.  The amount of research and development work in which the colleges will be allowed to become involved will be of a subsidiary nature to that of the universities, as stated in the Green Paper.  The Government's intention, in the context of the White Paper on Education and the Bill to amend the Education Act, is that that concept be enshrined into legislation. That constitutes a real curtailment on the scope of the regional technical colleges to develop in a way that would fulfil the regional needs for research and development and consultancy work in industry, commerce or whatever other area of the regional economy would require such work to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Course approval has become rather vague, particularly in the past year. Although the National Council for Educational Awards is the body set up to approve courses it is evident that courses are being submitted to the Department of Education without going through the NCEA.  It seems that colleges expect the Department of Education to approve courses that have not been approved by the NCEA.  A letter from the Department, dated 14 May, stated that the Department propose to eliminate the current June approval mechanism for new courses as soon as possible.  The Minister should state what his Department have in mind.  Does he intend that the approval for all courses will rest with the NCEA or with the Department?</P>
    <P>The phrase I find ominous in the Department's letter is that relating to a general guideline of 10 per cent of students at regional technical colleges pursuing degree courses.  It should be emphasised that the Dublin Institute of Technology, who confer their own certificates and diplomas &mdash; the Minister intends that they should confer their own degrees in the hoped-for timescale of a year &mdash; have a level of 30 per cent of students pursuing degree courses and it is envisaged that throughout the regional technical colleges sector 10 per cent of students would pursue degree courses. <Col N="2040" /> During the Committee Stage debate the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, said 40 per cent of students at Wateford Regional Technical College were pursuing degree courses.  I should like the Minister to give an assurance that his Department do not envisage reducing the number of degree courses at Waterford Regional Technical College.</P>
    <P>In the context of what is proposed in that letter we must also consider the growth of colleges that have a small number of degree courses or no degree courses at the moment.  The Minister said the figure of 10 per cent was a guideline that would give rise to discussion. However, in the letter the 10 per cent is a very definite figure.  It is hardly likely that the Minister, and the Department, expect the figure to be increased dramatically.</P>
    <P>We were told during the Second Stage debate that the Regional Technical Colleges Bill was being introduced to provide for greater day to day autonomy in the administration of the colleges, something with which every Deputy who has spoken agrees.  The concept that many Deputies disagree with concerns the reduced role for vocational education committees. Possibly the greatest argument of all in support of the vocational education committees is the very success of the colleges. Those who have spoken on the debate, including the Ministers agreed that the regional technical colleges are probably the greatest education success story in the history of this State.  Their success has been achieved under the umbrella of the vocational education committees.  A very basic principle when dealing with business, administration or any other matter is that if something is demonstrated to be extremely effective and it is evident that it will continue to be so effective there should be a good reason for changing it.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the colleges need more autonomy in the day-to-day running of their affairs.  Indeed, the IVEA, the body representing the vocational education committees, conceded that point long ago.  The legislation is working towards a broader agenda part of which is that <Col N="2041" /> departmental policy from here on will reflect the interests of the university sector at the expense of regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology. These Bills which, illogically in my view, were introduced before the publication of the Green Paper are being put in place to give the Department of Education much more effective control &mdash; I will not go so far as to say a stranglehold &mdash; of the development of the regional colleges in the various areas they are involved in.  However, to call them regional technical colleges at this time is something of a misnomer.  We have spoken about calling the colleges by some other name, cosmetic it may be in its way, but while the colleges are responding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is all relevant to the general thrust of what the amendment seeks and I was filling in the background to that.  The colleges need to take full cognisance of the regional interests, as the amendment states.  If some of the regional colleges become effectively national institutions responding to a national need as distinct from the regional need with the active encouragement of the Department, that is regressive.  I instance the colleges that are successful and have a higher academic qualification or requirement for entry on to second courses and students from one area may have to go into another region to pursue the very same course.  I ask the Minister to elucidate how the regional interest will be protected in the context of section 5 (1) (a) and to tell us exactly what effect the section I read from the Green Paper will have on the scope of areas of R and D that the colleges can become involved in.</P>

The words &ldquo;taking cognisance of regional interests&rdquo; are to be inserted.  It is simply a comment on where to put them in. Obviously when that phrase is deleted the place to put them in is after &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;. The point is to insert &ldquo;taking cognisance of regional interests&rdquo;.  I cannot see how that could be solved.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I share Deputy Mac Giolla's sentiments.  If you are to insert something after the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;direct&rdquo; has disappeared, you have to change around.  I support the <Col N="2043" /> amendment.  Courses should be run that are appropriate to an area.  In fairness to the regional colleges, I suppose their forte at the moment is they are able to adapt courses to suit what is required. They have been very successful in that they have geared their students towards work afterwards.  In paying tribute to them for this success Deputy O'Shea suggested that the vocational education committee attributed all their success to the fact they had the foresight to deal with practicalities.  Of course they had the backing of European funds, which played a major role.  If they could take cognisance of regional interests that would be a very important guideline for them.  In my region, Carlow, a tillage area, they could become involved with, say, An Foras Talúntais &mdash; and, let me mention, glass could be very important to Waterford as plastics have been in Athlone. They should be encouraged to have some part in happenings in the area.  I support amendment No. 15, which gives them the power &ldquo;to confer, grant or give diplomas, certificates or degrees including post-graduate degrees and honorary awards&rdquo;. If we are to do anything for the regional colleges we must leave them independent. We do not want them subservient to anyone.  They must have university status and they must be able to grant their degrees under their own canopy.  If the polytechnics in England have international standing, our regional colleges should also have international standing and not be looking over their shoulder waiting for somebody to give them the nod, somebody who may not want to do so because that might interfere with their own courses at their own universities.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the ruling that amendment No. 14 <Col N="2044" /> will be out of order if No. 13 is accepted, first because I am in favour of the Minister withdrawing the words &ldquo;and such other courses as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;, particularly the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo;.  By supporting that I am then ruling my amendment and Deputy O'Shea's amendment out of order.  It makes the whole thing ridiculous.  It makes one decide that in future when putting in amendments you will just say &ldquo;put in the words&rdquo; and it is up to you where you put them in.  If the amendment simply were to add at line 25 the words: &ldquo;taking cognisance of regional interests&rdquo; without using the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo;, it would be totally in order.  It is one of these ridiculous, technically out of order amendments.  It is very important to take cognisance of regional interests, as Galway University have demonstrated, particularly in the marine biology area and its importance in research into fisheries, fish farming, the absence of sea trout and so on.  Regional technical colleges should be involved in the regional interest, whether it is farming or whatever else.</P>
      <P>Talking of farming, who is doing anything to help the sheep farmer who is selling his wool for 20p, the same price as he was receiving for it in 1963 or 1964, 30 years ago?  There should be some research and development into that whole area of whether sheep are used for wool or mutton, what a sheep farmer is entitled to, where he could sell his wool or what he should do with his wool. Regional interests are vital in the development of research, courses etc. in the regional technical colleges and I would very much like to see those words inserted.  However, I presume the governing bodies will take cognisance of regional interests and recognise them.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that amendment No. 14 cannot be moved because the Bill is about regional colleges, which serve not only the people of the region but should also serve the needs and interests of the region.  The only way to do that is by providing courses which <Col N="2045" /> will be in tune and in harmony with business interests and the development of the natural assets of the region.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, in Tipperary we identified the need for a rural and business institute because we believed that they would satisfy regional needs and would be in tune with the life, business and industry within the region.  If a regional technical college is to truly meet regional needs it would need its own independence and have the right to confer its own awards; otherwise, it would mean relying on the NCEA or any of the State universities, who might not accept the proposals put forward by a regional college for the necessity to award degrees or diplomas in certain areas.  If the regional colleges had the right &mdash; which I believe they should have &mdash; to award degrees and diplomas they could satisfy the regional need.  The Minister should give serious consideration to this matter.  We must also understand that it is the aspiration of every college to have the power to award degrees, diplomas and certificates in their own right.  They should be able to decide in regard to this matter and have the power to do so.</P>
      <P>It is also considered a privilege for a college to be able to award honorary degrees.  It is a pity that this is confined to universities, because people who may be worthy of such an award may have gained that merit through developments which are more in tune with the regional colleges.  Certainly the regional need will only be truly provided for if the college has the space and the scope to make such awards on their own merits.  As I said, it is regrettable that amendment No. 14 cannot be moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of the amendments.  The wrong reason has been advanced for ruling the amendment out of order, because the section would be improved by its inclusion.  When we talk about &ldquo;taking cognisance of regional <Col N="2046" /> interests&rdquo; we are saying that the appropriate authority to do this is the governing body.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, &ldquo;direct&rdquo; is not part of the amendment; we are trying to insert &ldquo;taking cognisance of regional interests&rdquo; after &ldquo;direct&rdquo;.  If the Minister agreed to delete &ldquo;and such other courses as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;, it will be a far better and democratic way of doing things as it will mean giving it to the governing body. &ldquo;Taking cognisance of regional interests&rdquo; is vital.  When Deputies Kenny, Ahern and I made strong arguments for setting up further regional and technical colleges we did so on the basis of the need to invigorate the regions, which are dying. The populations in these areas are depleted, there is a huge demographic gap, a major unhealthy bulge at the bottom of the scale, where there are many young schoolgoing children, and at the other end of the scale many old age pensioners.  However, the 20 and 30 year olds have left; that is visible in the churches, streets and market places.  It is quite obvious that there is a major threat to the whole social fabric of rural areas.  The only way the regions can be saved is by setting up industrial, service or educational enterprises.  As I said earlier, it is recognised that regional technical colleges and third level institutions have a major impact, not alone in relation to the stabilisation of a population in an area but from the point of view of retention of workers and the creation of higher skill levels within a region.  I referred earlier to the Memorandum on Higher Education in the European Communities, which said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The research capacity of the higher education institutions can also be channelled to support regional enterprises and regional development.  Many regional enterprises do not have the means to carry out their own research, nor are they part of the structure which makes them aware of research findings relating to their own enterprises because they often stand alone.  They do not have liaison, they are small five, ten and 15 employee enterprises. <Col N="2047" /> Often they would not have the capacity to translate such findings into action by applying new methods and new techniques in developing their own products... The research capacity can also be an invaluable backing to regional development agencies in conducting surveys, in determining regional needs, in drawing up inventories of regional resources and in devising and piloting models of devlopment plans.</P>
    <P>If we talk about the Leader programme, integrated resource development and the APCs &mdash; we look upon these as pilot projects designed to help rural areas, which are working well but which need to be translated on a nationwide basis &mdash; we are talking about devising within the regions educational resources and third level courses which relate and interact with the region.  They will be the catalyst for development and growth and will attract people from outside the country as well as developing indigenous resources.</P>
    <P>The May edition of the worthwhile journal, <i>Inside Business</i>, of the Chamber of Commerce talks about partnership profit and goes into considerable detail in relation to the tremendous work being done in University College, Dublin, University College, Cork, the O'Reilly Institute, Trinity College and &mdash; the gem in terms of exploiting industry and industrial partnership &mdash; the University of Limerick and Dublin City University, Glasnevin.  It is quite obvious that universities are scooping the jackpot and that regional technical colleges have not taken off.</P>
    <P>I was a little worried about a remark the Minister made in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology Colleges Bill, his right to tell colleges what courses they may pursue.  It signals that a regional technical college cannot stand shoulder to shoulder in a regional area with a university and cannot get involved in the same courses and, as a logical extension, in research and development. In talking about the phrase &ldquo;the need to have cognisance of regional interests&rdquo;, I see great changes in County Mayo &mdash; 20 <Col N="2048" /> years ago we had eight Deputies, ten years ago there were seven Deputies and we now have six.  Indeed, we have six Deputies because the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, was in the right place at the right time when the constituencies were being redrawn and large slices of County Galway were included; otherwise we would now have only five Deputies. The writing was clearly on the wall and, as John Healy said, &ldquo;Nobody Shouted Stop&rdquo;.  However, a regional technical college would shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to my own county, I could envisage a regional technical college in Castlebar getting involved, for example, in the development of Avonmore who have taken over the controversial UMP plants.  They would be a valuable asset in producing a list of value-added commodities such as paté and so on.  We are not dominating the market in the way we should.  Even though we are producing a top quality primary product we are not producing value-added products.  For example, we are exporting a substantial amount of beef carcases without getting involved in the processing sector.  I could foresee a regional technical college in Castlebar working in liaison with Irish Country Meats or with Avonmore in producing niche products for the European market.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mac Giolla said, other industries such as salmon-farming and mariculture are largely undeveloped but I could foresee a regional technical college in Castlebar, which is only ten miles from the coastline, interacting with enterprises along Clew Bay and at Killary.  In addition, while large tracts of land in County Mayo have been planted during the past 40 to 50 years we have no wood pulp industry.  There has been only limited development.  Despite the fact that there is a huge market for timber, such as conifer, this natural resource is not being developed.  Again, it could be developed in conjunction with the regional technical college bearing in mind the reference in the amendment to &ldquo;taking cognisance of regional interest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to the tourism industry, with particular reference to catering, <Col N="2049" /> despite the fact that their budget has been cut, CERT have secured a 98 per cent placement rate.  Indeed, one is almost guaranteed a job if they graduate from CERT, notwithstanding the appointments made to the board of management which were announced yesterday.  The brothers and sisters of Fianna Fáil Deputies and councillors have been appointed willy nilly.  However, that is a separate issue.  Deputy Ahearn has argued that it is not advisable to move towards nepotism &mdash; a feature of the term of office of the major Government party for so long.  I thought we were to get away from that and move towards open Government and democracy where people would get a job on merit.</P>
    <P>It is vital that this amendment, which includes the reference &ldquo;taking cognisance of regional interests&rdquo;, be accepted if the regional technical colleges are to fulfil one of their major functions, which is to act as a catalyst in relation to regional development.  I ask the Minister to be gracious and to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to a technicality, I regret to say that we cannot deal with amendment No. 14 fully.  We do not have the freedom to take amendment No. 14 first and then amendment No. 13.  We have to take them in order.  In any event, I hope I can persuade the Deputies that we took their views into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the amendment which proposes that the words &ldquo;taking cognisance of regional interests&rdquo; should be inserted, section 5 (1) includes the phrase &ldquo;with particular reference to the regions served by the college&rdquo;.  As this phrase is included in subsection (1) it will apply to subparagraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and so on, whereas if the Deputy's amendment is accepted &mdash; we are both trying to achieve the same thing &mdash; the phrase he proposes would be included in subsection (1) (a) only and would not apply to the other subparagraphs.  I ask the Deputies to accept that by including the phrase in subsection (1) that it will apply to all the subparagraphs whereas if we accept his amendment the phrase he proposes would apply to subsection (1) (a) only.  I <Col N="2050" /> am satisfied, therefore, that the phrase &ldquo;with particular reference to the regions served by the college&rdquo; covers adequately all the functions and remit of the governing body, not just their function in relation to courses.  It will give the colleges a stronger remit, unlike the phraseology included in Deputy O'Shea's and Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment. While I share in their objective I argue that my amendment is better as it would apply to all the functions of the governing bodies and not just one.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea raised the question of the respective roles of the universities and regional technical colleges in relation to research in the context of the Green Paper.  The purpose is not to curtail their role but to clarify the respective roles that will be played by both the universities and the regional technical colleges.  I encourage debate on this matter in the context of the Green Paper.  Given that both have special expertise I wish to introduce an overall policy on research &mdash; and indicate how it should be funded &mdash; which takes account of the strengths of the universities and the regional technical colleges.  My intention is to avoid duplication and unnecessary waste.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea also raised the question of courses and the letter which was circulated by the Department.  As the Deputy is aware, before new courses can be introduced prior validation by the awarding body and the approval of the Department of Education are required. The procedures in relation to new courses will have to be discussed but in general they will be a matter between the college and the validating body.  However, they will have to have regard to national budgetary guidelines.  The Deputy mentioned the figure of 10 per cent but this is merely a guideline.  Again, this matter can be debated in the context of the Green Paper.  As I said, it is only a guideline but a balance will have to be struck.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to have courses approved by the NCEA.  Therefore, agreement will be required with regard to the balance that will have to be struck in relation to the number of certificates, <Col N="2051" /> diplomas and degrees that will be awarded.  The purpose of the letter from the Department was to get a debate going on that matter.  I also put it forward as an example to highlight the withdrawal of the Department from certain areas.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Browne's vision of independent regional technical colleges, or whatever we decide to call them in the future following this debate.  He put the case well and argued that the colleges should be independent, given more autonomy and greater stature and status. I share his vision and think he put the case rather well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins raised the question of research and the need to take cognisance of regional interests.  I have already dealt with that matter.  I strongly argue that section 5, as drafted, deals with the matter in a better way.  I thank Deputies for their support for amendment No. 13 which proposes that the reference to the Minister's role in relation to courses should be deleted.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 27 to 29, to delete &ldquo;with any university in the State or with any other authority approved by the Minister from time to time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment brings us back to the old argument with regard to the right of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology to award their own degrees.  The argument has been made constantly that universities have been given a special status whereas the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology appear to have been downgraded and are considered to be second class third level colleges. This argument has been made regularly and it has been recognised by the Minister who is ceding ministerial <Col N="2052" /> control in a number of areas, for example, in relation to the selection of courses.  In this amendment I am proposing that the regional technical colleges should be allowed to enter into arrangements with the National Council for Educational Awards for the purpose of having degrees, diplomas, certificates and so on conferred.  It seeks to delete the words, &ldquo;with any university in the State or with any other authority approved by the Minister from time to time&rdquo;.  In other words, the regional technical colleges should be given the freedom to make their own arrangements with the National Council for Educational Awards, the body who validate the courses, for the conferring of their own degrees, certificates and diplomas. In addition, the regional technical colleges should be able to make such other arrangements as may be approved by the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <P>I am requesting that the regional technical colleges be given the authority to make their own decisions with regard to conferring of degrees.  There is, as Deputy O'Shea pointed out on numerous occasions, some restriction in the Department of Education in regard to keeping down the number of degrees which may be awarded by regional technical colleges &mdash; a decision appears to have been reached that the number will be restricted to 10 per cent.  It is vitally important in this Bill to eliminate the attitude that regional technical colleges cannot be depended upon, that they must be kept under control and their role restricted to awarding certificates and diplomas.  That role is of vital importance and is recognised to be so.  They will continue to approve and validate courses leading to diploma and certificates, but it is the conferring of their own degrees that the Minister, and his Department, appear to object to.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow the regional technical colleges to enter into arrangements with the National Council for Educational Awards, without interference from anybody else and without having to com- <Col N="2053" /> municate with universities, to award their own degrees.</P>

      <P>I have already spoken on this amendment.  It is only correct that we give full recognition to and praise the NCEA for the marvellous role they have played since their establishment.  During the debate on this Bill we have given full recognition, as was worthy, to the regional colleges for the progress they have made but, in conjunction with that, we should compliment the NCEA.  Without their co-operation, their foresight and co-operation with the regional colleges, we would not find ourselves in the position we are today, where we can speak so highly of the standards of the awards and education achieved in our regional colleges.</P>
      <P>When the regional colleges were established no one envisaged the extent and scope of their diversification.  I do not believe anybody could have foreseen that they would have achieved the high standards and provide the variety of courses they offer today.  Credit for these achievements is due to the NCEA who have always been very open and liberal but who have at the same time, maintained standards and this is very important. They have maintained their vigilance of the standards they have always strived to achieve.  They have not lost that aspiration and because of that graduates are emerging from our regional colleges who not only gain recognition and status at national level but also internationally. They must continue to play their role.  It would be detrimental if any steps were taken in this Bill to undermine or lessen the role of the NCEA.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to pay tribute to them.  It would be another step forward if the regional colleges were given the right to award their own degrees under this Bill.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2054" /> With regard to Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment, section 5 (1) (b) permits the regional technical college to enter into arrangements with the National Council for Educational Awards, with any university in the State or with any other authority approved by the Minister from time to time, for the purpose of having degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards conferred.  We have tried to be as flexible as possible in this regard.  Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment seeks to remove the regional technical colleges flexibility in terms of getting a local university to award a degree to participants in a regional technical college course.  That is probably unwise and it may be better to leave the regional technical colleges with the authority and flexibility to do that.</P>
    <P>If I accepted Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment I would be agreeing that only the NCEA could make awards to the regional technical colleges and I would be ruling out, for example, UCG agreeing with Letterkenny regional technical college that it could award degrees with them under certain circumstances.  The theory of this is good in terms of observing the academic drift in regional technical colleges but I consider it would be unfair to the students who attend the regional technical college in Letterkenny, to inform them that under the Bill we had hoped to make an arrangement with UCG, whereby UCG would award degrees and now we find we cannot honour that.  It would be unfair to the students in that region to cut off that facility from them.</P>
    <P>In the Green Paper we propose that there be more linkages between these colleges and the universities.  Substantial flexibility is needed at third level.  There should be plenty of autonomy for the governing body of an institution and they should be permitted to make sensible arrangements between each other where they see fit from time to time.  I understand the Deputy's thinking but I am not disposed to accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by the Minister but what I <Col N="2055" /> am trying to eliminate is an idea that is circulating around the colleges.  The Dublin Institute of Technology have had arrangements for a number of years with the College of Technology, Bolton Street, and Trinity College for the awarding of degrees.  Those who complete degree courses at the College of Technology, Bolton Street, are graduates of Trinity College.  There is an attitude in the institute and in the regional technical colleges that we do the work and somebody else confers the degrees.  Naturally, they would have that flexibility and I would agree that they should have it. However, there is a perception that the regional technical colleges should be able to confer their own degrees on their own graduates.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The statement made by former Secretary of State, Mr. Brooke, in the House of Commons on 26 March, 1991, sets out the framework and conditions for the current talks on Northern Ireland.  The terms of this statement were agreed before it was made by the two Governments and all the parties participating in the talks.</P>
      <P>When consulted about the proposals of 12 June, the Government agreed to them as set out in the statement issued by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the same day.  On Friday 19 June we participated in a meeting involving representatives of the two Governments and the four parties to discuss a possible agenda for Strand II.  I think all parties would agree that this was a constructive meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish and British Governments held a meeting in London yesterday which gave preliminary consideration to the issues likely to arise in Strand III of the talks.  The Government were represented by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice.  Representatives from each of the four Northern Ireland political parties participating in the talks <Col N="2057" /> also attended.  This was also a useful meeting.</P>
    <P>We believe that by now the way should be clear for the early transition to Strand III.  One of the conditions of the talks process is that confidentiality will be observed by all parties.  It is particularly important at this point in the talks that this condition be strictly observed.  As I did last week, I will keep the Leaders of the main parties in the House informed confidentially of the progress of the talks, from time to time.</P>

      <P>Of course I would have no wish whatever to say or do anything that would hinder the prospect of bringing peace in Northern Ireland through the talks now taking place within three strands.  Does the Taoiseach appreciate or agree with me that progress on all three stands is essential and that, while yesterday's meeting in London was important, relations between all the people on these islands is crucial?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the moving forward of all three strands simultaneously to a common conclusion date &mdash; I think 27 July is the date anticipated for the conclusion of all three strands &mdash; is essential? I would hope the Taoiseach would agree and would ask his representatives and Minister to work towards the completion of negotiations on all three strands by that date?</P>

I am sure he will be aware that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is having a meeting with the leaders of the political parties in the House of Commons today.

      <P>Needless to say, one would not want to jeopardise the negotiating <Col N="2058" /> position of the Government.  I want to express my thanks publicly to the Taoiseach for the briefing I was given last week in relation to some uncertainties which had arisen.  The Taoiseach has said in his reply that the way seems clear for an early transition to Strand II.  Will he say when that will be clarified?  Second, does the Taoiseach foresee this process perhaps arriving at an interim resolution or conclusion by the end of this month, or are we talking about an adjournment until the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Deputy Spring says in relation to his and his party's approach to these talks as well. I might point out to him that the decision to call Strand II will be one for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when he considers that to be appropriate.  It was agreed that the Strand II talks would be called in a matter of weeks after the completion of Strand I.  While the meeting taking place today is on strand I, one must await the outcome of those talks before speculating any further.</P>

      <P>Probably it would be in order for me, on behalf of my party, to congratulate all the parties who took part in the talks in London yesterday on succeeding in ensuring that the talks process will continue.  We would all agree that it is of the utmost importance that the process does continue regardless of how long it might take, although we should all like to see the talks move much faster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two questions to put to the Taoiseach: first, whether at this stage he can indicate when he believes the Strand II meetings might take place; whether, as is suggested, they might take place on a preliminary basis before the end of this month and then get into substantive issues in the autumn?  Second, would the Taoiseach indicate quite clearly, so that there would be no misunderstanding in any quarter, that the Government's position is based solely on the question of how accommodation can be reached between the parties and people of Northern <Col N="2059" /> Ireland to enable them to live in peace with each other and that their position is not in any way dictated by any other party participating in the talks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anybody or any of the parties concerned, certainly in so far as I am aware, doubt the good faith of the Irish Government in approaching those talks.  As we are all aware, the Strand I talks continued for a considerable period of time and there was a considerable amount of progress made within Strand I.  Then it became necessary to sit down and look, in a formative way, at the items that might be discussed in Strand II, which involves the leaders of the different parties in the North and the Government here in Dublin sitting down together.  The meeting to settle that agenda took place and was very constructive.  Then we moved on to having the formative meeting yesterday in London to look at the items on the agenda for Strand III and that too was a constructive dialogue between all parties.  Now the Secretary of State moves on today to have a Strand I meeting with the heads of the various parties in the North of Ireland and it is his decision to call Strand II talks.  I do not see any other obstacles at this stage to calling Strand II talks, but it is Sir Patrick Mayhew's decision.  That was the agreement reached in the very early stages of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the co-operation of the Taoiseach in answering those questions.  I hope he will appreciate the concern of those who are not part of the process that the quality of the meetings appears to be different from where we sit.  Strands I and III have been attended by Ministers whereas the preliminary meeting of Strand II was attended by officials.  Therefore it is important that we convey to the Secretary of State, at least informally, that the decision to announce the date of the serious Strand II meeting would be reassuring to many people.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Central Statistics Office, it is complying to the extent required with all EC statistical legislation with the exception of Directive 78/166 concerning co-ordinated statistics on the business cycle in building and civil engineering which has presented difficulties to a number of member states, including Ireland.  The directive was to have been fully implemented by February 1982.  The EC are long aware of the implementation difficulties and have not pressed the issue.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach give any indication as to when that directive may now be implemented having regard to the fact that it has now been delayed for ten years?  Having regard to the fact that all EC Directives are essentially the collective responsibility of the Government rather than the individual responsibility of any particular member of the Government, would the Taoiseach not agree that he should indicate here those directives with which Ireland is not in compliance and if any of those have been seriously delayed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from Ireland, there are many other countries which have particular difficulties with the directive we are discussing.  The countries concerned are Greece, Spain, Italy, the Nethelands and Portugal.  I agree that if there is particular difficulty with this, it must be looked at again.  This would form the basis of some of the discussions we had at the Council meeting in Lisbon over the weekend.  There may well be directives issued from time to time that are not particularly necessary in the overall European context and perhaps the decisions are better taken at national level so that the whole operation could be made more responsive to the needs of ordinary people.</P>
      <P>Other Departments have been pressed to bring their implementation of EC Directives up to date.  We are not the best, but we are certainly not the worst. Some of the regulations, particulary those in relation to the Department of Agriculture and Food, when finalised would improve our position quite dramatically.  We are proceeding along the basis suggested by the Deputy, but individual Departments have their own responsibility in implementing those directives and taking them through the House.  It is not the responsibility of the Taoiseach's Department.</P>

I refer to the area of consumer credit, <Col N="2062" /> which we were to have legislated for by the beginning of last year, that is, 18 months ago.  I know it has been promised in this House on a number of occasions that the whole area of money lending would be dealt with under this new legislation on consumer credit.  Clearly that legislation is required here.  Could the Taoiseach indicate when he expects that legislation, arising from an EC Directive, will be implemented?</P>

      <P>I was hoping the Taoiseach would not give me that kind of reply.  I deliberately framed the question in the way I did lest he would think I was engaged in any special pleading to upgrade the present Minister for Industry and Commerce who is performing so well at another venue in his own interests, if not in the interests of the Government. Let me put the question in another way to the Taoiseach.  Does he agree with the recommendation in the Culliton report that the focus in the Department of Industry and Commerce should be changed to concentrate on industrial development and that certain specific administrative and regulatory functions currently within the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce should be taken away from it, with the general conclusion that Irish administrative policy is very weak generally in terms of policy formation and that the agencies charged with implementing industrial policy suffer as a result of this clear lack of direction in policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at what the Deputy says in relation to the reply I gave because his question is very specific, that a separate Cabinet position be given <Col N="2064" /> overall responsibility in view of the recommendation in the Culliton report. There is no such recommendation in the Culliton report to recommend the setting up of a special Cabinet position.  That is clear.  The first report of the task force has been submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, when he finishes his consideration of it, will be bringing it before the Government and the Cabinet sub-committee for implementation purposes.  As soon as that arrives the Government will, in due course, make their own decisions after completing their own deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that if the recommendations contained in chapter 9 of the Culliton report were to be implemented it would change completely the present role of the Department of Industry and Commerce and would effectively mean a specific Ministry for industrial development? Having regard to the crisis in unemployment and the bad value we have got for money spent on industrial development over the past 15 years, does he agree that there is a necessity for someone at Government level to take overall responsibility for policy direction in the area of industrial and economic development?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the recommendation to which the Deputy is referring is contained in paragraph 9.3 of the report.  It recommends that a task force be appointed to report to me, as Taoiseach. This is the type of action the Government have taken in this respect. I believe this course of action was recommended because of the activities of a wide range of Government Departments which have a significant impact on industrial policy.  They believe that a task force should be set up under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach of the day to ensure implementation of the recommendations they have put forward.  As I said, I think <Col N="2065" /> the Deputy was referring to paragraph 9.3 of the report.</P>

So far as the Government are concerned, industrial policy has to be about low inflation, competitiveness, investment, taxation and working conditions. The Government have to coordinate all these issues to ensure the pursuance of a very successful industrial policy.  The setting up of a task force under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach of the day to ensure implementation of the recommendations is the proper way to proceed.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 36 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>As the House is already aware, An Post are in serious financial trouble and there is an urgent need to implement proposals to restore the company to financial health.  The settlement of the recent postal dispute enables the company to proceed with implementation of their priority recovery proposals.  An Post are in negotiation with the unions about the company's remaining proposals, excluding those relating to the closure of sub-post offices and the introduction of roadside letter boxes.  As the House knows, these matters were the subject of a report by consultants nominated by the NESC and appointed by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>My examination of the report of the consultants who studied the social-economic implications for rural communities of those two proposals is continuing.  I will arrange for publication of the report and the furnishing of copies to the Oireachtas Library in due course.  I do not propose to comment on media reports on this subject.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread speculation that the Government will not implement the viability plan and, in particular, that the proposals in relation to the closure of sub-post offices, the loss of jobs and the provision of roadside boxes have been dropped?  Would she agree that much of that speculation has arisen as a direct result of the use of the phrase &ldquo;these proposals are not on my agenda&rdquo; by the Taoiseach in a recent interview?  Are these proposals still on the Minister's agenda?</P>

      <P>As I said, I am studying the consultants' report into these two areas which were part of the viability plan.  The consultants were asked to examine these areas on the basis of their economic impact on rural communities. I have not completed my study of that report, but when I do I will publish the report and make it available in the Oireachtas Library.  I cannot comment, nor would I want to, on any speculation in the media or otherwise in relation to what is in the report.</P>

I thought it would have been a matter of considerable importance to find out whether the Taoiseach and his Minister differ in relation to this matter.  I hope the Minister will answer the question.  Assuming there is some going back on these proposals &mdash; I hope I am right in assuming that &mdash; what alternative arrangements has the Minister in <Col N="2070" /> mind for overcoming the financial problems to which she has once again referred?

      <P>If I were to make any comments on my views on a particular subject in advance of studying a report, the Deputy would have another reason for complaint.  Therefore I do not intend to do that.  An Post's recovery proposals were designed to achieve by 1995 the annual savings which they targeted.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 12 and 17 together.  Since my appointment, I have had discussions with all the interests involved on the Shannon stop issue to hear their views at first hand.  I am fully aware of the Shannon Status Committee's position in relation to the Shannon stop arising from the comprehensive submission which the committee have made to me and my meeting with the committee earlier this year.  The committee's views in the matter are being taken into account in my consideration of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>While the pros and cons of a change in policy have been well articulated and publicised by the various interest groups, there is one issue which has not.  Both proponents for and opponents of change have emphasised the need for certainty on this issue for a number of years to come.  I have been asked to ensure that whatever decision is taken will last for some years, irrespective of changes in administration or Ministers, and not to take a decision on this issue until I can be reasonably confident of achieving this objective.  This is a request which I will respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned to ensure that the pivotal role which transatlantic air services play in regional development and employment creation in the west of Ireland is in no way undermined.  At the same time, I am acutely aware of the financial difficulties facing Aer Lingus which the airline themselves have to address and which are not solely attributable to the Shannon stop.  I am also aware of the airline's inability to undertake the investment in fleet replacement <Col N="2075" /> so urgently needed on their trans-Atlantic operations.</P>
    <P>I have not as yet formulated proposals for Government on this issue.  A number of proposals have been put to me in recent weeks which I wish to consider further.  I have no plans to commission a study in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what has happened to her zeal on this matter.  Within days of being appointed the Minister said she would have proposals for Government within a matter of weeks.  She then said she would have them in March and then she said she would have them, at the latest, just after Easter; but now the Minister has no proposals.  I would like to ask the Minister is she incapable of or unable to make a decision.  In view of the fact that the tourist confederation have requested an independent study, that no independent study has been carried out and that the Minister is incapable of making a decision, would she allow independent experts to carry out such a study so that the Government as a whole can make a decision on the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I dealt in my original response with the reason that no decision was made on the matter.  I have been asked to ensure that whatever decision was taken would last a number of years irrespective of a change of Minister or administration.  I said that I would respect that request, and I think Deputy Yates would want me to respect it in the interests of both sides of the argument.  In relation to the independent study, as I said in the initial response, I have no plans to commission a study.  I am not sure what a study would achieve at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for RTE to operate within the terms of current legislation.  I have no statutory function in day to day budgetary and operational matters in RTE.  Based on information received from RTE, I understand that in 1991 the revenue derived by RTE from advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotions in broadcasts exceeded the limit set in section 3, subsectin (2), of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, by roughly £8.5 million.  Section 3, subsction (4) of the 1990 Act sets out the procedure in the <Col N="2077" /> event of revenue derived from the aforementioned sources exceeding the set limit in any year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister, under the Broadcasting Act, has some say in regard to the money that has accumulated. Could she find out, if she does not know already, what is being done with the money and whose control it is under? Would she consider, in view of this limit, that advertising in RTE for small and medium-sized business is so expensive that it is going outside the State and indeed outside the island?

      <P>The last part of the Deputy's question relates to the subject matter of a following question, so I will deal with it then.  Contrary to what the Deputy might think, I do not have any statutory function under the Broadcasting Acts in relation to day to day operational matters of RTE or in relation to their budgetary matters.  I am aware of the difficulties which have been created for small and medium-sized enterprises.  I share the Deputy's concern in relation to the limited availability of advertising and the prohibitive cost of such advertising because of the difficulties which have arisen in the wake of the 1990 Act. That is why I moved quickly to review the 1990 Act. I said here and elsewhere that I hope to have legislative proposals in that regard before the Government in the autumn and I hope that legislation will follow quickly.</P>

      <P>I have recently been concerned at the manner in which some State bodies under my aegis have been commenting through the media on Government policy in relation to the Shannon stop.  As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions on policy are a matter for the Minister concerned or the Government to decide, as appropriate, and the function of the State bodies is to implement such decisions.  Furthermore, there are clearly defined channels through which State bodies can make known their views on Government policy.</P>
      <P>All the State bodies affected by Government policy on the Shannon stop have been given the opportunity to make known to me their views on the matter and to make submissions in that regard. Against that background, I wrote recently to the chairmen of Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte asking that there be no public pronouncements by the organisations concerned on the Shannon stop issue and that anything further they wished to add to their submissions on the subject be communicated to me or my officials through the normal channels.</P>

Is the Minister aware of the implications of gagging members, not just of the boards of these companies but of the workforce, and the implications for a group like Signal which comprises mainly of the staff of Aer Rianta?  Would the Minister agree that it is unacceptable that workers who have declared an interest in their employment should be threatened with discipline for daring to voice an opinion publicly?

      <P>I took my <Col N="2080" /> decision to write to the chairmen of all three semi-State organisations after great care and consideration.  I did so on the basis that it had been represented to me by groups on all sides of the debate that it was most unhelpful, because the matters are so serious and sensitive, that our semi-State bodies should be making public statements on a regular basis on this issue, public statements which were at variance with each other.  Aer Rianta, for instance, made several public statements supporting no change in the Shannon stop, while Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte had made several statements in support of change.  In the interests of a debate taking place in a calm atmosphere it is preferable that the three semi-State bodies should make their views known to me and to my officials.  There is an open door whenever they want to come and discuss issues with me.  It would be more appropriate for the debate to take place in that calm atmosphere rather than by megaphone over the public airwaves.

      <P>I am shocked at what the Minister has said.  It is reminiscent of what would have happened in Eastern Europe.  It is wholly unacceptable.  Given the frustration of Aer Lingus with the Minister and her Department, does the Minister not think that they have a unique voice on this issue since they carried nine out of every ten passengers into Shannon and also in view of the fact that they have lost £100 million in the last three years on air transport?  Given their frustrations, it is only right that they should publicly voice their concern for the future development of aviation policy.</P>

Aer Rianta, as the managers of the airport who have to ensure that they get as much custom as possible through the airport, have an equally unique voice; as do Bord Fáilte, who are responsible for marketing Ireland abroad and getting tourism through Shannon into this country. Because of those three unique voices it is not appropriate that two should publicly support one side of the argument while the other publicly supports another argument.</P>

      <P>The Government have a two pronged strategy for achieving reductions in transport costs: a major upgrading of transport infrastructure, fully integrated with mainland European transport arteries and the development of a flexible and appropriate regulatory framework to maximise competitiveness and efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost £900 million is being invested under the Operational Programme for Peripherality over the five year period 1989-93, jointly funded from EC and national resources.  The investment is in the development of primary roads, particularly the Euro-routes; in airports; sea ports and public transport.  The result in terms of improved efficiency, and shorter journey times, will undoubtedly impact favourably on transport costs to Irish exporters.  The Belfast-Dublin-Cork rail lines have been included in plans at Commission level for future combined European networks.  The Irish authorities are also currently pressing, both bilaterally and at EC level, for improvements in the quality of the rail link between Holyhead and Crewe in the UK <Col N="2086" /> to ensure expeditious inter-linking with the Channel Tunnel.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, still actively pressing Ireland's case for EC aid for investments in sea links to mainland Europe, an area not currently covered by the Community Structural Funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask two questions in relation to integrated transport services. First, what discussions is the Minister having with her colleagues in the Departments of the Marine and the Environment to ensure that we have an integrated transport package to put forward for the next tranche of EC funding in 1994-98?  Second, in relation to funding for a sea bridge is the Minister aware that the Greek Government are now putting forward a special case for funding for mobile assets in that country because of the difficulties in Yugoslavia?  In view of this, do we not have a better chance of getting funding for a sea bridge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that following a report by consultants, jointly engaged by the Government and the EC Commission, an application was lodged by the Government in May 1991 seeking approval for the principle of EC funding for investment in transport services to and from Ireland.  Despite the lobbying of the then Minister and the Minister for the Marine, Ireland's application for funding for mobile assests was rejected in December 1992.  In March 1992, however, following discussions between the Commissioner, his Cabinet and my Department it was subsequently agreed that a revised application be submitted.  That submission has been made and was lodged with the Commission on 24 April 1992, but we are still awaiting a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the co-ordination of the different Departments, very close discussions are taking place between the Ministers for the Marine, the Environment and myself and our officials to ensure that any approach to the Commission for support in the area of transport, whether mobile assets, integrated rail or road transport is co-ordinated and <Col N="2087" /> presented as a joint approach.  I think that is very important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this is the preferred option.  The Deputy should be aware that I will not spare any effort in trying to convince the Commission that this is the better way, particularly because of our peripherality. However, I do not think this should hamper developments within the United Kingdom which would make it easier for our haulage contractors who wish to avail of that route.  We should keep on the pressure for improvements, as indeed the Commission has between Holyhead and Crewe to enable Irish operators to travel more quickly to the Channel Tunnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

That is the preferred option and the Deputy need not worry that this will not be done.  As I have already said, I do not think that should rule out any improvements we can get in the United Kingdom which help our operators, who even if they had better facilities would choose to take that route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that transport costs in general have tended to be higher in the Republic of Ireland than in Northern Ireland.  While I cannot quantify the extent of the difference, it has been reduced in recent years as a result of Government economic policy and the trend towards harmonisation of transport costs throughout the EC.  I have no information on direct cost comparison for access to mainland Europe from either part of Ireland.  The key factors in both access and internal transport costs, such as port and sea freight charges, fuel prices, tax and excise duties, labour and insurance costs, are outside the scope of my remit at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.  The reduction in such costs is not, therefore, a matter for my Department.</P>
      <P>Operations abroad by Irish hauliers are facilitated by my Department by the issue of EC multilateral authorisations, EC cabotage authorisations and licences for access to ECMT member states.  Ireland has also concluded bilateral road transport agreements with most European countries, which facilitate the haulage industry.  The availability of increased numbers of EC multilateral and cabotage authorisations allows greater access to the EC market and the abolition of the requirements for permits for some countries, including the UK has reduced the formalities for Irish hauliers operating abroad.  My Department are continuing to work for the optimum deal for Irish hauliers in terms of access to international markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Factors which militate against fair competition for Irish hauliers, such as inadequate roads and ports, are being addressed by the EC Operational Programme on Peripherality.  Under this programme, the State, with EC assistance, is investing heavily in major improvements in transport infrastructure. As these developments come <Col N="2089" /> on stream they will enable Irish hauliers to arrive at continental destinations more speedily and at lower cost.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> As the important date of 1 January 1993 is approaching, could the Minister say whether things will then get better?  For example, will tax rating come into line? It seems that in England the carrying capacity is used in the assessment of tax whereas in Ireland a gross system, including both carrying capacity and the weight of the transporting vehicle, is used.  It has been put to me that Irish transporters &mdash; and by definition I mean transporters from the 26 counties &mdash; may have their vehicles impounded in the North if something is wrong, whereas the Garda cannot impound the vehicles of Northern transport companies coming into the South, no matter what laws they might break. In that way transporters from the North have an advantage.  If a senior member of the Minister's Government is using Northern Ireland transport companies, would that not prove that they have a cheaper rate of costs?</P>

Is the Minister not concerned that for RORO traffic four out of every ten containers coming into this State or leaving this State go through Northern ports and that this is estimated to constitute a loss of revienue of about £60 million to the Irish economy?

      <P>A deed of trust vesting ownership of the Connacht Airport Company in the Horan International Airport Trust was agreed between my predecessor and the company's shareholders last year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the deed of trust, which is something that has been sought for a long time.  The deed of trust has finally put in place a good management structure and has kept the very valuable property, in which there has been considerable State investment, in the hands of a responsible group of people.  However, I ask the Minister whether she is not somewhat worried that three very valued members of the board have resigned.  One of those members was the chairman, who has been with the company since its inception; one was the chairman of Aer Rianta, whose very presence represented a very valuable unofficial State <i>imprimatur</i> and the other was the managing director of a very big Japanese company in Mayo.  There would seem to be something other than a coincidence in the simultaneous resignation of three members, despite the fact that their public statements would not appear to give reason for anxiety.</P>

The appointment of their successors to the board is a matter for the trustees.  As the Deputy knows, it is not a matter in respect of which I or the Government have any function under the deed.</P>

A detailed assessment of the strategic options for the future of the railway is being carried out at present by CIE in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Finance.  Consultants have been engaged by my Department to assist in this work.  The consultants are expected to report later this summer.

This programme will run until the end of 1993 and is designed to ensure that facilities at the airports are adequate to cope with traffic levels for the foreseeable future.

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that her predecessor, now Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, made available a sum in excess of £1 million for a marketing programme to assist regional airports?  Will she not consider doing the same in view of the fact that many regional airports, Waterford and others, are not satisfied with the level of traffic into their airports?  In view of the fact that the Minister of State comes from that airport region and the Taoiseach is opening the extension next Monday, will the Minister examine the financial position of regional airports <i>per se</i> and ensure that they have sufficient support to continue their existence?</P>

      <P>The allocation of £18.6 million for regional airports is very generous.  It is intended that this package be concluded by the end of 1993.  Of course, I am aware of the difficulties a number of regional airports have in relation to traffic to and from the airports.  In cases where the business community at various regional airports have given their <i>imprimatur</i> to services and have backed up that <i>imprimatur</i> by very strong proposals they themselves have made to the different airlines, we have seen dramatic changes at a number of regional airports.  The Minister of State at my Department has been in consultation with the airport authorities in Waterford and the national airline and others in efforts to improve the level of service and the numbers of traffic both to and from Waterford airport.  We need a strong commitment in each of the <Col N="2095" /> regional airport areas, not just from the management of the airport companies themselves but, very much so, concrete co-operation from the business community in all these areas if we are to help a facility which did not exist a number of years ago, which needs to be built up economically in the region and which can have such great economic advantages and benefits to the region as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed there have been dramatic changes, unfortunately all in the wrong direction as far as Waterford airport is concerned.  Is the Minister aware that the very future of the airport is in jeopardy because of the withdrawal by the two main airlines in the country &mdash; Aer Lingus and Ryanair &mdash; of a number of services?  Is the Minister in a position to regulate traffic to direct these companies to provide a service which meets with the needs of the travelling public and which would help to make the airport viable?  It is in danger of becoming economically unviable as things stand.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy McCormack's region.  This comes back to my answer to the previous supplementary. The future of regional airports cannot be dependent solely on Government or EC support in the form of funding for developing their activities. <Col N="2096" /> That is only part of the future of the airport.  We must ensure that the business community in each regional airport area give concrete backing and support to the airport itself and to those airline operators who are anxious to provide services. If I were to give a directive to an airline the only company to which I could do so under law, would be the national airline, Aer Lingus.  That would cause an outcry, not least from the Deputy's party.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to give that direction.  I understand, too, that Aer Lingus are meeting the Waterford airport authorities this week as I am sure Deputy Deasy is aware. I do not know what will happen as a result of that meeting, but I know the Minister of State at my Department, who happens to be a Waterford man himself, has lost no opportunity since he came into the Department to impress upon both airlines the importance, form an economic point of view and from the point of view of the development of the airport, of the possibility of increased levels of activity by those airlines in and out of Waterford airport.</P>

The business community in Waterford and the general public there, the ordinary person in the street, have contributed huge amounts of money to support this airport and make it what it is.  With reference to what the Minister has been saying, they have done everything possible to make it a viable institute but they need some political support, political clout.  They need some assistance from the State airline, and from Ryanair if possible, otherwise the whole operation is in jeopardy.

      <P>The section of the Bill which deals with the functions of the college was fairly generously amended on Committee Stage by the Minister for Education.  He also introduced another amendment this morning which we had sought on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The three amendments in my name to this section relate to section 5 (1) (c) which gives the Minister the powers to determine the conditions under which regional colleges may engage in research, consultancy and development work and to provide such services in relation to these matters as the governing body of the college consider appropriate.  There are divergent views on this side of the House in relation to the retention of the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine.&rdquo;  In this case it is appropriate that the wording remains because we are dealing with the colleges becoming involved in research and development work; the later subsection &mdash; (1) (e) &mdash; deals with the colleges becoming involved in limited liability companies so that they can pursue research and development work on behalf of the colleges.</P>

    <P>Because of what is involved here, particularly as quite an amount of money can be involved, if things go wrong with research and development there must be a safeguard for the colleges in relation <Col N="2153" /> to any difficulties which may arise for companies with whom the colleges are involved.  By and large I agree with the retention in section 5 (1) (c) and (e) of the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine.&rdquo;  It is also important to insert a democratic principle in the Bill and that is why I am seeking that section 1 (c) should read &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may, by order, determine&rdquo;.  I also want to introduce an amendment to section 5 (1) (e) to include the phrase &ldquo;by order&rdquo;.  The other amendment I am seeking is that wherever an order is proposed to be made under this section, a draft of the proposed order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  It is important in this area that the Houses of the Oireachtas have a function in relation to the conditions laid down for the carrying out of research and development work by the colleges and indeed the colleges becoming involved in what can be loosely called campus companies to pursue such work.</P>
    <P>The principle of giving greater autonomy to the colleges is one which we all support but in this area, because of the nature of the work involved and how it will be carried out, the conditions laid down should be subject to the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The colleges are located in different regions throughout the country and the collective wisdom of the staff as conveyed to local public representatives, councillors, Deputies or Senators should be taken on board.  It is important, when the regulations are presented, that the benefit of such consultations should also be taken on board before the conditions are enshrined in law.  If the Minister is agreeable to these amendments the orders made by him under this section should be subject to ratification by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the rationale behind the amendments and I ask the Minister to consider my argument sympathetically because it will safeguard the colleges and students.</P>

      <P>This is another question of the Minister seeming to take more power than is necessary and that is why it is very important to delete &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister says in justification of this.  He has made an effort on Report Stage to amend the Bill as dealt with on Committee Stage, much of which involved decentralising power which he had taken to himself.  I am very glad about this and I appeal to the Minister to give a little more and to trust the regional technical colleges and the vocational education committees to do things as they see fit.  He should not try to impose ministerial edicts in this area.</P>

      <P>I agree with the retention of this section.  Prior to the adjournment we were extolling the virtues of research and development and looking forward to a new era involving the regional technical colleges.  In particular, we laid a heavy emphasis on the catalyst of the regional technical colleges for regional growth and how they should emphasise, correlate and interact with outside and native enterprises to develop indigenous industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to research and development, I accept the arguments put forward by Deputy O'Shea &mdash; with which I am sure the Minister agrees &mdash; that in its regulation there needs to be a supervisory role.  While we advocate the use of research and development facilities in the college to assist small industries who do not have their own research or development or access to the kind of material and research which regional technical colleges have in relation to assessing the markets, etc., it is important that any research and development &mdash; we said this in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill &mdash; should be educationally related and involve something which will benefit the students.  There seems to be a need for a regulatory procedure and I am sure the Minister will not have any problem in relation to being satisfied about the bona fides of <Col N="2155" /> those involved and giving the necessary assent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome most of the provisions of this section of the Bill because they are student orientated.  I am glad that regional technical colleges will be updated and made more relevant to universities and industry because the day has gone when technical education was seen to be in a vacuum.  It must now be seen as a transition to industry, based on changes in industry and relevant and sensitive to those changes.  The link with universities is also important because, unless standards are updated and values improved, education in this sphere will lag behind changes in Europe and indeed throughout the world.  I welcome what the Minister is trying to achieve in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is also important to encourage initiative, the Irish expression is: Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh siad.&rdquo;  We must also recognise talent and the Minister must, like his predecessors, go to the colleges to award prizes and to encourage the students at that level.  He should not be seen as issuing diktats and asking people to carry them out.  It is important for the Minister to lead the way in this respect.</P>
      <P>While I accept what the Minister has said, that he wants to encourage the best students to avail of these provisions, if European Social Fund grants are curtailed as and from next September he will defeat the purpose of what he is trying to achieve, which is the best possible mix of students in third level educational courses. If the Minister curtails or cancels maintenance grants from next September he will cause distress for both parents and students who are planning to enrol in September.  This would negative and defeat the purpose of the Bill.  What the Minister should do is encourage the best students to come forward to avail of these provisions.  I can see no logic in his argument. On the one hand, he is laying down high standards in the section but, on the other, he is going to deny students access to these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> I should say that the Minister is not responsible, rather his predecessor is, but I ask him to review the section, otherwise it will be flawed.  It does not make sense to lay down standards, which is laudable, and to then prevent people availing of these provisions.  Again, I appeal to the Minister to restore the grants, otherwise he will do much damage and cause distress to students.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 18 seeks to remove the provision that the Minister may determine conditions in relation to research, consultancy and development work, while amendment No. 20 seeks to make a similar change in relation to the section that deals with limited liability companies, that is, companies that exploit research.  Amendments Nos. 19, 21 and 23 provide that the Minister may only determine these conditions by order.  I do not think I need to overstate the case as both Deputy Higgins and Deputy O'Shea have made it for me.  They have argued that the Minister should have a reserve power in this area to avoid duplication and for financial reasons.  I thank them for their support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy O'Shea, I do not think it is necessary to proceed by way of an order.  While I know what the Deputy is trying to achieve, to ensure it is made public, I give an undertaking that the conditions will be published.  Such a procedure would be less cumbersome. Indeed, if we were to proceed by way of <Col N="2157" /> an order we could slow down the procedure having regard to the fact that limited companies operating in the national or international field and dealing with fast moving business might not want to wait for a ministerial order if the matter can be dealt with more quickly.</P>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, it is not our intention to ensure that each project should seek clearance; I am more interested in laying down general guidelines and conditions outlining those areas where they will have to seek the permission of the Minister.  However we wish to avoid this, where possible.  While I share the Deputy's objective it would be much simpler if I gave an undertaking to ensure that the general conditions will be published.  In effect, therefore, we will derive the same benefit.</P>
    <P>We have deleted the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; from a raft of sections of the Bill but this is one of the areas where I want to retain it.  As I explained the last day, I had considerable experience in my previous portfolio of dealing with a whole range of subsidiary companies.  I learned that one has to be extremely careful about the reporting mechanisms between subsidiary companies and the main company. I pointed out that if anything were to go wrong in a subsidiary or campus company, Deputies would want to know what controls were in place.</P>
    <P>The points raised by Deputy Kemmy about the ESF grants are not strictly relevant but I should say it is not our intention to cut students out by proceeding with the changes; rather we are trying to attract more students by introducing equity into the system as between the regional technical colleges and the universities. I agree with the Deputy's comments that the regional technical colleges must be relevant in the real world and that is what we are trying to ensure here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In his response the Minister attributed to me something that I did not say.  As I have stated already, I agree that conditions should be applied in relation to section 5 (1) (c) and (e).  I also made the point this morning that the colleges should be able to respond and <Col N="2158" /> carry out all the research and development work that is available within the region.  Therefore I do not share the Minister's view on that point.</P>
      <P>The conditions and regulations that I would envisage would be macro in nature.  I would not envisage the Minister introducing regulations in respect of each project at each regional technical college. As I said, the regulations that should be applied in this case should be macro in nature.  Therefore, I do not believe the argument the Minister has made, that we might be slow to respond to international companies, is relevant.</P>
      <P>I wish to make the criticism that since I became my party's spokesperson on education at the commencement of this Dáil we have not had a great number of opportunities to discuss educational matters in the House.  It is my belief that these matters should be discussed as often as possible given that the position is ever-changing and that we react to new situations.  In this context the procedure whereby an order would have to be made would not inhibit the proper development of the conditions that we are talking about in relation to research and development and campus companies.</P>
      <P>As I said, the regulations should be macro in nature.  In light of our experience it may be necessary to amend them but before the package is agreed the documents should be published and approved by the House.  While we all support the concept of devolving authority, to which the Minister is committed, the Oireachtas as distinct from the Minister and his Department should have an ongoing creative role in education.  As I mentioned earlier, there is a need to debate educational matters in the House &mdash; this could very well be an exciting new departure &mdash; and all Members should have an opportunity to make a meaningful input before such conditions pass into law.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for your tolerance.  I will be very brief.</P>
      <P>A phenomenon of Irish education has been what has been described as the rat race, the growing pressure on young people.  The points race is very much a reflection of the rat race but when one enters third level education, there is an equal amount of pressure.  Having won the points race one then enters a further intensive element of competition.  This is based on higher standards and the fact that if one fails one's first or second year examinations the scholarship is lost for that particular year.  Standards are improving and the pressure is intensifying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pressure on pupils is becoming intense and we are now very much aware of the tragic but common phenomenon of suicide, particularly among young people.  I ask the Minister, irrespective of the charge involved, try to enshrine in all education legislation the need for greater counselling and support services. Very often in colleges they tend to forget the need for this type of service.  In all colleges we should establish ease of access to counselling and support services. There should be a system of early identification of students who are under such intense pressure that they may be <Col N="2160" /> tempted to do what has often been done in the past.  We should instil into the student population who may be under such pressure the feeling that there is a shoulder that they can lean on.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 24 is in the names of Deputies J. Higgins and T. Ahearn.  Amendment No. 25 is an alternative.  Amendments Nos. 26, 27, 28, 29, 35, 37a, 93, 95, 96, 97, 98 and 99 are related.  I propose therefore, that amendments Nos. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 35, 37a, 93, 95, 96, 97, 98 and 99 be taken together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 28 to 30, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a) the governing body of a college shall consist of 18 members (including the Director) one of whom (other than the Director) shall be elected to be chairman.</P>
      <P>(b) The members of the governing body other than the chairman and the Director are referred to in this Act as ordinary members.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to determine that the chairman of the governing body will be selected from the membership of the governing body.  We debated this issue at some length on Committee Stage and during the debate on the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill.  The same points were made.  We have dwelt at length on the <Col N="2161" /> competence of the governing body to run and handle their own affairs.  When one looks at the composition of the governing body one will see that it consists of six members of the vocational education committee which represents a good democratic input.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in a subsequent amendment I suggest that the representation be increased to seven because of the considerable anxiety expressed by the chairman of the IVEA.  I have a subsequent amendment which states that of the seven, five should be elected representatives because it is important to recognise the role of elected representatives as distinct from the valuable but, nevertheless, subsidiary role of people who are nominated to such committees. People who go through the rigours of local elections and put their reputations on the line are entitled to a more dominant position.  I do not believe the representation should be three and three.</P>
    <P>In relation to the competence of the group to elect their own chairperson the very analysis of the composition will underpin the points we make.  For example, there will be six vocational education committee members and, in addition two people nominated by the academic staff.  They will be two people from the top echelon with third level qualifications representing the academic staff and there will be one person nominated by the non-academic staff.  I appreciate the Minister taking on board the amendment giving students two places rather than one.  There will also be one person nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; I welcome the ministerial amendment to allow for that representation; I do not understand the reason it was deleted in the first place. Last, but not least, there will be five people nominated by organisations recommended by the vocational education committees, people from commerce, agriculture, the professions and different walks of life.  The Minister has enshrined in this section the requirement that these people must have a certain <Col N="2162" /> amount of expertise and also be members of recognised bodies which is desirable.</P>
    <P>My amendment is a section from the original Bill presented by a former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  It proposes that the chairman should be nominated from the existing membership of the governing body.  The Minister makes the point that it is his right to nominate the chairman from outside this group.  He said that where he has done this in other colleges, he has always exercised discretion and chosen somebody of a particular competence.  I wish to make the point that this body is as cross-sectional as one can get.  There are people from the top levels of academia, people who have over the years pioneered vocational education and who, in the absence of legislation, built the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology to their present level, who feel they have a justifiable right to bid for the chairmanship of the governing body.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other amendments which seek to increase the membership from six to seven I would suggest that FÁS be included on the governing body. We were unsuccessful in including FÁS in what was seen as the concept of the college &mdash; the section states, &ldquo;the college shall consist of &mdash;&rdquo; though as an entity it will never meet and it has no functions or power.  We appealed to the Minister to, from a cosmetic point of view, include the vocational education committee and FÁS.  The argument advanced by the Minister for not including FÁS was that when referring to the collective image of the college one meant people from the inside.</P>
    <P>We are talking about putting a FÁS representative on the governing body. FÁS are a State agency with a budget of £200 million, funded from the European Social Fund &mdash; from which the colleges are funded; which undertakes valuable work in relation to part of their mandate, that is, education, training and apprenticeships. Quite obviously there is an interaction between the two agencies. FÁS is the State agency responsible for training and the Industrial Training Act <Col N="2163" /> states that the vocational education committees have a vital role to play in relation to apprenticeships.  The obvious thing therefore is to nominate a FÁS representative on the governing body.  As I said previously, it is my belief that EOLAS should be represented on the governing body as well.  We have spoken much about the merit of research and development.</P>
    <P>In relation to the aspiration of having the chairman of the governing body elected, the Minister acknowledged that the IVEA met him yesterday and that he was extremely impressed by the arguments they advanced for the insertion of powers that have been culled or deleted on Committee Stage.  We are grateful to the Minister for having tabled amendments Nos. 6 and 7 re-establishing the role of the vocational education committees. What we want the Minister to do here &mdash; I am sure it was a point made to him by the IVEA yesterday, but I am open to correction on that &mdash; is allow IVEA to at least have the option at some stage of having their members considered for the post of chairman of the governing body.  If the Minister would travel this final part of the road it would do much to allay the anxiety &mdash; in some cases the anger &mdash; felt by elected vocational education committee members on what they perceive to be a lack of recognition or downgrading of their role.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of ICTU and I would ask that FÁS be included also. I have not heard any cogent argument advanced as to why they cannot be included.  It would make a lot of sense to have them, or at least a representative of theirs, serve on the governing body.  Last but not least, we advocate that the chairman would come from among the membership of the governing body, whether the number be 17, 18 or whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for that clarification.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 24 has to do with the election of the chairperson, from where that person should emanate or whether he or she should be appointed.  I have made my position clear on this; I am not in a position to accept the amendment. We should remember that there will be 19 persons serving on the governing body.  The Minister will have one nomination, granted an important one, but nevertheless one out of a total of 19.  One nomination out of 19, as it were, for the Government of the day can hardly be said to be an attempt to dominate the governing body.  In fact, I would think it irresponsible of any Government not to seek to appoint at least one person directly.  I grant there is a technical provision that the Minister shall appoint the entire board, but I do not consider one direct appointment to be excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> The chairperson is important.  Arguably, of equal importance is the director, since on a day-to-day basis the authority of managing and developing the institution will lie with the director rather than with the chairperson, who will have a more guiding or strategic-type role.  Of course, that director will be appointed by the governing body.  Therefore, it will be seen there is no attempt on my part, or that of any future Minister, to become involved in the day-to-day administration of the institution by appointing the chairperson. The chairperson will deal with strategic issues and chair the organisation, where as the director will be appointed and deal with the management and development of the institution on a day-to-day basis.</P>
    <P>The second point I wanted to make is that, all along, I have rejected the notion that these are just local, regional institutions. They are more than that.  They are, as it were, national institutions located in the regions.  Students can come from all over the country &mdash; I know they tend to come predominantly from the particular region in which a college is located &mdash; so they are not just local institutions. Neither do I think they would like to be perceived as such.  They would like to be seen as having national importance, to grow in stature and be perceived as truly national organisations.  The fact that they happen to be located in, say, Letterkenny, Carlow, Dundalk or anywhere else is not the issue.  I reject the notion that these are just local institutions. Their funding comes from national resources and from the European Community.  Since their director will be appointed on a national basis that does not mean that their chairperson could not be a local person.</P>
    <P>Another point I wanted to make in regard to the appointment of the chairperson &mdash; is that he or she can come from within the governing body.  We are not saying that the Minister will appoint somebody from outside the governing body and tag them on.  If it was decided to appoint somebody already a member of the governing body, then clearly that <Col N="2166" /> person would come from within their membership.</P>
    <P>Another point I wanted to make &mdash; and I should say this in deference to all Ministers, past, present and future &mdash; is that there is an attempt regularly to suggest that Ministers have no democratic mandate, that they are not elected, that the only people elected are councillors who really are elected democratically. Yes, they are; I accept that. But we here in this House are elected too.  This and future Governments will be elected.  It would be wrong of me to let the record go lest it be seen that I was agreeing to this notion that if a Minister decides to do something it is undemocratic, whereas if local authority members decide to do something it is entirely democratic.  I could not accept that analysis at all.  Members of this House and Governments are elected. Ministers are appointed under the Constitution and have a democratic mandate. Therefore, it is not correct to suggest that the process is more democratic whenever a vocational education committee or a local authority committee take decisions. That process is democratic, but so too are decisions of the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins raised the question of FÁS and EOLAS being represented on the governing body.  I have some sympathy with what the Deputy is trying to achieve but I do not think it can be done by appointing a FÁS or EOLAS representative to serve on the governing body.  For example, the vocational education committee have five nominations open to them.  If they feel this is important there is no reason they could not nominate a representative of FÁS or of EOLAS under section 6 (4) if they felt those two organisations should be represented. To an extent I think Deputy Jim Higgins can leave it to them.  They have five nominations; it might take all of their time to select which five but they can select representatives of five organisations. If they feel that a representative of FÁS or of EOLAS is the appropriate one, then that is what will happen.  Of course, they will have to consider other <Col N="2167" /> organisations such as CERT, which is considered to be important by many regional technical colleges because of the importance of the tourist industry in some locations.  The IDA are another important organisation, as are Córas Trá- chtála and Bord Fáilte.  There is a whole range of very important organisations, dependent on where the relevant institution may be located.  It is better, if the vocational education committee consider any organisation to be important, that they would be able to select that organisation as one of their five nominees.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 is restoring the ICTU, and Deputies understand the reason for that.  The only reason they were excluded originally was to try to tighten up the size of the board which was becoming cumbersome.  However, I accept their legitimate role.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 is to ensure that the vocational education committee recommendation is not needed for the chairman because that is to be a ministerial appointment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 27 is a Government amendment and seeks to restore the vocational education committee's recommendation for membership &mdash; in other words, a recommendation must come from the vocational education committee for the appointments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 is consequential on putting back the ICTU representative. Amendment No. 29 is also, in a different context, restoring the need to have a vocational education committee recommendation before the appointments are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to compliment the Minister on restoring the automatic place for the ICTU on the board.  It is a pity they were removed in the first place.  It gave rise to a debate that was unnecessary on Committee Stage.  Indeed, I called for a vote on that issue.  However, I suppose all is well that ends well and I compliment the Minister on the action he has taken here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down an amendment on Committee Stage looking for an automatic <Col N="2168" /> place on the board for a representative of the employer organisations as well as one for the ICTU representative.  I still hold that that would be an important provision.  It is not now certain, in the context of the five remaining places to which the vocational education committee can nominate people, that they can nominate people from the categories from which these people come.  In the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, providing for an automatic place for the employers side would have been a progressive step.  I would also like to see provision for a regional representative from the agricultural community, and this is something that obtains on the regional college board of management in my own area. However, we are not dealing specifically with those issues now.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about democracy in the context of the Minister of the day.  The Minister is elected to Dáil Éireann and is appointed to the Government in a democratic way.  The Minister says that he can appoint one out of 19 members to the governing body.  Would it not suffice that the Minister's nominee be an ordinary member of the board? That person would consequently have a vote in the election of the chairperson?</P>
    <P>The Minister says that in the context of the day to day running of the colleges the director of the college has a strategic role.  That is so.  What is coming across from the Minister is the idea that the chairperson will be communicating with the Minister in ways other than under the normal procedures as laid down in the Bill.  If that is the intention, it is not a good intention.  The chairperson conducts the business of a meeting. Communications with either the vocational education committee or the Department of Education would normally come from whoever performs the secretarial duties in relation to the board. It perplexes me somewhat that the Minister's nominee must be the chairman.  In as much as the chairman is something of a referee at meetings he would obviously have some function in the putting <Col N="2169" /> together of the agenda for meetings and where so authorised by the governing body, could be instructed to seek a meeting with the Minister of the day or senior officials of the Department on specific issues.</P>
    <P>The mandate of the chairman comes from the governing body.  Why it is necessary that the Minister's nominee should be the chairman is something I am not quite clear about.  There is an inherent danger in this approach in that it will put the appointment of the chairman into the political arena.  I am not directing this argument at the Minister personally but at the legislation in the context of the workings of the political system in this country.  If a chairman were to be appointed by the Minister of the day, whatever party he or she may represent, that appointment would come within the ambit of political patronage and the appointee would be very unlikely to be of a political persuasion different from that of the Minister.  I am not suggesting that this is the Minister's intention. However, the reality is that this is how it would work out in time.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to strongly consider accepting the amendments in the names of Deputies Higgins and Ahearn seeking that the chairman be elected.  There is some merit in the argument advanced by the Minister that in certain circumstances the appointment of some eminent industrialist or academic would be justified that that input could be made just as effectively by a person nominated to an ordinary place on the board as distinct from the chairperson.  I do not see the logic of the Minister's argument that because the Minister can nominate only one out of 19 members that nominee should be the chairman.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that these institutions are not just local regional institutions.  This brings us back to the kernel of the case.  The colleges are called regional technical colleges.  If a number of colleges are allowed to grow too far towards being national institutions a certain element of specialisation will follow.</P>
    <P>I referred this morning to students who may have to attend colleges in other <Col N="2170" /> regions because the entry qualifications to the colleges in their regions are too high.  This does not make sense.  Deputy Kemmy referred to ESF grants.  From the point of view of the best utilisation of resources, students should be facilitated in every way in pursuing courses at the colleges in their regions.</P>
    <P>It is illogical to regard regional technical colleges as national institutions as distinct from regional institutions.  The Minister sought to some extent to justify his proposal that the chairperson should be appointed by the Minister of the day on the basis that the appointment would reflect the national character of the institutions. The regional technical colleges have been very successful.  I have had first hand experience of the importance of that success to a region.  The success of these colleges depends to a very considerable extent on the input by various groups and interests in the region.</P>
    <P>I strongly hold that the chairperson should not be appointed by the Minister. I accept that the Minister is not overdoing it in seeking to appoint one person out of 19.  The person nominated by the Minister should have attributes, experience, expertise or knowledge which will contribute to the development of a college. The argument in relation to democracy is all very well but I do not believe the appointment of the chairperson should rest solely with the Minister.  I respectfully suggest that the person appointed as chairperson will have to wear the appropriate political jersey.  Unfortunately, I believe this is the basis on which the chairperson will be appointed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously re-examine his proposals, which I do not believe will be in the best interests of the development of the colleges, something to which, like all Members of the House, he is fully committed.  This proposed change in emphasis was introduced into the debate relatively recently.  None of the arguments put forward by the Minister in support of his proposal that the chairperson should be appointed by the Minister of the day has convinced me that he will not be appointed on the basis of political patronage.  I suggest that this <Col N="2171" /> proposal is not in the interests of either education or democracy.  I accept the Minister's commitment to improving our educational system but I believe he has got it wrong on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal put forward in this amendment is not exclusive to Deputy Higgins and me.  I wish to remind the Minister that our proposal is in total agreement with the provision contained in the Bill when his two predecessors, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, and Deputy Davern, were in office.  Therefore, it cannot be argued under any circumstances that the appointment of the chairman by the Minister is a deeply held conviction in the Department of Education.  Obviously there is no educational merit or grounds for the retention of this power by the Minister.  If there was any merit in the Minister's proposal, why did his two predecessors not abide by the same decision? If the Department of Education believe that the chairman should be appointed by the Minister, why was it not brought to the attention of the Minister's predecessors? The proposal that the chairperson should be appointed exclusively by the Minister belongs entirely to Minister Brennan.  He is the first Minister associated with this Bill who has argued that the Minister should appoint the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat worried about this proposal. I am afraid that we will go down the same road the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, travelled yesterday in regard to the appointments to the new council of CERT: the eight people he appointed are members of his party &mdash; two of them are Fianna Fáil county councillors, three of them are relatives of Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Members or MEPs and two are well known Fianna Fáil activists.  In spite of the Taoiseach's claim that people would no longer be appointed on the basis of their political patronage and there would be no more jobs for the boys, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, has resorted to <Col N="2172" /> the old tricks of the trade: everyone of those appointees was totally and absolutely aligned with Fianna Fáil.  It is difficult to believe that the chief executive office of CERT was dumped from the board.  I do not understand why this was done.  It is also difficult to accept that the eight Fianna Fáil appointees were that much better equipped for appointment to the national council of CERT than the chief executive officer of that body.  I am concerned that this may be a new trend by the Government, and that by retaining the power to appoint the chairman nine more jobs will be given to political friends of the Minister.  This will undermine the integrity and independence of the governing body in the same way as the appointments to CERT made yesterday by Minister Cowen will undermine the integrity and independence of CERT.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Shea, I ask the Minister why, if he needs a watchdog on the governing body, it has to be the chairman. Could it not be any one of the ordinary members?  The Minister pointed out that the chairman could be selected from the ordinary members.  Would this not require an amendment to the Bill? Section 6 (2) (a) provides that the governing body of a college shall consist of a chairman and 16 ordinary members. If the chairman is appointed from the ordinary membership the number of members will be reduced.  Because the appointment of the chairman from the ordinary members would require an amendment to the Bill I believe the Minister is intent on appointing his own chairman.</P>
    <P>Will there be a chairman from Galway on the governing body of Waterford Regional Technical College?  That provision does not stand up.  It is a pity because I have admired the Minister's acceptance of many of our amendments. He has been very reasonable, but this provision undermines the educational aspiration that exists throughout the Bill. As a result of my experience with the new council of CERT yesterday I am dubious and totally unhappy about giving any Minister of this Government the enormous power of appointing the chair- <Col N="2173" /> man of the governing bodies of our regional technical colleges.  It is a good Bill that is long overdue, but we must not undermine the integrity or indeed the independence of the governing body.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Listening to my colleague, Deputy Ahearn, outline what happened yesterday I realised that open government is defined as open to appointment of Fianna Fáil supporters.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will not accept that, nor will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but it fits in nicely with what the Deputy has outlined and which has not been refuted.  Therefore I take it that the Deputy is telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I accept that; and when you had the opportunity of making appointments, Sir, you were impartial.  I would remind the Minister that while nurses were holding his hand I spoke on Second Stage against the right of the Minister to make this appointment because there is always the danger that there will be jobs for the boys.  I am not questioning the Minister's integrity, but there are powers that could twist his arm and force him to appoint people.  Considering the large management board that will exist, it is incredible that one of the members cannot be nominated as chairman.  I find it very difficult to understand that their ability can be questioned, that the Minister would have to bring in somebody who may have expertise.  If the Minister appoints a person from outside the region because he or she has certain expertise, he is suggesting that none of the members has the necessary expertise to be chairman. There is something wrong in that thinking.  It suggests that these people are not up to standard.  Maybe the Minister has some notion or fear he is not expressing, but he is certainly not paying a compliment to those who will be asked to serve on the governing body.  Now that <Col N="2174" /> the Minister is in the full of his health, he should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the comments made by other Deputies in regard to amendment No. 24.  We dealt with this matter on Committee Stage.  I believe it is wrong that the Minister should have power to appoint the chairperson, particularly considering that in the Green Paper he is devolving powers to local schools.  In this case we are talking about very important regional colleges and rather than devolving the power of appointment of the chairperson, who will be the most powerful person on the governing body, the Minister is removing this power from the governing body.  This is not in line with the Minister's proposals in the Green Paper and many arguments have been made against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main argument made relates to political appointees, but a political appointee may not necessarily be a bad person.  The most important feature of this proposal is that we are taking from the governing body the power to appoint their own chairperson.  I have no doubt that most Ministers would appoint an excellent person as chairperson, but that person would take direction from the Minister rather than from the governing body.  The person appointed by the Minister would be known to him to be an excellent person, but he would have to check with the Minister before deciding on an issue concerning the governing body.  In order to retain some academic freedom in the colleges it is vital that their chairperson is not a ministerial appointee, a person of whom they would be suspicious from the start regardless of how good he might be.  People would wonder why the Minister appointed him and therefore it would be better for the <Col N="2175" /> colleges if the Minister did not retain that power.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on putting down a series of amendments in this grouping.  In amendment No. 35 he proposes that one person shall be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and that is to be very much welcomed. Amendments Nos. 95 and 96 propose that an appointment be accepted on the recommendation of the vocational education committees, which is also welcomed. Amendment No. 98, which proposes to delete &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;vocational education committee&rdquo;, is very commendable &mdash; no doubt the Minister was aware of the attitude of vocational education committees to the amendments on Committee Stage of this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on this proposal which will be of great benefit in local areas and regions.  It will restore the good relations between vocational education committees and the Minister and the Department which were in danger of breaking down.  I welcome <Col N="2176" /> these amendments and add my voice to those who say that the appointment of the chairperson should be in the hands of the governing body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister we are in no way assured in relation to his intention of assuming to himself power to appoint the chairman. The point has been well made by successive speakers from all Opposition parties that there is a wide spectrum of educational opinion and expertise in the composition of the governing body. There is no reason to doubt that these people will have the expertise to preside over meetings.  That is what we are talking about.  It has to be taken in the context of section 2 (2) of the Second Schedule which says:</P>
      <P>The chairman shall be appointed by the Minister and may be removed from office by the Minister.</P>
      <P>That is the power to hire and fire.  We simply do not accept that and we will be putting this amendment to a vote.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 26, after &ldquo;represented&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in each individual group elected or nominated as members to the governing body under the relevant subsections&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks further improvement in the gender equity clause.  The Minister has travelled a considerable distance down the road towards recognising a need to build in gender equity, which is very much in keeping with the spirit of what he has announced in the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (5) states:</P>
      <P>In making appointments to a governing body pursuant to <i>subsection (4)</i> of this section the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented and shall ensure an appropriate gender balance as determined by the Minister from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that provision is very welcome it is rather bland.  The Minister has taken unto himself the role of vigilante to ensure that at the end of the day gender equity is achieved.  I submit that the global composition of the governing body could have the presentation of gender equity without actually having gender equity as such.  There is a need for a reinforcing clause stating that each group nominating representatives to the governing body should have gender equity within their nominating component. Thus a component of two nominees should be made up of a man and a woman, a component of four nominees should have two men and two women and a component of six nominees should have three men and three women.  The ratio should be maintained in each and every group of representatives.  I therefore <Col N="2182" /> ask the Minister to take on board this amendment, which seeks to insert after the word &ldquo;represented&rdquo; the words &ldquo;in each individual group elected or nominated as members to the governing body under the relevant subsections&rdquo;. The point has been made that there will be six persons representative of the local authority who will be nominated by the vocational education committee.  It could happen &mdash; although it is unlikely unless there were a major change in attitude &mdash; that those six nominees could be female. On the other hand, it could happen that the nominating organisations decided to nominate five men.  From those 11 nominees there would be six females, nominated by the vocational education committee, and five males, nominated by the nominating organisations.</P>
    <P>It is important to provide that every single component group should have within it a gender equity balance, and that is what this amendment tries to achieve.  In other words, without saying that the six persons nominated by the vocational education committee have to be three men and three women, there should be as near as possible to gender equity and a recognition that at least some of the members nominated should be female.  Of the two nominated representatives of the academic staff an effort should be made to have one male and one female; the two students nominated should again be one male and one female; a balance should be achieved within the five persons nominated by nominating organisations.  Gender balance within each nominating component is very desirable.  The overall composition of the entire governing body should be right.  I hope that the Minister accepts the spirit of the amendment and what we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins and I tabled this amendment in an effort not only to clarify the gender balance but also to copperfasten it.  Deputy Higgins has outlined that very clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage we tabled amendments in which we specified clearly, by using the terminology &ldquo;one of <Col N="2183" /> which must be a woman&rdquo;, our desire to achieve gender balance.  The Minister met us part of the way by saying that he would ensure gender balance.  We want to guard against a possible development in which gender balance on the governing body might be achieved in reality but not in essence in that there is not gender balance within each component making up the governing body.  Each representative body should have to ensure gender balance.  The matter of gender equity should not be considered only in the context of the entirety of the governing body.  That is important when one takes into account the people who will be represented on the governing body.  It is only realistic, logical and fair to argue that the representatives of the academic staff, the students and the vocational education committee should have gender balance.  The balance should not be swayed in favour of either gender in any one component.  While this amendment does not overstate the issue it does clarify and copperfasten it.  The amendment provides not for overall gender balance but for gender balance within each component that will nominate people to the governing body.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister to accept this amendment because he has very clearly indicated his desire to achieve gender balance on the governing body.  The amendment seeks to ensure still further that each component nominated on the governing body has a gender balance.  It must be recognised that each of those groups represents the interests of different parties.  I hope the Minister accepts the amendment, which would be an important addition to his commitment to achieve gender balance on the governing body.</P>

      <P>I think we are trying to do the same thing in different ways. To my knowledge, this is the first Bill &mdash; and I am open to correction on this point &mdash; to seek to write gender balance into legislation.  I consider it important that that be done in a very flexible way while at the same time making the provision <Col N="2184" /> effective.  Section 6 (5) places a statutory duty on the Minister to make sure that there is gender balance on the governing body.  I am satisfied that the provision as drafted is the proper way to achieve that at this time.</P>
      <P>The earlier amendments tabled by Deputies sought to achieve gender balance for the staff representatives only, which was probably an oversight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has now been suggested that that should be carried right down the line, which is what I talked about in my response.  I still think that the legislation as drafted provides a better method of achieving gender balance. When the overall list goes to the Minister he or she will have a statutory duty to ensure gender balance across the entire governing body.  As I have said publicly in the House &mdash; and I am sure that future Ministers for Education would take the same view &mdash; the list would have to be returned if gender balance was not clearly visible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly I can undertake in the House to bring this provision formally to the notice of the vocational education committees, the staff, the students and the other constituents of the governing body, so that before those components make their appointments they will know that if the overall governing body does not meet the statutory requirement their section of the nominated list could be returned in the same way as the entire list could be returned.  I would not be disposed to making a requirement that each particular component should achieve gender balance; even though the aspiration is laudable, such a provision would be too rigid given that this is the first ever attempt in legislation to come to grips with gender balance.  I am convinced that the method proposed can be effective. I undertake to bring specifically to the attention of the nominating groups, in advance of the various constituents comprising the governing body making their nominations or holding elections, the statutory duty on the Minister to have <Col N="2185" /> gender balance.  I, and I am sure future Ministers, would have no hesitation in returning the entire list if it did not make a genuine effort to achieve such a balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to what the Members who put down the amendment are seeking to achieve.  There are practical difficulties in achieving a gender balance.  I find the term in the Bill &ldquo;appropriate gender balance&rdquo; one of those nebulous concepts the meaning of which is difficult to understand and it is down to the judgment of the Minister of the day.  With the ICTU representative it has to be one or the other and that body will decide whether it is to be a man or a woman.  The same applies to the director, and to the chairperson over whose appointment the Minister has jurisdiction &mdash; not that we agree with that.</P>
      <P>As regards the academic staff and the student representatives there is a clear case for saying one and one; the academic staff would have male and female nominees to the board following their elections. I can see difficulties with the five others.  A vocational education committee may nominate five bodies and ask for, say, representatives and they can represent either/or; they can send a man or a woman.  The clear-cut areas are the staff and students.  Also vocational education committees may not have sufficient female members.  In a number of vocational education committees there could be difficulty in getting three nominees, and not much can be done about that.  The case of the academic nominees and staff nominees is clear-cut, one can direct that there be male and female in both cases.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> This amendment seeks to delete all words after &ldquo;governing body&rdquo;.  At present the subsection provides that: &ldquo;The acts of a committee established under this section shall be subject to confirmation by the governing body unless the governing body dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation&rdquo;.  Deputy Ahearn and I make the point that it is not good practice to dispense with such a requirement.  If a committee or subcommittee are set up that committee or subcommittee are subservient to the primary or parent body and there should be an automatic reporting back process.  There should be no question whatever of dispensing with such a requirement.  In the interests of safeguarding everything that happens from the point of view of what the Minister is streamlining we should retain this section.  Where a subcommittee or committee are established under this section to perform a particular function it should be automatic that in such cases these report back to the governing body as a matter of course.</P>

    <P>This amendment, which I think will go a substantial distance to reassuring the vocational education committees and the <Col N="2189" /> IVEA as to their position, is responding to amendments tabled by Deputies O'Shea, Higgins, Garland, Ahearn and Mac Giolla throughout this Bill.  The amendment would have the effect of requiring the governing body to have regard to the statutory responsibility of the vocational education committee in the provision of vocational and technical education.  I hope it clarifies my approach to this matter.  I should like to emphasise that the respective roles of the colleges and the vocational education committees are changing.  Even though we are trying to get a balance in these Bills, it will be essential throughout the period of the preparation of the Green Paper that the vocational education committees and I &mdash; and the educational world at large &mdash; discuss frankly and courageously the future of the vocational education committees and what type, if any, of local educational authorities we require.  I will keep an open mind in that regard until I engage in debate with the various bodies over the next six months.  In responding to the request from the vocational education committees and the IVEA and by agreeing to include this section, on which I know they are very keen, I again invite them to have an open, honest and frank debate with me in the months ahead so that we can chart a proper future for the vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment tabled by the Minister. Indeed, as a former teacher in a vocational education school and a firm believer in the ethos of vocational education, I welcome the fact that the Minister is enshrining this in the Bill.  For too long the ethos, aspiration and commitment to technical education has been somewhat diluted and it is good, welcome and acceptable that the Minister has taken this step to ensure that the ethos, although aspirational, will continue in our regional technical colleges.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Minister tabled this vitally important amendment, mainly because the question of apprenticeships had not been included <Col N="2190" /> in the Bill.  However, on Committee Stage the Minister told the House he accepted that the functions of the college to provide vocational and technical education and training included apprenticeships. The amendment ensures that the area of apprenticeships for which vocational education committees have responsibility will be accepted as part of the functions of the colleges.  In performing their functions the governing body shall have regard to the statutory responsibilities in the provision of vocational and technical education of the vocational education committee.  We were worried about the vocational education committees not having control and not being able to make recommendations because of the importance of the link between second and third level colleges. However, that will be provided for in this section.  It is the statutory responsibility of the vocational education committees in the second level area to ensure that there is a link and that as many as possible move on to third level.  This section will allow the vocational education committees to have that input in regard to those apprenticeships and the link with second level education.</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 19 to 49, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.  &mdash;(1) If&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Minister is satisfied that the functions of the governing body of a college are not being duly and effectively discharged, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  a governing body wilfully neglects to comply with any order, direction or regulation of the Minister <Col N="2191" /> made or given in pursuance of the provisions of this Act, or</P>
    <P>(c)  a governing body fails to comply with any judgment or order of any court of competent jurisdiction,</P>
    <P>the Minister may, after consultation with the vocational education committee, by order dissolve the governing body.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister makes an order dissolving a governing body the Minister may transfer its functions to any body of persons.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister shall by order provide for the re-establishment of a governing body dissolved under subsection (1) and for the appointment of members thereto in accordance with section 6 of this Act not later than one year following the dissolution and when the new governing body has been appointed the functions of the dissolved governing body shall be revested in the new governing body and shall cease to be functions of the body of persons to whom they were transferred under the said subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage a number of Deputies raised issues regarding aspects of section 8 of the Bill as initiated.  This amendment deletes the section of the Bill as initiated and substitutes a new section 8.  Amendments Nos. 44-49, inclusive, propose various changes.  Section 8 (1) (b) now provides that orders and so on will be those given in pursuance of the provision of the Act, not just general orders, which tightens the section.  When a governing body are dissolved the section now provides for the appointment of a body of persons to perform the functions of the governing body.  Deputies will remember that the Bill, as initiated, provided for the transfer to any person or persons &mdash; in other words, if the governing body were dissolved the Minister could transfer the functions to one person.  I am now insisting that the Minister must transfer it to a body of persons. <Col N="2192" /> It is a cumbersome phrase but I am advised that it is the best one legally. That will improve the section.</P>
    <P>The new section will also provide that the governing body must be re-established within one year of their dissolution. Previously the governing body had to be re-established within the end of the second year but we are now reducing that period to one year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the reshaped substitute amendment in the name of the Minister.  There is certainly a difference of emphasis; a governing body having been removed, the Minister is putting a group of persons in their place.  In the original section 8 (2) the Minister could from time to time remove all or any such persons and appoint others in their place and could fix the tenure of office, duties and remuneration of all such persons.  That phraseology is not in the new section.  Subsection (3) of the original section said that the remuneration, if any, of every person appointed under subsection (2) shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas under section 15.  I presume that remuneration is not involved because I cannot see a reference to it in the new section.  We welcome the insertion of &ldquo;not later than one year&rdquo; which is an improvement on the original subsection (4) which stated &ldquo;not later than the end of the second year following the dissolution&rdquo;. We hope that the Minister is referring to the first half of the year rather than, as originally debated, to the end of the second year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the Minister's amendment states that whenever the Minister makes an order dissolving a governing body the Minister may transfer their functions to any body of persons. That term &ldquo;any body of persons&rdquo; is a rather loose phrase.  What type of body of persons is envisaged by the Minister? Is he talking about non-sinning members of a vocational education committee?  Is he talking about a collection of people comprising, for example, the chief executive officers of the principal vocational education committee and the other conshape <Col N="2193" /> stituent vocational education committees? What kind of a group of vocational people is the Minister referring to as an <i>ad hoc</i> group to keep the show on the road pending the appointment of his new replacement governing body?</P>

      <P>Section 8 of the Bill states &ldquo;the Minister may, after consultation with the vocational education committee, by order, remove the members of the governing body from office&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 46 seeks to delete the words &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;on the recommendation of&rdquo; because the reference to consultation means nothing.  The Minister will only be required to consult with the vocational education committee, who can state their objections.  However, he will still be able to say that, despite these, he is going to remove the members of the governing body from office.  I believe therefore that is essential to include this amendment which seeks to include the words &ldquo;on the recommendation of&rdquo; to weaken the ministerial power.  On an earlier amendment Deputy <Col N="2194" /> Higgins dealt with the power to hire and fire the chairperson and in this case we are dealing with the power to hire and fire the members of the governing body from office.</P>

Amendment No. 44, which is in my name and that of Deputy O'Shea, seeks to insert the words &ldquo;of the vocational education committee&rdquo; in subsection (1) (b), which deals with the dissolution of the governing body.  If my amendment were to be accepted this subsection would read as follows &ldquo;if a governing body wilfully neglects to comply with any lawful order of the vocational education committee, direction or regulation of the Minister ...&rdquo; Again, this would improve the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 45, which is in my name and that of Deputy O'Shea, is identical to amendment No. 46, which is in the name of Deputy Mac Giolla, except that Deputy O'Shea and I use the indefinite article while Deputy Mac Giolla uses the definite article.  I am sure that we can reach agreement to avoid the need for a prolonged debate.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  Leaving the semantics aside, it is important that the principle be accepted.  I put it to the Minister that the wording of his amendment, which includes the phrase &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo;, is not strong enough and that the word &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; should be used.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 47, subsection (1) of the Bill reads &ldquo;the Minister may, after consultation with the vocational education committee, by order remove the members of the governing body from office and direct the nomination and recommendation of new members&rdquo;.  We suggest that the words &ldquo;the appointment&rdquo; should be inserted as it is a better phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also believe that amendment No. 48 <Col N="2195" /> which is in my name and which would substitute the words &ldquo;the vocational education committee&rdquo; for &ldquo;any person or persons&rdquo;, would improve the Bill. Finally, amendment No. 49, which is in my name and those of Deputies Mac Giolla and O'Shea, seeks to delete subsection (2) of the Bill.  That subsection deals with a situation where an order is made under the section to dissolve a governing body.  It states that &ldquo;the Minister may appoint such and so many persons as the Minister thinks fit&rdquo;.  It would be better however if that subsection were omitted from the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I wish to remind the Minister that my colleague, Deputy Higgins, mentioned that the wording is too loose.

      <P>In general the amendment the Minister has tabled will improve the Bill.  The new section 7 (6) states &ldquo;in performing its functions a governing <Col N="2196" /> body shall have regard to the statutory responsibilities in the provision of vocational and technical education of the vocational education committee&rdquo;.  For instance, if a vocational education committee decide that the governing body of a regional technical college are not paying due regard, as directed in the subsection, to the statutory responsibilities of a vocational education committee, could this be constituted as a lawful order of the vocational education committee? The term &ldquo;lawful order&rdquo; is retained in the new section 8 (1).  The role of the vocational education committee should be strengthened.</P>
      <P>The question of who will act in the interim once a governing body has been dissolved has been raised.  Deputy Higgins has also questioned the use of the term &ldquo;any body of persons&rdquo; which is very unwieldy.  Surely a more appropriate or precise form of words could be used.  On a previous amendment I advanced the argument that the Minister should dissolve a governing body on the recommendation of the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>In that instance the body that would perform the functions and duties of the governing body in the interim period would be the vocational education committee. The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; has been deleted from this section in relation to who should perform the functions of the governing body during the one year period or part thereof when there would be no governing body in place.  I suggest to the Minister that there must be more precise wording for inclusion in section 8 (2) than &ldquo;any body of persons&rdquo;.  It avoids the position where one person could act in the place of the governing body in the interim and in that sense it is an improvement, but I would prefer if the Minister could include the role of the vocational education committee as sought in the amendment tabled by Deputy Garland and myself.  I am very unhappy with the wording &ldquo;any body of persons&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I agree with my colleagues <Col N="2197" /> that the amendment is an improvement on the original, but in amendment No. 43 I believe what we are substituting is a disimprovement on the existing text because of the loose terminology. The wording gives a connotation that just anybody, irrespective of their aptitude or capabilities can take on the role when a governing body has to be replaced.  I refer the Minister to the Bill where it states:</P>
      <P>When an order is made under this section dissolving a governing body the Minister may appoint such and so many persons as the Minister thinks fit to perform the functions of the governing body.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister should retain that text rather than section 8 (2) of amendment 43: whenever the Minister makes an order dissolving a governing body the Minister may transfer its functions to any body of persons&rdquo;.  The text of the original Bill is more apt and provides that the Minister has to consider that the persons are fit and are capable of replacing the governing body.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendments Nos. 44 and 45 I hesitate to support them.  I wonder would the vocational education committee want the power of recommendation to dissolve the governing body as their own six nominees are members of it.  Is it more realistic to say that the Minister would dissolve the governing body in consultation with the vocational education committee?  I ask the Minister in regard to the dissolution of the governing body, have the vocational education committee the power of veto?  I would like an answer, yes or no, to that.</P>

      <P>The vocational education committee have no veto on dissolution. Regarding amendment No. 45 addressed by Deputy Mac Giolla which proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo; and the substitution of the words &ldquo;can recommendation of&rdquo;, the Minister appoints the board legally; the dissolution of the governing body would be a doomsday situation, I do not <Col N="2198" /> envisage it happening, it is really an almost unthinkable and rare situation where something would be so seriously wrong that a member or the entire governing body would have to be removed. Given that throughout the Bill the Minister confirms the appointments, I think, therefore, it would have to fall to the Minister to make the final decision to remove the person or persons.  The vocational education committee have to be consulted but they would not have to make a recommendation on the matter. The requirement of a recommendation could be difficult and, given the strong vocational education committee involvement in the governing body of the college, it really should fall to somebody who is not involved to judge whether the entire governing body should be dissolved. It is most unlikely that this situation would arise but if there was some serious difficulty with the governing body one could speculate that the vocational education committee would have to be part of that difficulty.  Therefore, the recommendation would not be made by the vocational education committee because this would require them in effect to clean up their own house, and could result in an internal investigation.  It is more appropriate that the Minister who is apart from the entire governing body should be empowered to make the recommendation after consultation.  It is unthinkable that anyone in the vocational education committee would misbehave themselves but in the unlikely event of it happening they should stand back from it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Garland referred to the lawful order and he proposed that the lawful order should also apply to the vocational education committee, that if the governing body refused a lawful order of the vocational education committee they should be removed.  The Bill provides that the governing body must comply with any lawful order of the Minister.  The same comments as I made <Col N="2199" /> to Deputy Mac Giolla would apply in this case.  There are also non-VEC personnel on the governing body and to give the vocational education committee the authority to remove non-VEC members would be giving them authority beyond what was intended.  Therefore, I do not think this wording should be included.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne and others are concerned about the Minister's enormous power, that he may ramble into pubs and appoint people to posts left, right and centre.  This provides for a doomsday situation. The legal phraseology recommended to us is that the Minister may appoint any body of persons as the Minister thinks fit to perform the functions. This is an interim arrangement for 12 months in the very rare circumstances occurring somebody has to make the decision as they think fit.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;were suggested to me legally.  I do not think the words are very elegant either, but the wording &ldquo;any body of persons&rdquo; overcomes the original notion that a person could be appointed meaning one appointment only could be made but now a number of appointments would have to be made or a group of persons would have to be appointed.  The legal advice I have is the wording &ldquo;any body of persons&rdquo; is better phrase and it has been tried and tested.

      <P>In page 9, line 6, to delete &ldquo;determined&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;approved&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 9 (2), which reads:</P>
      <P>(2)  The selection of the Director shall be a function of the governing body in accordance with the procedures, which shall include the composition of a selection board, determined by the Minister from time to time.</P>
      <P>The reason it is sought to substitute the word &ldquo;approved&rdquo; here for the word &ldquo;determined&rdquo; is that the composition of the selection board is something we would envisage being decided by the membership of the governing body &mdash; in other words, that the governing body would make a proposal to the Minister as to the composition of a selection board, seeking ministerial approval, rather than having the Minister determine the composition of or type of selection board who would select the director.  That is the rationale behind this amendment.</P>

      <P>We support this amendment.  We all envisage that the composition of a selection board, as happens at present, would be comprised of members of the governing board and would have ministerial approval.  The use of the word &ldquo;determined&rdquo; gives an impression of the Minister recommending a selection board and proceeding <Col N="2201" /> in that manner.  I believe that the substitution of the word &ldquo;approved&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;determined&rdquo; is a move in the right direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are endeavouring to do here through the use of the word &ldquo;determined&rdquo; is not that each individual board would be determined in the case of each appointment but that there would be a general determination of the composition of the board, not the names of the people but the types of persons and the constituencies of interest from which they would come, so many from each organisation or group of academics and so on.  The intention is that the Minister of the day would determine that list.  I must stress that it would not be the names and it would not be in respect of each individual case.  It would be the same, say, as the Minister or the Dáil now determining the make-up of the governing body.  We are not dealing with names; we are merely stipulating the sectors of interest from which they would come.  In such a critical choice as the selection of the director it might be wise that they be a representative group and that that be determined in advance by an outside authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand exactly what the Minister is saying.  He is talking about advance signalling of the criteria to be used for the composition of the selection board.  Nevertheless, the general feeling would appear to be that the word &ldquo;determined&rdquo; is somewhat stronger than is generally perceived.  This is very much in keeping with the reservations expressed at earlier stages of the debate in relation to ministerial powers.  I can see that the Minister is using the word &ldquo;determined&rdquo; to stipulate the ground rules.  Although we cannot deal with it at this stage, I suggest that the terminology &ldquo;recommended by the Minister&rdquo; might be a more conciliatory term that might be considered when the Bill goes before the Seanad for approval.  I contend that the word &ldquo;approved&rdquo; implies something of a subsequent nature; that having seen and examined, one then approves a <i>fait <Col N="2202" /> accompli</i>, rather than &ldquo;determined&rdquo;, which is a type of pre-emptive phrase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic, but I think on balance I had better adhere to the word &ldquo;determined&rdquo;.  My information is that it does not have that heavy-handed legal interpretation.  It means, as it were, &ldquo;decides&rdquo; as opposed to heavily laying down the law on the question.  It is a thin line, but it does not have that heavy handed legal interpretation.  It means that the Minister must be satisfied, must lay down the criteria in advance in regard to the sectors from which the various members of the selection board will come.  On balance, I would prefer to stay with it.</P>

      <P>I do not believe there is any great distance between the Minister and those of us on this side of the House in relation to section 9 (2), which reads:</P>
      <P>(2)  The selection of the Director shall be a function of the governing body in accordance with the procedures, which shall include the composition of a selection board, determined by the Minister from time to time.</P>
      <P>I take that to mean that the governing body can go outside in terms of nominating people to the selection board? Whereas uniformity among selection boards of all regional technical colleges in the selection of the director is in many ways attractive, it could well be that there would be serving on particular governing bodies people of particular expertise, possibly people who would have had much experience as personnel managers or whatever.  Does the Minister envisage that the procedures, as determined by him, could prevent a specific governing body from appointing their whole selection board from the five nominees of the vocational education committees?</P>

      <P>In page 9, lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;appointed by the governing body&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are seeking to recast section 10 (1) so that it will then read:</P>
      <P>Each college shall have an academic council to assist it in the planning, coordination, development and overseeing of the educational work of the college.</P>
      <P>We contend that the matter of whether the governing body should appoint the academic council is very much open to question.  Deputy O'Shea's amendment No. 55 suggests that members of the governing body shall be wholetime holders of academic appointments within the college, that at least one shall be elected by the wholetime members of the staff of the college voting as a body.  The composition of the academic council is important.</P>
      <P>We accept the spirit of what the Minister proposes in his amendment No. 52, which proposes the insertion of the words &ldquo;and to protect, maintain and develop the academic standards of the courses and the activities of the college&rdquo;.  A doubt or anxiety we have is who exactly should nominate the members of the academic council.</P>

      <P>Our amendment was tabled with a view to eliciting information.</P>
      <P>Our amendment No. 53 seeks the deletion of the word &ldquo;membership&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of the words &ldquo;number of members&rdquo;.  Section 10 (2) (a) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each governing body may by regulations made under this section provide <Col N="2204" /> for the membership and terms of office of the academic council.</P>
    <P>That terminology gives the impression that the governing body will not alone decide the number of members but also who they should be.  It is for that reason we believe that the word &ldquo;membership&rdquo; should be replaced by the words &ldquo;number of members&rdquo;.  After all, the members of the academic council should be elected, not decided on or selected by the governing body.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 54 proposes to delete the words &ldquo;majority of&rdquo; so that section 10 (2) (b) would provide &ldquo;The members shall be holders of academic appointments within the college and at least one shall be a registered student of the college&rdquo;. That is not too much to ask.  We are, after all, talking about an academic council and one would expect that it should include holders of academic appointments.  We have also provided that one should be a registered student of the college.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept those amendments which I believe will not only improve the section but lead to a better academic council.  This is a most important element of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  The council will have an enormous say on what will be provided for within the council and it is most important that it should consist of members who are able to provide good academic advice.  It is for that reason that we propose that all the members shall be holders of academic appointments within the college with the provision that at least one should be a registered student.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments moved by Deputies Ahearn and Higgins.  My amendment No. 55 would mean that the section would be as follows: &ldquo;The members shall be holders of academic appointments within the college and at least one shall be a registered student of the college elected by the wholetime members of the academic staff in the college voting as a body for this purpose&rdquo;.  In the context of electing the academic council, a universal franchise is <Col N="2205" /> very important because, at the end of the day, the real freedom is academic freedom.  However, if we do not put together a mechanism which allows for a full and democratic input from the whole staff, we will have lost an opportunity because the governing body could, in particular instances, decide to set up the election procedure for the academic council in a way that could effectively debar considerable numbers among the staff from having any role in the appointment of the academic council.  It is for this reason that I have put down an amendment seeking that the universal franchise would apply within the college.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister indicated a number of reasons why he felt that a universal franchise was inappropriate. The functions of the academic council as stated in section 10 (3) (a) is &ldquo;to design, develop and assist in implementing courses of study in accordance with the programmes and budget approved annually under section 13 of this Act&rdquo;.  In the context of the vibrancy of the colleges and of the input of all the academic staff to the academic council, making the election process for the academic council too restrictive would be a retrograde step which would not be in the best interests of the college and, more importantly, of the students.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to give sympathetic and full consideration to this group of amendments.</P>

      <P>This amendment and related amendments Nos. 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 and 61 provide that some or all of the members of the academic council should be elected by the academic staff. I would be totally opposed to the concept of the academic council being elected.  I think that is going too far.  The governing body consists largely of elected students, staff, probably the vocational education committee members and, indirectly, the organisation members who are probable elected by their organisation.  There is, therefore, a very substantial amount of electioneering and democracy at that level.  We are talking here about the academic council, a body of persons who <Col N="2206" /> are charged with maintaining academic standards and in universities, for example, who would tend to be heads of departments, heads of the schools and senior academic personnel.</P>
      <P>The section only lays down that a majority shall be holders of academic appointments and one shall be a registered student.  That gives some flexibility to include others in the academic council. I honestly feel that there is very substantial democracy here.  Frankly, I think the college would not get around to doing much work if it was going to spend the entire year electing everybody &mdash; that is not the real reason, just an aside.  An academic council is a committee appointed by the governing body &mdash; not necessarily members of it &mdash; charged with maintaining academic standards, and that is better undertaken coolly, away from campaigns by a group of academics with some input from non-academics who take on the responsibility of maintaining academic standards in the college.  It would be entirely inappropriate to turn that particular quality control function into an election campaign.  I know that Deputies may disagree strongly with me but there is a great deal of democracy at the level of the governing body and the academic council need to be able to operate in a cool atmosphere and not be elected around the side of the governing body and maybe in some way causing tensions with the governing body because they, too, have a mandate.  I feel it would be very disruptive.  That is something one could look at in future legislation but in this instance, given that we are putting in newly elected governing bodies, it would be wiser to have that body make their own decision on who should take charge of academic quality control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins asked me who should be on the academic council.  That is covered by the section.  In regard to whom else they might appoint, there is no reason why they could not appoint academics from other institutions, for example, external examiners, persons with an academic or technical background whom they felt could bring some academic distinction to the academic <Col N="2207" /> council.  When I say academic I mean it in its broader sense not excluding the technical side.  That would be my response to that group of amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Minister is trying to do.  He is trying to allow as much discretion as possible but it does seem an extraordinarily loose section. We have prescribed the number of people on the governing body, yet there is no prescription in relation to the number of people on the academic council. Are we talking about five, ten, 15, 20 or what number?  We are saying that the governing body should not appoint the academic council as is enshrined in section 10 (1) but that it should be <Col N="2208" /> elected.  We do not believe that the practice of electioneering will permeate throughout the college.  Amendment No. 53 proposes that the governing body will prescribe the number of members and their terms of office but will not handpick the people who will determine the academic standards.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Sellafield Nuclear Plant: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Howlin on Tuesday 30 June 1992:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann reiterates its previous condemnation of the operations of the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. plant at Sellafield in the UK and, in particular, condemns the proposal to extend and develop that plant further; and calls on the Government</P>
    <P>&mdash;to outline in full all actions taken to secure the closure of the Sellafield plant and, in particular, all actions taken to prevent further development of the plant,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to prepare and initiate a campaign of representation through every possible forum, including the European Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the Anglo-Irish Conference, and contacts between relevant Departments here and in the United Kingdom with the object of securing the closure of Sellafield and,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to outline any and all legal advice it has obtained in this matter, and to indicate what legal action, if any, it proposes to take.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann approves the actions taken to date by the Government with a view to the eventual closure of the Sellafield plant and in the meantime to ensure the safe operation and the safe storage of nuclear waste now in the plant.  In particular, Dáil Éireann notes that the Government has fully and carefully investigated the possibility of legal action to secure closure of the plant and that the Government has been advised that a firm legal case, based on sufficient evidence as to the injurious effects on Ireland of operations at the Sellafield plant, does not exist at present.  Dáil Éireann notes the commitment of the Government to continue its efforts to secure closure of the Sellafield plant.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Flaherty for sharing her time with me. Sadly, this very important issue has to be raised in this House time and again. At regular intervals the state of the Irish Sea becomes the issue when alarming findings are brought to our notice.  On 20 May 1992 we raised on the Adjournment the issue of radioactive substances in the Irish Sea and the reported incidence of radioactive vegetation off the Sellafield coast.  We also raised the serious implications of the suppression of those findings until the information was leaked to the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Labour Party for tabling this motion as it gives us the opportunity to address the serious question <Col N="2215" /> of reliable information backed up by scientific knowledge.  Again and again our experience has been punctuated by the suppression and distortion of information relating to the Sellafield plant. There is a general belief outside this House that there is a great need for an independent highly skilled scientific agency, if not at Irish level at European level, that would act as an honest broker on our behalf and would seek to protect not only human life but our flora and fauna.</P>
    <P>We have two major problems, first the actual discovery of radioactive vegetation; second, the added worry caused by the realisation that we are not getting the whole story or learning all the truth and that matters are being covered up in every sense of the word.  The recent reported incidence of radioactive vegetation off the Cumbrian coast showed how the information was suppressed and highlighted the fact that skilled scientific staff attached to Sellafield had discovered this two months prior to the information being leaked to the press.  It was established that new plant life resulted from the effluent of a nuclear installation such as Sellafield.</P>
    <P>We are seriously concerned that Sellafield not only affects the land and coastland around it but also people across the Irish Sea.  Irish people reject not only nuclear waste but the generation of energy by nuclear plants and did so even when we were told it was the solution to our energy problem.  Irish people have a deep-seated fear of nuclear installations and the people rejected the idea of building a nuclear plant on our own shores even if it was to our short term advantage, Therefore, it is all the more unacceptable that we have to live with the effects of the waste from the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>I hope that by raising this matter again in the House we will strengthen our structures as we become aware of the dangers. I hope we will become more skilled at evaluating the damage that Sellafield has done and will continue to do.  We have a tremendous opportunity at present to harness the EC conventions and our <Col N="2216" /> legislation to ensure that if we take on Sellafield, we can win.  We always knew it was going to be difficult to prove things because of the need for objective scientific conclusions that could be used legally. We also realised that as a small nation we were taking on our larger neighbour which had pledged itself during the previous Conservative Government to nuclear energy.  It was like David taking on Goliath.  However, the European Community must exercise a collective role and give us access to independent scientific information and must ensure that Sellafield is effectively monitored so that we can take appropriate action.  Above everything else, the EC must support us in seeking to change the rules.</P>
    <P>As a result of the recent global summit and the resultant oceans treaties we now realise the inter-dependence of all systems on our planet and how one is responsible for polluting or preserving the other.  This gives us a powerful case to make.  We also know that the eco-system is responsible for all marine life and this also affects the planet which will be under threat if waste from Sellafield is allowed to be discharged into the Irish Sea.  The launching of the EUREKA programme on marine science and technology, with accompanying law at European level, has to be a priority. Europe has to see it in that light and should have the moral as well as environmental responsibility to bring this about.</P>
    <P>I know that our real weakness &mdash; and other speakers will refer to this &mdash; in this specialised area, where there is a great suppression or distortion of the facts, is that we have to shift the burden of proof, as has been done in other areas where this problem arises.  It is no longer acceptable that we should have to prove that emissions from Sellafield are environmentally damaging.  We should not have to prove that those emissions have had the effects that historically they have done.  The burden of proof will have to be shifted so that Sellafield will have to prove to us openly and beyond doubt that what they are doing and what they plan to do will not damage the environment and will not <Col N="2217" /> cause a deterioration of the waters of the Irish Sea and the vegetation of the surrounding eco-system.  If that were written into law and conventions we would have the answer to legally advance our cause for closing down Sellafield. That burden of proof would have to demonstrate that no other alternative exists for dealing with nuclear waste and that such dumping has no harmful or adverse effects.  I believe that Sellafield would fail on both points if and when &mdash; and hopefully it will be &ldquo;when&rdquo;&mdash; they are asked to prove that.</P>
    <P>I ask that this motion not be one of a regular interest that we take up in the House but that collectively all sides of the House, with our shared experience and with our roles and responsibilities at world level and at European level, can put together a case that would hold and would prove beyond doubt that it is no longer acceptable or environmentally or legally tenable for Sellafield to continue what it is doing now, much less get away with what it is promising in the way of increased operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most Deputies are at one in relation to a view on nuclear power.  I have been concerned recently to hear several Opposition Deputies say that they favour a carbon tax.  Their statements disturb me somewhat because although we have to conserve our use of energy and ensure that the production of carbon dioxide &mdash; the main greenhouse gas causing global warming &mdash; is curtailed, if we were to have a carbon tax in isolation from other energy taxes a huge advantage would be given to nuclear-based countries.  That is one of the main concerns expressed time and time again by the Irish Government at international fora.  As Members know, the Commission have proposals in relation to a 50-50 tax on carbon and energy.  Although those proposals are at a very initial stage, it is important when Deputies talk about the conservation of energy and the use of fiscal measures to do so that the advantage is not given to nuclear states.  I am very keen to make <Col N="2218" /> that point.  I do not wish to make a party political point out of that, but I did notice recently that some Opposition Deputies did not seem to take that view.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned about the operation of the Sellafield plant.  While the 1991 report of the Irish Nuclear Energy Board &mdash; now the Radiological protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; stated that the radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea were &ldquo;safe&rdquo; they also stated that the levels were &ldquo;undesirable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In October 1990 an advertisement from British Nuclear Fuels appeared in <i>The Sunday Times.</i> That advertisement is worthy of note in this debate.  It read:</P>
      <P>Where do you stand on nuclear power?  Well, wherever it is, one thing is for sure.  Nuclear waste cannot be ignored.  And just like the issue, it's unlikely to go away.  For the fact is, even if nuclear energy production ceased tomorrow, we would still have to deal with waste that has been produced in the past.</P>
      <P>The advertisement was apparently intended to convince anyone who had reservations about Sellafield that those doubts were unfounded.  Arguably, statements such as that fuelled people's fears rather than allaying them.</P>
      <P>According to British Nuclear Fuels, the vitrification process has been brought into operation, whereby high level waste can be reduced to one-third of its original volume.  A quotation from the company reads:</P>
      <P>Or, to look at it another way, all the high level waste produced at Sellafield in the last 30 years could be contained in just 4 double-decker buses.</P>
      <P>With respect to British Nuclear Fuels, I would suggest that that is not very consoling because there would not be too many queues to get on those buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Kingdom Government have ignored two sets of advice from their own experts, each of which independently showed that there are no compelling waste management reasons in favour of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from advanced gas-cooled reactors.  A <Col N="2219" /> team of eight consultants from the nuclear industry submitted a commissioned report to the UK Government in 1989, which report concluded that it would be preferable on environmental grounds to store spent fuel from nuclear reactors rather than to send it for reprocessing to the Sellafield plant in Cumbria. In the annual report of the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee published in November 1990 it was stated that the rationale for reprocessing had become more questionable in recent years.  I certainly share that view.</P>
    <P>Recently British Nuclear Fuels were reported in British newspapers as being &ldquo;mystified&rdquo;, &ldquo;baffled&rdquo; and &ldquo;puzzled&rdquo; when radioactive weed was found on beaches near Sellafield in May of this year.  At the time British Nuclear Fuels assured the public that the seaweed posed no danger and that someone would have to press the weed to his or her skin fo 30 hours before reaching the danger limit. Irish concern would very much focus on the reason for the weed being there in the first place rather than on its scientific properties.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know &mdash; and I think this matter was referred to last night &mdash; two test cases will open in the UK in October to determine whether radiation from Sellafield is likely to have caused childhood leukaemias.  About 40 other cases involving Cumbrian families await the outcome of those two cases.  Adult leukaemia rates along the north Lancashire coastline and the incidence of certain cancers along the west coast of Scotland in young people are reported to be three times the national average.</P>
    <P>It is important to make some suggestions in the context of this debate.  I have one suggestion that I hope will contribute to the debate in a meaningful way.  It might be a small step that the British authorities could take on board but could be a major step forward in terms of the developments that are to take place later this year.  In the light of the latest scientific and technical knowledge it would be prudent for the British Government to reassess the consent they gave in 1978 for <Col N="2220" /> the building and the operation of THORP, the nuclear thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield.  I say that because it is now almost 15 years since the Windscale inquiry, which was a very wideranging and comprehensive inquiry. Many things have changed in the time that has elapsed and I shall detail some of them.  On 27 June 1985 the EC adopted Directive 85/337, which was designed to deal with the environmental effects of certain public and private projects. Section 3 of that directive requires a description of the effects on fauna and flora of plutonium accumulation and post-flooding deposition in intertidal zones and estuaries around the Irish Sea. The directive requires a description of climatic factors affected by the emission of Krypton-85 and other radioactive gases.  It requires a description of the likely significant effects of the proposed project on the environment resulting from the emission of pollutants and the creation of nuisances.  I might add that it is anticipated &mdash; and not disputed, I understand &mdash; that the aerial emissions from Sellafield will increase by 1,000 per cent after the THORP plant comes into operation.</P>
    <P>Research published recently in the UK by authorities such as the Ministry for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and the Department of the Environment shows an increased accumulation of radioactivity in the intertidal zones on the mid-west coast of Britain.</P>
    <P>Plutonium and americium were found to contaminate the air, rain and land following a severe gale in North Wales in February 1990.  During the Windscale inquiry that possibility was predicted but was dismissed as being possible only under severe earthquake conditions.</P>
    <P>While evidence on the release of Krypton-85 was presented to the Windscale inquiry, virtually no reference was made to its potential climatic effect.  Studies conducted within the past decade are beginning to identify implications for the atmospheric electrical field from releases of artificially created ionising radiation and have raised serious questions on <Col N="2221" /> alternations in the relationship between the various aggregate states of water and the atmosphere.  British Nuclear Fuels do not intend to instal Krypton-85 retention technology on the grounds of unnecessary cost.  As I said, the emissions are going to increase by 1,000 per cent.</P>
    <P>The directive I referred to states that the environmental impact assessment should cover the direct effects of any indirect, secondary, cumulative, short, medium and long term, permanent and temporary, positive and negative effects of the project.  This certainly was not done in the context of the Windscale inquiry.  A recent study on the radioactive contamination in North Wales commissioned by the UK Inspectorate of Pollution discovered levels of 17,300 becquerels per square metre of plutonium and 15,300 becquerels of americium in the Dee estuary.  It has been calculated that there is to be a 554 billion increase of plutonium and 430 billion increase of americium in the intertidal region of North Wales already, mostly originating from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Using the USA Department of Energy safety limits, the total amount of americium-241 released so far represents the maximum permissible body burden for 11 million people and the amount of plutonium represents the maximum permissible body burden for four billion people.  If that is what has been caused already I suggest we need to do an environmental impact assessment in the light of the recent European Directive if we are even to begin to deal adequately with the kind of controls that have to be put into place at the power plant.  For example, birds are known to have abandoned the Ravenglass estuary as the plutonium levels increased, but no broadly based assessment has been carried out to establish if there is a connection between the two events or if additional radioactivity would have a deterimental effect.</P>
    <P>At the Windscale inquiry spokespersons for British Nuclear Fuels stated that no krypton control would be installed, for two reasons.  Firstly, they said that the technology of trapping the krypton from the dissolved gases is still <Col N="2222" /> in the development stage and they had not got the unit upon which they could base a design and construction programme. Secondly, they argued the cost. In his inquiry Mr. Justice Parker, referring to the emissions, said:</P>
    <P>With regard to krypton it is accepted by BFNL that the krypton removal plant will be incorporated if the technology for its removal and safe retention is available.  I am satisfied that it should.  I also consider that BNFL should not merely stand by and instal such a plant if and when others develop it.  They should themselves devote effort to its development.</P>
    <P>I will not go on at any great length because I know other Deputies want to share my time, but I think some of the things I have referred to are serious enough to require me and many of us to call on the British authorities to reconsider the basis on which consent is given and the kind of controls that might be put in place in the light of recent technical developments and the higher levels of environmental awareness and concern. Particularly given the sensitivity of transporting spent fuel, the shipping is to be carried out without prior notification of routes and times.  I believe that in accordance with international rules of the Atomic Energy Agency flasks were submitted to some tests at 800ºC for half an hour, but I understand that if a ship goes on fire it can burn for about 20 hours at temperatures far in excess of 800ºC. Obviously, the shipping of the spent fuel must be an intrinsic part of the operation at Sellafield.  British Nuclear Fuels argued at the Windscale inquiry that two thirds of the fuel would come from domestic sources and a third would be imported.  I understand now that up to the year 2000 two thirds of the fuel is to be imported, and therefore shipped, and after that all of it is to be imported.</P>
    <P>These matters are serious and therefore require a reassessment, particularly of the kind of technical controls and environmental standards that will apply to this plant when it is in operation later this year.  I do not think it an unreasonable <Col N="2223" /> request for Members of this House to require the British authorities who gave the consent almost 15 years ago, to review the basis on which that consent was given.  If an EIA were to be carried out it would require a base line study to establish the situation at the moment. That would be very helpful indeed, not just in ensuring that proper controls were in place but in reassuring the public that the British authorities are serious in ensuring that the plant is to operate to the highest possible environmental standards.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Liam Lawlor wishes to share time with me and, with the permission of the House, I propose to give him the remaining 15 minutes of my allocation.</P>

      <P>As chairman of ERDO, who ten years ago commissioned a study on this matter and had representations from Deputy Kavanagh's county and from along the east coast, I am concerned that we seem to be making little progress. Not alone are we not making progress but we are going in the wrong direction as regards the activities of Windscale, now Sellafield.  Despite EC Directives and Government commitments, we see unacceptable discharges into the sea which should now be the focus of our attention with hoped for substantial support from Europe.  Discharges from Sellafield into the atmosphere and the British coastal waters causes us great concern. We are aware of the mishaps and difficulties which followed the Chernobyl tragedy.  Free access to the former Soviet Union allows the media to report the effects of radioactive fallout and the damage it can do the population in the surrounding area, as well as to the soil and the waters and its many downstream effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to take up the time <Col N="2224" /> of the House going back over the very detailed content of the Minister's speech here last night and again this evening. There is a welter of technical detail highlighting the doubts, worries and unacceptability of what is proposed at Sellafield.  The generation of electricity by nuclear energy has been <i>in situ</i> at Sellafield for many years, but we must remember that taking that out of the UK grid has financial complications for that member state.  However, the reprocessing of spent nuclear rods and so on, hawking them thousands of miles around the world from Japan etc., highlights the fact that nowhere between Sellafield and Japan is there a similar facility, otherwise they would not be paying the shipping costs.</P>
    <P>What then are we collectively attempting to achieve?  At Community level, even when there was agreement that the inspectorate should resume activity, their lethargic performance so far in monitoring member states is particularly disappointing. Two or three inspections have been carried out and there seems to be a reluctance at Brussels level to tackle the question of co-operation among member states to deal with this matter. Some of the bigger member states have very substantial investments in nuclear energy and electricity generation by nuclear energy and there will not be a major fundamental shift in their policy. We understand that the UK at present are producing from that source at Sellafield. First, however, at Community level we must continue to attempt to establish that member states be responsible for their own activities in the area of toxic waste disposal.  Surely it is undesirable that materials for reprocessing at Sellafield are coming into the EC from as far away as Japan.  What about the International Law of the Sea?  Surely it is most undesirable to ship that material half way around the world.</P>
    <P>We appear to have all the right intentions, we are unanimous in our objections and yet we seem to be making very slow progress.  I presume the Attorney General will take an in-depth view of the court cases which will proceed in the <Col N="2225" /> autumn.  Are we supporting those cases? We need hard evidence in this regard; we all assume that water and air are polluted, the Minister referred to an estuary close to Sellafield which wildlife have abandoned because of their sensitivity to the atmosphere.  That factual information seems to be to hand yet it does not seem to be sufficiently coherent to bring it before the European or British court systems so that someone will be asked to call a halt.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister will meet twice yearly and this matter will have to be elevated to a high political level to get it to the stage where there will be agreement on environmental impact assessment so that at least the various interested parties would have to present the necessary information.  It has been said time and again that the lack of evidence has been a problem in bringing a legal case.  The evidence needed is probably in the documentation of Sellafield and while we may not have the necessary substantive evidence to proceed with a court case, the potential for discovery might unearth much of the information one is attempting to firmly establish.  We need to discover technical literature and information on discharges at Sellafield and all its other unacceptable aspects.</P>
    <P>There have been in-depth programmes in the United States on the Three Mile Island project which have shown the disastrous effects when things go wrong, including pollution of water and soil and the effects on people who live a substantial distance from the project.  It is a question of producing a foolproof list of measures to be taken.  I appreciate that this debate in Private Members' time gives us an opportunity to show our solidarity to the principle involved. However, when the debate is over will we have achieved anything by way of decisive action?  Will we have made progress towards achieving the principle we are trying to establish, to curtail further investment and activities at Sellafield? We must decide how we will handle a reactor built in 1956 and how it will be <Col N="2226" /> wound down safely and denuclearised&mdash; or whatever the technical terminology is.</P>
    <P>This matter should be on the agenda of meetings between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister as it is a major, fundamental environmental issue.  We are aware of the problems which can arise from Sellafield, the information has been available for a long time.  However, we do not seem to be able to twist the arms of the responsible bodies in the United Kingdom.  An initiative is needed to make the appropriate Ministers in the other capitals of Europe aware of our attitude to Sellafield.  At ministerial level there should be a small Cabinet sub-committee to co-ordinate foreign affairs, energy, environment and health from which a national action plan <i>vis-à-vis</i> Sellafield would emerge.  There should be a timeframe during which we hope to achieve what is desirable.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having further generalised discussions about what should be done.  There must be cohesive action at Cabinet and European Parliament level.  Greenpeace held a protest and various entertainers got in on the act, which is effective in media terms, but we know that the real decisions regarding such an important infrastructural investment in the energy network of the United Kingdom will not be overturned or terminated, as it is proposed to expand it according to the British Government and their various Departments.  It is undesirable, we do not want it but can we stop it? It is only at European and Government level that such a reversal of policy will be forced on the authorities of the United Kingdom.  That is the sort of decisive action which should emerge from the debate.  The Government have tabled an amendment to the motion, which will be supported by this side of the House. However, it is not enough.  Everybody is committed to the same aim.  Can we achieve it?  I sincerely hope so and I also hope that Government time will be made available in the autumn to allow us to reassess whether this debate has led to any real progress.  That is the sort of action which is necessary and I hope it will be taken sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>We are facilitating Democratic Left in this regard.  The debate so far has been schizophrenic because it has been like someone saying: &ldquo;Do not do what I do, do as I say&rdquo;.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, has obviously expressed deep concern and unhappiness in regard to the whole operation at Sellafield. Last night the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, said we were doing everything that we can and that we had raised the matter at every possible opportunity. However, one must wonder about the real thrust of the Government's actions because only last week increased emission levels were agreed by the Commission with regard to the THORP plant. Perhaps the Minister agreed because he was advised that the emissions were insignificant but, if we want to be consistent in regard to what we have been saying over the last number of years &mdash; in this House, in the Seanad and by the public &mdash; then at every opportunity we must make our unhappiness known about what is going on at Sellafield and the existence of that time bomb on our doorstep.  I do not think the Government are doing this. Neither do I want to be unrealistic <Col N="2228" /> because the chances are that, as a country, we will not be able to force the closure of the Sellafield plant.</P>
      <P>As a member of the environment committee of the British-Irish parliamentary body I visited the plant last year.  I recognise, having regard to the economic activity generated in Cumbria and to the fact that 15,000 people are directly employed in addition to the many thousands of people who live off the incomes earned at that plant, that it will not be easy to convince any British Government that they should shut the plant down and find alternative employment.  I share my constituency with a former Minister for Energy, Deputy Burke, who availed of every opportunity to declare, including statements in local papers, that it was his desire to have Sellafield shut down.</P>
      <P>While it comes down to a question of &ldquo;do as I say but not do as I do&rdquo; it seems we are not getting the message across.  In 1986, this House passed a motion which has not been overturned.  That motion called for the closure of the plant at Sellafield. No other party or Government have attempted to overturn that motion which reflects the wish of the Irish people.  If we are realistic we will admit that it is probable that we will not achieve this aim but we are obliged by that motion which reflects the heartfelt wishes of the public to take every opportunity to state that we are very unhappy and worried about the plant at Sellafield which is on our doorstep.</P>
      <P>We were given plenty of warnings that we were up against a body and an industry who were not going to take heed of what we had to say except, of course, in the event of a major accident when the whole world would turn on them.  At the meeting of the Paris Commission in Cardiff held between 1 to 3 June 1987, motions and recommendations were put forward.  The French delegation entered a reservation on the following recommendation:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Contracting Parties agree not to construct new nuclear reprocessing plants or substantially increase the reprocessing capacity at existing installations <Col N="2229" /> unless following an assessment of the environmental impact, it can be ascertained, that such facilities do not pose a danger of pollution (as defined by Article 1 of the Convention) of the Paris Convention area by radioactive substances either because of their location or by virtue of the technology utilised.  The Commission should be informed of the results of such assessment.</P>
    <P>The French, in other words, did not want to be bound by that recommendation which would bind them to carrying out an environmental impact assessment and leave it up to other juries to decide whether they could continue.</P>
    <P>The French and United Kingdom delegations entered reservations on a further recommendation which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Contracting Parties to the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources declare their firm intention to apply the best available technology in order to minimise and eliminate as soon as possible any pollution caused by radioactive discharges from all nuclear industries, including reprocessing plants, into the marine environment.</P>
    <P>One must wonder why the United Kingdom entered a reservation on this recommendation.  Did they not want to utilise the best available technology in order to minimise and eliminate any pollution caused by radioactive discharges?</P>
    <P>At present one million gallons of water a day are discharged from the existing plant at Sellafield into the Irish Sea.  I am not saying that this water is polluted but rather that that is the quantity of water we are talking about.  There is always a danger that some of this water is polluted. We have to accept that since the mid-eighties, due to pressure which was brought to bear by Ireland and others, the plant at Sellafield have apparently cleaned up their act to a degree. However, I still have my reservations and wonder whether I should believe <Col N="2230" /> that that has been done.  Let me give my reasons.</P>
    <P>As I said, in March 1991 the environment committee of the British-Irish parliamentary body visited Sellafield because it is one of our functions to examine environmental issues as they affect both Britain and Ireland.  The Irish delegation decided that they had to examine the operation at Sellafield where we had many high-powered meetings and I have to say that we were well looked after and impressed in relation to the improvements that have been made with regard to the treatement of waste water and so on, but during the visit there was no mention of the fact that within two months they were going to announce that Sellafield would be the site for a major nuclear dump.  Do you think, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that they forgot to mention this and that it slipped their mind?  In the presence of our British counterparts we expressed the concerns of the Irish people in relation to the existing plant and the new THORP plant but there was not one word about the huge dump that was going to be located there.  I was inclined to believe what we had heard that day but all my confidence was shattered two months later when this announcement was made.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with two or three other issues before I conclude.  As the Minister is aware, since 1987 strict rules have been in place in relation to the obligation to report incidents, no matter how minor.  While I am aware that last night the Minister gave an assurance that he was going to follow the latest incident how can one believe what the management at Sellafield are saying, given that they crash at every hurdle and do not obey the rules?</P>
    <P>Let me quote from an article by Michael Cross which appeared in the <i>Independent</i> on Monday, 22 June and which sounds like the start of a spy thriller or film:</P>
    <P>Alongside a wharf in Yokohama, Japan, lies a ship with no name and no flag.  The 7,000-ton freighter, formerly the British-registered <i>Pacific Crane,</i> is <Col N="2231" /> awaiting a new identity as the latest act of Japan's determination to bring home about 30 tons of its own property from Britain and France.  On a secret date later this year, the freighter will load at Cherbourg and Normandy, then, in company with a specially-built armed escort ship, take a previously undisclosed non-stop route to Japan. American warships, aircrafts and satellites will watch if every mile of the way.</P>
    <P>That ship will not be carrying peanut butter or cucumbers, rather it will be carrying treated material from the new THORP plant at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The question which is a source of concern for me and many other people is what dangers will be posed by these ships, as they pass through the Irish Sea.  Their routes will not be known for security reasons and because they will be carrying plutonium, which can be used to make bombs, there will be an element of secrecy, but what will happen if there is an accident?  Perhaps the answer is secret, too, and we will not even know that an accident occurred until material is washed up on our shores.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by campaigners who are trying to stop these shipments on the grounds that they will pose a threat in maritime waters.  These ships will have to make non-stop voyages of up to 17,000 miles through some of the roughest seas in the world and because of this they will have to carry extra fuel, thereby creating an extra fire hazard. They also claim that an explosion could release 15 times the radioactivity of the Chernobyl disaster.</P>
    <P>I met some of the young children from Chernobyl who visited this country recently following an invitation from some of the scouting organisations and they were not in the best of health.  They had survived and even though it was declared that they had not been badly affected they were pale and listless.  I am glad to say, however, that they had a very good time but they were not like your normal 11, 12 or 13 year old child who is <Col N="2232" /> full of energy and development.  They were suffering from the effects of the disaster at Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>If the campaigners win and stop the shipments of plutonium from the THORP plant what will happen?  The answer is that the waste will have to stay at Sellafield.  I believe, despite the best efforts of and the assurances given by the management at Sellafield, that the countries who send waste for reprocessing will have to take it back, that the Sellafield area will become the dumping ground for everybody in the world because of the costs involved.  It should be said that Japan has met half the cost of the THORP plant.</P>
    <P>There are many things that need to be said but the Minister should not just tell us that he is making every effort, he should highlight the problem at every fora and say we do not like what is happening there or want to see an intensification of development at the Sellafield site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to both Ministers' comments in this debate and I feel there has been a major climbdown by the Government in their attitude towards the British authorities, and British Nuclear Fuels in particular, in relation to Sellafield. I support any moves by the Government to put further pressure on Britain to close Sellafield but there is now a major contrast between the attitude in the Ministers and their attitude when they were in Opposition.  They were demanding the closure of Sellafield but now we are being told that we are powerless, that we have very little say and that legal action against the British Government in the European court would be unsuccessful.  We are being told we must tolerate the rhetoric of the British authorities.  I would support any move the Government take against Britain on his issue but, unfortunately, when one separates the political hype from the political reality, one is left in the position where this country has been badly compromised.  That has happened specifically in relation to Sellafield, because we are depenedent on that plant for the storage and disposal of much of our nuclear waste, admittedly low level <Col N="2233" /> waste.  How can we put real pressure on the British authorities when we are dependent on the same authorities to accept the radioactive waste from many of our health and research institutions?</P>
      <P>When I visited Sellafield in the early eighties, and again in the mid-eighties, we were taken, very diplomatically, to the dumping site adjacent to Sellafield and shown where the Irish nuclear waste is stored.  That was the most telling message of all and it was a great put down for people like myself who were questioning the operation there.  While there we were wined and dined and treated very well because British Nuclear Fuels are operating a multi-billion pound industry reprocessing nuclear waste from all over the world.</P>
      <P>When we talk about taking action, we should get our own act together first.  We do not have a national waste management policy.  As we do not have a policy on how to dispose of our chemical, toxic or nuclear waste how can we, with any credibility, expect other countries to toe the line?  We have no idea of how to deal with the problems of waste disposal. Rather than indulging in the rhetoric of recent years in relation to Sellafield, we should first put our own house in order. We will then be in a position to put pressure on Britain to deal effectively with the problem of waste disposal on the British mainland, especially the problems arising from Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other political hypocrisy is that at a time when Government Ministers were jumping up an down protesting about Sellafield, the then Minister for Finance was putting his name to a multimillion pound loan package to further develop it.  How inconsistent and two-faced can we get?  At one time we were protesting and demanding the closure of Sellafield while, as President of the Council of Finance Ministers, the then Minister for Finance now Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was putting his name to a mulimillion pound package to further develop the plant at Sellafield.  Until such time as we prepare a comprehensive policy to deal with nuclear, toxic and chemical waste we are just indulging in national <Col N="2234" /> hysteria about an issue we cannot effectively deal with.  There was little concern about Sellafield or Windscale in the early eighties when a number of Deputies tried to raise the issue.  That plant in Cumbria was allowed to develop, which increased the threat to this country, without any action being taken.</P>
    <P>Not only have I visited Sellafield on a number of occasions but I have seen the effects of the fallout in the areas around Kiev and the Ukraine following the Chernobyl disaster.  I have seen tragedy in the hospitals in Kiev among the young and not so young victims of the Chernobyl tragedy.  I hope that before anything major happens at Sellafield our Government will get their act together and devise a plan to deal with issues that not only affect the environment but also industrial development and job creation.  We need a national waste policy and general policies to deal with the environment.  Industries setting up here are raising serious questions about our determination in this area.  Instead of participating in the hype the Minister should get down to the real work of developing a policy for our country. We will then be in a position to face the British authorities down in relation to Sellafield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Owen and Allen for sharing their time with me. Democratic Left support the motion.  The demand to close Sellafield has in recent times become something like the &ldquo;third national aim&rdquo; of Irish Governments, especially of Fianna Fáil led Governments. Like the other two national aims, it lends itself simultaneously to political rhetoric and political inactivity.  It is a demand which is safe to make.  As it plays on the well-founded worries of Irish citizens it is politically safe.  It is diplomatically safe because the British authorities believe that the demand is unachievable and that when Irish Ministers demand the closure of Sellafield, they are simply pandering to their national constituency and are not really serious.  As Sellafield is outside the Irish jurisdiction Irish Ministers know they can <Col N="2235" /> demand away and never have to do anything.</P>
      <P>There is a national consensus that Sellafield should be closed.  All shades of political opinion, North and South, share a common concern about Sellafield. Indeed, it is probably the only issue that unifies political opinion on this island.  It is one on which we can all agree.  Up to now there has been little internal debate here about this, the third national aim. The release by Greenpeace a few weeks ago of a copy of an EC Council Directive signed by our Taoiseach has changed all that.  The third national aim has been betrayed by the Government and it is time for ministerial rhetoric to be confronted by treacherous reality.</P>
      <P>In a similar debate in this House on 6 May 1986, the then Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Haughey proclaimed, at column 2862 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>We must take a stand out against the proliferation of nuclear power in whatever form it may take.</P>
      <P>More recently, on 7 March 1990, the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, told a meeting in The Hague:</P>
      <P>The Irish Government believe that the only real solution to the threat presented by Sellafield is the closure of the plant.</P>
      <P>A month later, at the Fianna Fail Ard-Fheis the same Ministers was more typically colourful when he said:</P>
      <P>...Ireland will not take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer on the matter of Sellafield. ...we want Sellafield closed and we will not stop until we see it closed... for good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just two weeks after that Ard-Fheis speech the Irish Government had an opportunity to do something about Sellafield.  Not only did they miss the opportunity but the present Taoiseach presided over a decision of the EC Council of Ministers which extended EC loans to the reprocessing industry, including the Sellafield plant, which apparently we <Col N="2236" /> want closed.  That Council decision of 23 April 1990 said:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,</P>
    <P>Having regard to Council Decision 77/270/Euratom of 29 March 1977 empowering the Commission to issue Euratom loans for the purpose of contributing to the financing of nuclear power stations and in particular Article 1 thereof,</P>
    <P>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</P>
    <P>Whereas the total value of transactions effected has reached the figure of ECU 2,800 million, provided for in Decision 77/271 Euratom, as last amended by Decision 85/537/Euratom;</P>
    <P>Whereas nuclear energy accounts for a major part of the Community's total energy supplies and considerable investment ought to be made in this sector both at the production stage, in view of the safety and security requirements, and downstream of production, particularly with regard to the reprocessing and storage of waste.</P>
    <P>That Council decision of 23 April 1990 goes on to extend the amount of EC loans being made available to the nuclear industry by 1,000 million ECUs.  The significance of that decision was that effectively it enabled the Sellafield 2 plant to be built with the aid of EC loans. Meanwhile, many of us in this House had been pressing the Government to take legal action over Sellafield, as has been mentioned in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy has claimed &mdash; it is reflected in the text of the Government amendment before us this evening &mdash;that we do not have sufficient evidence to sustain a case.  Of course, the real reason is that it has nothing whatever to do with evidence.  How could one Minister of Government take legal action to close Sellafield while another Minister, now the Taoiseach, was effectively signing his name to the cheque which gave EC money to BNFL to extend the plant? The Taoiseach's action at the Council of Ministers has betrayed this country over <Col N="2237" /> Sellafield, has undermined and compromised our ability to take effective, legal, diplomatic or political action to close, or even control the expansion of the Sellafield reprocessing plant.</P>
    <P>Like other Members of this House I tabled questions to the Taoiseach about this matter.  Courageously he transferred those questions to the Minister for Energy who, not unexpectedly, declined the offer to suffer for the sins of the Fianna Fáil Leader.  However, this House and the electorate are owed an explanation as to why, at public fora, the Government demand the closure of Sellafield and while, within the privacy of the EC Council of Ministers, they agree to prolong its life by funding its expansion.  It is not credible for the Government, as they have attempted to do, to claim that these moneys are for nuclear safety.  It is clear from the text of the relevant Council decision that the moneys are intended to support the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>However, more worrying for Ireland is the decision to extend these loan facilities to the reprocessing industry because Sellafield is now the world's, and Europe's, leading reprocessor.  The Taoiseach's signature to that Council decision of 23 April 1990 gives this Government's effective approval to a nuclear reprocessing regime at Sellafield which will increase the radioactivity released into the environment ten times and massively increase discharges.  It will lead to circumstances in which half the world's plutonium stocks will be sited just across the water from us.  The Taoiseach has sold out this country in the matter of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen referred to the motion passed in 1986 as representing the position of this House in relation to Sellafield. Were that motion to be augmented by the Labour Party motion before us this evening, that would be a good development. But we have before us a Government amendment which in the nature of things, given the numerical positions in this House, may end up being adopted here in 25 minutes time.  If that happens, as inevitably it will I believe our last state <Col N="2238" /> will be worse than our first.  In that case this House will have weakened its position in relation to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>In the Government amendment we are being asked to approve the actions taken by the Government in relation to Sellafield. I ask, what actions?  Are these the public declarations made periodically, the protestations made at international fora when Government Ministers know very well they will be ignored, or the actions taken in the apparent privacy of the EC Council of Ministers when, with the usual nod and wink approach, the Government subscribe to a policy that actually supports the nuclear industry?</P>
    <P>We are being asked to note the commitment of the Government to continue their efforts to secure the closure of the Sellafield plant.  I do not believe the Government are committed to securing the closure of the Sellafield plant.  I believe the Government believe that the closure of the Sellafield plant is unattainable. We all talk about the closure of Sellafield but have never actually defined what we mean by the closure of Sellafield. Can we talk honestly about its closure, when there is sited there a nuclear power plant, half the world's stock of plutonium, huge volumes of nuclear waste, already stockpiled?  One cannot simply turn the key on it and walk away from it.</P>
    <P>I believe that British Nuclear Fuels Limited and the United Kingdom authorities are quite happy to continue to hear Irish Ministers and politicians talk glibly about the closure of Sellafield. What would worry them much more &mdash; and this is something on which I contend we should now begin to concentrate our attentions &mdash; would be if we began to talk about halting the expansion of Sellafield, if we began to talk in terms of stopping the THORP plant becoming active. Those are matters about which they would be worried.  Also, they would be far more likely to be effective because there are serious doubts already about the economic viability of the THORP plant.  For example, if the Japanese proceed with the building of a reprocessing plant of their own, the basis on which large volumes of Japanese nuclear waste <Col N="2239" /> will be transferred &mdash; which BNFL have actively sought to support Sellafield &mdash; will undermine the economic viability of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>It is time we stopped using the Sellafield issue as the subject of political rhetoric. It is time that realistic demands were made and in a manner that is realistic.  It is also time that what the Government do within the privacy of European meetings, of diplomatic activity, should conform to their public statements.  On the one hand, the public are being told that the Government have a policy of closing Sellafield and, on the other, circumstances prevail in which our EC partners, in particular the United Kingdom authorities, are being tipped the wink that it is quite all right to proceed with the expansion of Sellafield.  The Government attitude appears to be: we will carry on; tell the people we are all for its closure but we understand that they can proceed with its expansion.  That is not the way to do business.  Government public statements should now be made to conform to private, active political activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first time I have participated in a debate in relation to Sellafield.  One recent parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Energy asked how much of his time had been taken up answering parliamentary questions on Sellafield and related matters.</P>
      <P>The Sellafield issue has occupied much of the time and attention of successive Ministers for Energy.  What I find frustrating and confusing, as a relatively new, young Member of this House, is that we as parliamentarians are somewhat hamstrung by the procedures that are available to us as individuals.  More importantly, the Minister must feel somewhat frustrated because his hands are tied in the context of any action he might take in relation to the genuine, widespread concern of the Irish people about the plant at Sellafield and the proposed development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this is not the first time it has been suggested that we should go to the <Col N="2240" /> European Court or try avenues that we have not yet tried.  The Minister has indicated clearly on numerous occasions that legal opinion is that we would not have a satisfactory case to bring against the British authorities or British Nuclear Fuels Limited in relation to the existing plant.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made in the European Community by the setting up of the inspectorate and one would like to see the Minister taking a very strong clear message from this House to our colleagues in the European Community.  We have proven in the recent past that we want to play a full role in Europe.  We made a positive contribution by way of referendum.  The Minister should indicate our positive attitude on European Union and ask that union to be positive about Ireland's concern in relation to the Sellafield plant and get that inspectorate set up as quickly as possible and also put a procedure in place that we could be somewhat satisfied with to guarantee the safety of the Irish individual <i>vis-à-vis</i> the activity of British Nuclear Fuels Limited and that of the Sellafield development.</P>
    <P>I am led to believe that the fuels coming to and from the THORP plant will travel through the Irish Sea.  I believe contracts have been signed by Germany and Japan.  Germany itself was to develop a reprocessing plant similar to that of THORP but decided, in the national interest, that it would not go ahead with that development and signed a contract with British Nuclear Fuels Limited, as has Japan.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed by the British and Japanese authorities in relation to the transport modes and possible interference with ships travelling to Sellafield with spent fuels.  I am concerned to learn that Japan has indicated that it would be prepared to give the transport carriers the necessary protection by way of warships.  This is quite alarming.  I am not too sure whether or not the Minister can respond to clarify matters of this nature, to say if contracts have been signed by Germany and Japan, to tell us the mode of transport and <Col N="2241" /> whether or not it would be necessary to have the type of protection I mentioned.</P>
    <P>One thing we must recognise is that there can be no national boundaries in the context of the nuclear industry and the fallout from such industry.  We see that in relation to the Chernobyl incident, in the widespread effects not just in the Chernobyl area itself but thousands of miles away.  We are sitting here, with a time bomb only a few miles away, and we are so hamstrung that we can do nothing about it.  Do we have to wait for doomsday before the Minister will be told by his legal advisers that there is a satisfactory case to take aginst the British authorities or against British Nuclear Fuels Limited?  I say that, recognising the good work the Government and the Minister have done.</P>
    <P>Finally I would ask the Minister to go back to his European colleagues and use a lever if necessary.  We have been positive; let them be positive and let them support the Minister in the steps he has indicated to them in the past.</P>

      <P>The Minister and every Deputy in the House would seem to be in complete agreement on the question of the dangers of the Sellafield plant and the whole nuclear industry to the safety and health of all of the people of Ireland and, indeed, of Europe and the world itself.  As well as being a Member of the Dáil, I am a member of two local authorities, Drogheda Corporation and Louth County Council.  These two local authorities and the Dundalk Urban District Authority are, effectively, within walking distance of Sellafield, and this matter has been the subject of many debates, resolutions and motions at all three local authorities in County Louth, for many good reasons apart from the fact that we are the nearest neighbours <Col N="2242" /> of Sellafield.  A number of things have happened in County Louth and in the Border area which have given rise to substantial fear there.  That fear still exists and will continue to exist.  The fear is caused by the close proximity of the plant itself but also by the many surveys and tests that have been carried out in the County Louth area.</P>
      <P>I do not need to remind the House that a number of years ago a very detailed survey was carried out by an eminent doctor in the area which showed a very high level of Down's Syndrome among the children in a class in a particular school who had been born during a period when the level of radioactivity was clearly shown to be abnormally high.  This has never been refuted or proven to be wrong by the British or by any spokesperson on behalf of this or any other Government.  All the indications are that the results of that survey stand to this day as being substantially correct.  If that is correct, what would be the situation if there was a major disaster at Sellafield right on our very doorstep.  For example, when the Russian disaster took place at Cherynobyl, tests were carried out on both sides of the Border in County Down which showed a very substantial increase in the level of radioactivity in the soil in that area.  That has never been contradicted or refuted.  There are many eminent medical people who will also claim that the level of cancer-related illnesses could be caused by the level of radioactivity in the general area of the Border between County Louth and County Down.  Nobody has been able to deny this.  This has given rise to a fear in people's minds, a fear which has never been alleviated.  We have brought over experts from British Nuclear Fuels who have been armed with satchels full of data and expert reports, which they are well capable of paying for &mdash; they spent millions of pounds trying to suppress the facts.  There is a high level of radioactivity on the east coast.  This has been proven by experts who have carried out tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers, I should like to ask what can be done about this problem. Nobody from the Government side has <Col N="2243" /> told us what can be done.  We talk about the need to close the Sellafield plant, but the real problem is who will close it.  The British authorities are not going to close this plant for a number of reasons and there is no way the European Community, which subsidises the continued development of that plant, is going to close it.  I again ask: who will close Sellafield and how can we go about achieving this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will be opposing the amendment in the name of the Government and seeking the support of the House for their motion.  The Irish people have demonstrated their total opposition to nuclear plants for many years.  In 1978-79 the Fianna Fáil Government and the then Minister for Energy, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, proposed building a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point in County Wexford. Approximately 40,000 people protested peacefully against this proposal at one meeting.  Fianna Fáil soon took note of the feelings of the Irish people and abandoned any further ideas of producing energy in nuclear power stations. Only last year local authorities from County Louth to County Wexford joined local authorities from Wales in protesting against the siting of a nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd.  So far that protest seems to have carried a great deal of weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an environmental motion.  I wish to ask why the Minister for Energy defended the Government last night and proposed the amendment.  The Minister for the Environment, or preferably his Minister of State, should have given the lead in this area.  The speech made by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, here tonight was in marked contrast to the speech given by the Minister for Energy, a member of her party, and was far more sympathetic to the views expressed by Members on this side of the House than to the views expressed by Members on the Government side.  This does not surprise me, because when I was Minister <Col N="2244" /> for the Environment some years ago she put forward strong objections to the siting of a waste disposal facility near Baldonnel; indeed, her spirited objections helped to put paid to that proposal.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are unanimous in their opposition to Sellafield.  They are angry at the large extension being built there which will result in the processsing of greater quantities of nuclear waste, thereby hugely increasing the risk to the citizens of this country and of north-west England.  Two recent accidents, in November 1983 and May 1982, caused great concern to people on both sides of the Irish Sea.  We should bear in mind that there is the continuous possibility of an accident occurring in the transportation of nuclear waste to this reprocessing facility, either by land or sea, which will result in atmospheric discharges.  People are concerned about the continuous discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea which will have an accumulated effect on fish and plant life.</P>
    <P>In the very limited time available to me, I have to say that the Minister for Energy refused to answer the questions put by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, when he introduced the motion last night. While agreeing with the concerns expressed in the motion, the Minister for Energy threw up his hands in horror and frustration and declared:</P>
    <P>The Government have always been and continue to be committed to legal action against Sellafield if a sufficient case for it can be shown to exist, but they cannot initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence.  Any such legal action would have to be based on scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland.</P>
    <P>When commenting on the Greenpeace legal opinion he said:</P>
    <P>It is important for me to point out that the Greenpeace presentation related solely to legal procedural possibilities and they failed to put forward any possible case which could be supported by concrete facts or evidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2245" /> The health and safety of the Irish people are the responsibility of the Irish Government. They are not the responsibility of Greenpeace and individuals who are told to come forward with the facts and action will be taken.  I ask the Minister for Energy to look at the <i>Hanrahan v. Merck, Sharp and Dohme</i> case.  The Supreme Court found in favour of Mr. Hanrahan after the High Court had found against him.  They came to the conclusion that the damage caused to Mr. Hanrahan's livestock could only have been caused by a plant which was discharging a dangerous substance into the environment.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister neither defended nor condemned that action taken by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance in 1990.  As president of the ECOFIN Council, the then Minister for Finance was presented with an opportunity to stop the extension at Sellafield: he could have used his veto to stop the loans being made available by the EC to finance the extension at Sellafield.  Could it be that the Minister for Energy is negotiating to buy energy from the British nuclear plants or that the ESB are involved in discussions with British nuclear plants to secure future supplies of energy when our natural energy resources run out?  Perhaps this is the reason the Minister for Energy is reluctant to do more about this problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister some obvious questions which he failed to answer last night.  Surely the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government agree that plutonium is a dangerous and toxic substance? The answer to that question has to be yes.  How can the Radiological Protection Institute claim that plutonium in the food chain and in seaweed off the east coast is safe?  Why does Ireland accept the claims made by BNFL, based on their environmental impact studies, that existing and additional discharges into the Irish Sea are safe?  What reasons do we have to trust these claims?  Why is there no incontrovertible proof that radioactivity in the Irish environment causes cancer, leukaemia <Col N="2246" /> and defects in babies?  It is probable that further research, such as the Gardner and Comare reports, will show a link between certain types of cancer, especially leukaemia, and discharges from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in presenting his case to this House last night failed totally to convince the Irish people of his attempts to close Sellafield.  He is making no great effort to put forward a case for its closure. With the opportunities they have had in the past, this Government have not used their strong position in the European Council to take action against the extension of Sellafield.  Our motion requests urgent action in this case, but that is not evident in the Government's presentation of last night or tonight.  We have heard words of sympathy from backbenchers and words of concern on behalf of their constituents, but no action has been taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 18, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall comprise such and so many colleges as may be determined by the Minister, from time to time, on the recommendation of the Vocational Education Committee or of the Governing Body made following consultation with the Vocational Education Committee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Basically what we propose here is to insert this amendment after &ldquo;The Institute shall be considered from the institutions specified in the First Schedule to this Act.&rdquo;  What we are trying to do is make advance accommodation for future developments and we propose to do so in a number of ways.  First, we recognise the right of the vocational education committee or the governing body to recommend additional colleges for inclusion as colleges constituted under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier today, on Report Stage of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, we tried to enshrine in the Bill the right of vocational education committees to ascertain the needs and the future developments of vocational education.  In <Col N="2248" /> this case we can justify the inclusion of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, which was established in 1930 and gradually brought on stream six colleges &mdash; Kevin Street college, Bolton Street college, Rathmines college, The College of Marketing and Design, Cathal Brugha Street college and the College of Music.  These colleges are at such a stage of development that they are enshrined in this legislation as permanent features of third level education.  We want to see every possible opportunity afforded to these colleges, as has been afforded to universities, so that they can be recognised as having a permanent place in the whole sphere of third level education.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Vocational Education Committee had the foresight to identify niche markets and clear needs in third level education.  They set up these colleges under the aegis of the 1930 Act and no special legislation was introduced as the colleges came on stream and developed their top class third level resources.  What we are proposing now is that the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee be afforded the right to identify future needs within their functional area as these needs arise.  If the vocational education committee &mdash; who will be aware, as they have been in the past, of the needs of the city &mdash; are not afforded this right, it should be afforded to the governing body, which is an amalgam of the various interest groups: the nominated members of the vocational education committee, specialist interest groups elected by the vocational education committee to nominate persons, academic and non-academic staff, the students' union and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  If the governing body identify a need for future development they should have the right to make such a recommendation.  We are trying to be as positive as we can in terms of this amendment and this Bill and we ask the Minister to accept the spirit of what we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>Basically I agree with the amendment as proposed by Deputy Higgins in relation to the way in which the <Col N="2249" /> Dublin Institute of Technology may be extended.  The central point, which is acceptable, relates to leaving the power of recommendation with the vocational education committee or the governing body following consultation with the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology which was set up in 1978, made rapid and considerable progress since then.  The model proposed in this amendment is a sensible and democratic way of dealing with the further expansion of the college at a future date.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>All we are asking the Minister to do is to allow the vocational education committee to continue to make recommendations regarding the establishment of further colleges.  This has been recognised since 1930.  We only have to look around the country to find that they have been excellent at identifying the needs.  To allow the vocational education committees to continue to have that power of recommendation does not impede the aspirations of the Bill, to give autonomy to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It does not interfere with the powers we are giving to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It is merely another layer to identify the needs.  The recommendations they come up with can be judged on their merits.  It would be a pity to isolate the vocational education committees from this role, one they have fulfilled very well to date.  We would gain from them retaining this role.</P>

The third level centre established in Cavan town is now attracting students from all over the country for computer and modern office technique studies.  There is need for a catering course in my region, although not necessarily in County Cavan, for young girls and boys who are anxious to pursue such a career.  There will be none better than the vocational education committee in identifying where such courses should be established.  They should be allowed continue their role because they have a proven track record in the field of education.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputies in paying tribute to the Dublin city and County vocational education committees and the six colleges comprising the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In very difficult circumstances over many years they have given a substantial service.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is superfluous as I have gone further than the Deputies asked me to in my amendment No. 2 which we will be debating next.  The Deputies suggest that the vocational education committee should be consulted before the Minister decides to add a college to the list.  In my amendment No. 2 I not only propose to consult them but have given them a veto.  The Minister, and the vocational education committee, will have to agree before a college is added to the list.  Amendment No. 1 is also superfluous because section 3 (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Institute shall be constituted from the Institution specified in the First Schedule....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The First Schedule lists the institutions involved.  Section 3 (3) provides that the Minister and the vocational education committee can amend the First Schedule if they so wish.  Section 3 (3) permits the Minister, and the vocational education <Col N="2251" /> committee, if they both agree to add to the First Schedule at any time.  That in effect fully takes care of what the Deputies are trying to do in amendment No. 1.  It goes substantially further because it means that the Minister, and the vocational education committee, must agree.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to change &ldquo;or&rdquo; to &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  I agreed to the amendment when I met the IVEA yesterday.  It does not change the principle of the Bill but the IVEA felt it was important.  I had no difficulty in agreeing to this because the Bill deals with the Dublin Institute of Technology and its constitutent colleges. I was not aiming to target it at future colleges or whatever else might come in under the legislation.  That should be the subject of other legislation.  I accepted that this change was very important to them and I had no difficulty in agreeing to it.  I think this shows my willingness to accommodate the IVEA's views to the greatest extent possible.  By acceding to their wish, it means that the schedule of the six colleges cannot be added to unless the Minister and the vocational education committee jointly agree to extending it. From my point of view, that does not change the principle of the Bill but it is a reasonable compromise.</P>

However, under the section as amended, both have to agree jointly to the proposal and even with their joint agreement the section states:</P>
      <P>the Minister may, by order, made with the consent of the Minister for finance, following consultation with the Vocational Education Committee and the Government Body, amend the said First Schedule by inserting therein the name of the institution or a description of the part thereof to be incorporated....</P>
      <P>So that even if the Minister and the vocational education committee agree that any other institution should be incorporated into the institute there is no guarantee that it will happen.  It will be a very difficult process to have any other educational institute incorporated into the Dublin Institute of Technology.  First, there has to be agreement between the Minister and the vocational education committee; then the Minister has to get the consent of the Minister for Finance and then he has to consult again with the vocational education committee and the governing body to order to amend the First Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister not agree to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in page 4, line 22, of section 3 (3) so that the Minister has the power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to incorporate an educational institution into the Dublin Institute of Technology?  This would cut out some of the clap-trap of the section. It should be a relatively simple procedure to incorporate another educational institution into the Dublin Institute of Technology, particularly if the Minister agrees, as that means the Department agree to it and if the vocational education committee agree, that means that everybody involved in the process agrees to the incorporation of another institution.  I believe this should happen if the Minister for Finance then consents to it without <Col N="2253" /> having to go through the whole process of getting the consent of the vocational education committee, the Minister, or the governing body.</P>

      <P>On re-reading section 3 (3) I concur with some of the points made by Deputy Mac Giolla.  The subsection as amended by ministerial amendment No. 2 will read:</P>
      <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister and the Vocational Education Committee considers....</P>
      <P>I wonder what exactly the word &ldquo;considers&rdquo; means.  I feel the term is somewhat inappropriate because it merely means that they are of that opinion but it does not refer to how the opinion is arrived at or how the vocational education committee communicate their opinion to the Minister and the form in which it must be communicated to the Minister.  Further down the subsection, line 21 reads, &ldquo;the Minister may, by order, made with the consent of the Minister for Finance,&rdquo; and here we see the dead hand of the Minister for Finance. The Minister then has to engage in further consultation with the vocational education committee and the governing body.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I raised the exact status a new institution or part of an institution would have if included in the First Schedule and the words now used in subsection (3) state &ldquo;by inserting therein the name of the institution or a description of the part thereof to be incorporated&rdquo;. I agree that the subsection is cumbersome.  Obviously the Minister has responded to a request from the IVEA and I compliment him on his openness to change and his willingness to go some way to meet the fears expressed by the IVEA on the role of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The language is very heavy and the concept is convoluted.  I wonder do we really need such a wordy subsection instead of a simple statement to deal with the important function of extending the Dublin Institute of Technology at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fine spread of colleges comprising <Col N="2254" /> the institute, but as technology and other disciplines develop, it may become necessary for colleges that now exist outside the system to be incorporated into the Dublin Institute of Technology. I believe the formula to be followed in this case should be relatively simple.  Naturally the process of consultation should take time but the duplication of consultation with the vocational education committee in particular and with the vocational education committee and governing body does not strengthen the position of the vocational education committee or the governing body which would be consulted for the first time at the second stage.  However, I am open to being enlightened.  I find the rationale behind this difficult to follow and the whole thing is somewhat confusing.</P>

      <P>This amendment does not enhance the role of the vocational education committee.  In fact, it is tying them to the Minister.  In other words, there has to be a unanimous agreement before any other educational institution can be incorporated into the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I think it takes away the liberty, freedom or independence that the vocational education committee had in the first place to make such a recommendation.  As Deputy O'Shea said, the subsection is cumbersome. I just do not understand it but I am anxious to hear the Minister's explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say that we were responsible for inserting &ldquo;or&rdquo; into the Bill on Committee Stage, &mdash; a pre-emptive strike.  We did so to break the link between the Minister and the <Col N="2255" /> vocational education committee in order to deliberately make it an either/or situation and to get away from a situation where the vocational education committee were tied hand and foot to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Without joint agreement a proposal cannot even get out of the starting blocks to reach the further complicated section, the labyrinth that Deputy Mac Giolla spoke about.  The process of initiating a new college of technology, a new third level institution, is not started unless the joint agreement of the Minister and the vocational education committee is obtained.  If the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee identify a clear new need for a third level college their proposal first goes to the Minister.  If the Minister does not agree to the proposal the process stops there. By inserting the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; we wanted to provide that the process could be taken at least a stage further.  It would not get a great deal further anyway, because further down the road the agreement of two Ministers would be required.  If the Minister accepted our argument, the debate could commence.  As the provision stands, a proposal will not get past stage one unless the Minister agrees with the vocational education committee. That was the basic reason for our amendment on Committee Stage to insert the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's comments earlier in refusing to take on board our broadening of what could be achieved as provided in amendment No. 1.  I do not agree with the Minister that the role of the vocational education committee is strengthened and I really do not know what was going through the minds of the IVEA when they gave approval to the Minister yesterday to introduce that measure.</P>

      <P>It is hard to win. Last evening the IVEA told me that this provision was fundamental and it was their major reason for coming to see me. They said that the issue was fundamental <Col N="2256" /> because so long as the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was included the Minister of the day would be able to unilaterally, without the agreement of the vocational education committee, designate a college to be added to the list.  The Minister would not even have to talk to the vocational education committee.  Come hell or high water, the IVEA wanted that power to be taken from the Minister.  After listening to them at some length, I said that if the issue was so fundamental to them the power would be shared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that this morning in the debate on the Regional Technical Colleges Bill Deputies seemed satisfied enough with the provision.  In fact, one Deputy &mdash; who shall remain nameless &mdash; thanked me for substituting the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; because a proposal would thus require the agreement of both the Minister and the vocational education committee. Therein lies some inconsistency.</P>
      <P>I was quite happy with the provision containing the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; because it allowed the Minister to move unilaterally but I have now given a public undertaking to the IVEA &mdash; which I shall stand over &mdash; that the agreement of both the Minister and the vocational education committee will be required.  One or two Deputies said it would be cumbersome but it does not have to be so.  All day long Deputies have argued trenchantly and very competently that the vocational education committee should have a role.  The decision of the vocational education committee and that of the Minister should not take too long.  The addition to the Dublin Institute of Technology of a new college is an important step and one that arguably should be somewhat cumbersome, not just a stroke of a pen by a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of a new institution will now be made on the agreement of both the Minister and the vocational education committee and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Even if that clause were not included in the Bill and any <Col N="2257" /> expenditure was involved, the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance would have to give sanction or the decision would be meaningless.  Usually the addition of a college would not increase costs and therefore in general there would not be a difficulty obtaining the sanction of the Minister for Finance. That provision is very much <i>pro forma</i> and something that can take place very quickly.</P>
    <P>I consider that the balance is right. The vocational education committee are being given a veto in the same way as the Minister has a veto.  If for very good reasons the Minister is not satisfied with a proposal he can stop the process and if for good reasons the vocational education committee are not satisfied they can stop the process.  In this case both are legitimate interests.  The substitution of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; gives more scope to the vocational education committee than they had heretofore, in that the insertion of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; meant that the Minister could ride roughshod over the vocational education committee by making unilateral decisions.  The vocational education committee now have the right of veto, which surely is progress from the point of view of the vocational education committee.  The IVEA said that the change was fundamental, so I am somewhat at a loss to see a reason for the change in attitude expressed by some Deputies.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 3, after &ldquo;training&rdquo; to insert&rdquo;, including apprenticeship education,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to amend section 5 (1), which provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal function of the Institute shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be to provide vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, <Col N="2258" /> commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State.</P>
    <P>An examination of the profile of the six Dublin colleges shows clearly that apprenticeships constitute a very large factor.  There are more than 5,000 apprentices in the Dublin colleges at present and they are recognised as being a very valuable component.  According to the 1968 Industrial Grants Act, vocational education committees clearly have responsibility for apprenticeships. We therefore feel that it is absolutely vital that the term&rdquo;, including apprenticeship education&rdquo; be inserted.</P>
    <P>For some reason or another in the past we have got used to diluting the word &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; down to more modern terminology such as &ldquo;technical education and training&rdquo;.  However, an apprenticeship is a particular kind of education in its own right.  It is a kind of education that has served this country exceedingly well.  It is also a very important component in the Dublin city colleges of technology. Apprenticeship education should therefore be specifically written into the Bill.  On Committee Stage no good reason was advanced for not including apprenticeship training.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, in the general spirit of openness, goodwill and good faith in which amendments are being advanced and the Minister's receptiveness of what he feels to be genuine amendments, to recognise the merits of including apprenticeship training in this provision.  Whatever the case in relation to the regional technical colleges, there is a cast iron case in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  There are 5,000 apprentices &mdash; a considerable number &mdash; in the colleges at present, and it is obvious that they will remain a valuable part of the developing Dublin Institute of Technology, indeed, it is hoped that they will be an expanding part of the institute. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was adequately discussed on Committee Stage, so I shall not detain the House <Col N="2259" /> other than to say that I fully agree with the comments made by Deputy Higgins. On Committee Stage the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, said he would reconsider this aspect in order to determine whether this amendment or something like it could be incorporated in the Bill on Report Stage.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate on this Bill and the Regional Technical Colleges Bill I spoke very strongly on the issue of apprenticeship training.  I agree entirely with everything that Deputy Higgins has said, particularly on the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I pointed out that the word &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; did not appear in either Bill and that I was worried as to which road was being taken in relation to apprenticeships. That matter has worried many people in the education field in the past 12 months.  Concern has been expressed as to whether the Department of Labour were taking over all apprenticeships from the Department of Education.  It is still in the melting pot, although the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, in spite of the huge level of apprenticeship in the Dublin Institute of Technology, did not have and were not asked to have consultations on the establishment of the national apprenticeship committee and had no representative on it.  They are the major apprenticeship institute in the country with 5,000 apprentices.  The absence of the word &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; from this Bill was not just obvious, it was further adding to the perception that apprenticeship was being moved out of the educational field into FÁS as a sort of skills training programme rather than an educational programme for life.  That worries me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on Committee Stage the Minister of State assured us that that section to provide vocational technical education includes apprenticeship.  If that is the case &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will agree it is his intention and it includes apprenticeship training &mdash; he will not <Col N="2260" /> object to inserting the words &ldquo;including apprenticeship training&rdquo;.  It would give some assurance to many people and some stability to the whole apprenticeship scheme to know it is recognised as a major part of the institution of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Apprenticeship training given in the Dublin Institute of Technology does not end with just training a bricklayer to put one brick on top of another; it trains and educates craftspeople and gives them the opportunity for further educational development, if they wish to avail of it, to certificate or diploma level.  One or two have gone on to degree level.  They learn the whole process of education as well as learning apprenticeship skills and training.  Some academics probably would prefer that this whole apprenticeship matter be pushed away some place else to give them a more academic image, but it was, is and should continue to be a vital part of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the people who put down this amendment I too want to press it very strongly with the Minister. The very point which has given rise to this amendment is fundamental to the whole operation in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  As other Deputies have said, there are 5,000 apprenticeships or other craft technician students attending the colleges.  That is well in excess of 20 per cent of the total enrolment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be thinking abroad now that apprenticeships should be curtailed in length and that training should take place over a much shorter period. Obviously, training is central to any apprenticeship, but exposing students to a liberal syllabus as part of their apprenticeship education &mdash; I ask the Minister to note that &ldquo;education&rdquo; is the word used in the amendment as distinct from &ldquo;training&rdquo;&mdash; is most important.  Education is about the development of the individual to the full potential of his or her ability. I put it strongly to the Minister that to concentrate solely on training, or training to the virtual exclusion of an educational input, is not in the interests of apprenticeship students.  It is very important that <Col N="2261" /> this very important function of the Dublin Institute of Technology, which has a bearing on more than 20 per cent of the students attending in the colleges, should be very clearly and unequivocally stated in the functions of the college.</P>
    <P>My recollection, like that of Deputy Mac Giolla, is that it was the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, who indicated on Committee Stage that training would include apprenticeship.  I take it that undertaking was given in good faith, but I put it to the Minister that we are dealing here with legislation.  We are in the process of making law and law will be interpreated to mean what it states.  There is a very definite problem here.  If we do not define clearly that training includes apprenticeship education, at some future time, in spite of what is said in the House in debate, the legal interpretation could be that training would not include apprenticeship education.</P>
    <P>The point has been made regarding the direction that apprenticeship may very well be taking.  There is a strong school of thought out there that to shorten the period of training for apprenticeships is a good thing because we will have trained people much more quickly.  There may be merit to that argument in terms of providing people to carry out tasks in industry, be it construction, industrial manufacture of whatever, but that is not education in its real sense.  In the context of the Green Paper and of education in general it is people and their full development we should concern ourselves with.</P>
    <P>Therefore, accepting this amendment is more than just a cosmetic exercise.  It is an important safeguard that can be put into this Bill.  This will be our last opportunity in the Dáil to provide in law that the training function of the Dublin Institute of Technology includes apprenticeship education.  The Minister may feel that because the whole area of apprenticeship is being examined, it may be premature to insert such a provision.  It is incumbent on this Oireachtas to protect this very vital part of the Dublin Institute of Technology's function which covers such a large number of students.  Therefore, <Col N="2262" /> I ask the Minister to look earnestly and sympathetically at this amendment and agree to its inclusion in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the arrival of the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, indicates that he has come to reiterate the commitment he gave us on Committee Stage that this amendment would be considered seriously and perhaps will be accepted here in his presence.  It is asking to have inserted in the Bill what is already happening in the Dublin Institute of Technology, over 5,000 apprenticeships being provided for.  The apprentices who emerge are of the highest quality and continually succeed not only in getting prizes and awards nationally but also internationally.  This is something of which we should rightly be proud and certainly the qualities and standards achieved merit recognition of the fact that apprenticeships are provided for within the Dublin Institute of Technology. Of course standards are even further enhanced by the fact that there has been an expansion into apprenticeship education whereby students take language courses, which are so important when many emerging apprentices may have to go abroad to find employment. Excellent as their skills may be, the real bonus with such skills is to have proficiency in a foreign language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider accepting this amendment because we must enhance what the Dublin Institute of Technology are doing already in the apprenticeship area.  Apart from that, unfortunately the apprenticeship scheme is in a state of confusion, to such an extent that very few employers take on apprentices because they are told that the scheme will change.  There is also the added burden of the costs to employers in having apprentices and, even worse, those outside the Dublin Institute of Technology find it very difficult to get a sponsor.  I have always believed that it is very unfair that a student's only hope of getting an apprenticeship is who he knows or the contacts he or she may have. That does not come within the bounds of what we believe we provide within <Col N="2263" /> education &mdash; equality of opportunity for all.  The apprenticeship scheme at present is in conflict with what we want for all our students &mdash; equality of opportunity. In recognition of what is being decided in the Dublin Institute of Technology, it would be a step in the right direction to accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully endorse, accept and pay tribute to the very strong tradition of apprenticeship, particularly in Kevin Street and Bolton Street, who have had such a great commitment to that tradition over such a long period.  I also endorse the content of what has been said by Deputies, but I am not able to include the phrase in this section.  The commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, has been full delivered because we have looked at this matter very seriously from a number of aspects and considered how we might oblige by putting in the phrase &ldquo;including apprenticeship training&rdquo;.  It is purely for technical reasons that I prefer not to include it, because section 5 (1) specifically states that the principal function of the institute shall be to provide vocational and technical education and training.  I must repeat what the Minister of State said, we are quite satisfied that it includes apprenticeship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I have difficulty in using the phrase is that there is a major review and ongoing debate about apprenticeship and a commitment in the Green Paper to look at how we might broaden the definition of &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo;.  We must consider where the post leaving certificate courses will fit into this structure. It may be an objective, for example, to have in time national certification for all technical education and training, which would include apprenticeship.  I am happy that technical education and training is referred to in the Bill.  The other reason for not accepting the amendment is because of the review of apprenticeship, where it fits into our system and the debate which the Green Paper will <Col N="2264" /> generate in that area.  In those circumstances it would be unwise to specifically spell it out in this section.  As I said, I have a technical objection to including the phrase in the Bill.  As a result of the review the definition may be broadened and that phrase might be subsumed in another way with national certification, education or technical training.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to remove ministerial control.  The inclusion of the provision was raised on Committee Stage and I undertook then to introduce the amendment which seeks to remove any ministerial authority in regard to deciding on courses.  It is consistent with my determination to remove the Minister from the legislation as much as possible.  It is also consistent with the Regional Technical College Bill which was dealt with earlier.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 10, after &ldquo;give&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;degrees,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a case of the old chestnut that will not go away.  The Minister has still not enshrifed the right of the institutes to award degrees.  Deputy Mac Giolla highlighted the problem when he said that students pursue courses in the colleges of technology in Bolton Street or Kevin Street, the College of Commerce, Rathmines; the College of Music, Chatham Row, the Dublin College of Catering, Cathal Brugha Street, or the College of Marketing and Design Mountjoy Square and yet the degree is awarded by another institution.  Students when asked which college they attended will, for example, say the College of Technology, Bolton Street and if asked from which college they received their degree will say, Trinity College.  That simply does not add up.  If the quality of education being imparted is of a sufficient standard to be recognised and receive the imprimatur of the University of Dublin &mdash; we should go all the way at this stage and give the institute the power to award degrees in their own right.  The Minister may say that he has inserted provisos in the Bill and that he gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to empower the institute to award degrees after one year. The Minister, having considered the matter in the interim, should with effect from the enactment of this legislation, which will pass through the Dáil tonight and the Seanad next week, empower the Dublin colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology to award degrees in their own right.  The colleges have acknowledged and are grateful for the very valuable liaison and link they have had with Trinity College.  Trinity College has provided an invaluable interaction with them and validated their courses. That has added further to the argument for empowering the colleges to award <Col N="2269" /> degrees in their own right with effect from the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that this power be effective from tonight. On Committee Stage we went part of the way towards doing this and the Minister gave a commitment to consider conferring this right on the colleges in one year's time.  If that can be done in one year's time why can it not be done now? When I spoke on a similar amendment on Committee Stage I asked the Minister why the degree being conferred at present by the DIT, in conjunction with Trinity College, could not be conferred by the colleges?  We have to respect the aspiration of the colleges to have the status of granting their own degrees yet, as my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, said, we must recognise, welcome and appreciate the co-operation the colleges received from Trinity College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, on Committee Stage, pointed out that a certain amount of time was needed to examine the courses to see if they were worthy of degree status.  That proposal may have a certain amount of merit.  Again we must point out that the courses awarded degrees at present by Trinity College and provided in the Dublin Institute of Technology surely do not need to be re-examined or reevaluated in order to ascertain whether they are worthy of being allocated degree status?  That has been done already.  I believe the colleges would be satisfied if from the passage of this Bill at least those degrees could be awarded by the colleges themselves.  Perhaps the Minister needs another year to re-examine the other courses.  Having come so close to meeting us on this amendment it is a pity the Minister cannot advance just a few more months and grant this status to colleges who have worked so hard to deserve the honour of being able to grant their own degrees.  It is my belief that the matter of re-evaluating the courses to establish whether they should carry degree status will be a matter of course only, that we will find they are worthy of that status.  As I asked the Minister on Committee Stage, why not allow these <Col N="2270" /> colleges to award degrees, in particular the degrees at present being awarded by Trinity College?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 5 in the names of Deputies J. Higgins and T. Ahearn.  However, I contend that amendment No. 6, in my name and that of Deputy O'Shea, is slightly better in so far as it proposes the addition of the term &ldquo;degrees (graduate and post-graduate),&rdquo;. It is important that those words be added because they will clarify the issue.  When replying perhaps Deputy Jim Higgins would say whether he would prefer his or mine.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7, which seeks to insert after &ldquo;awards&rdquo; the words &ldquo;including post-graduate degrees and honorary awards and to appoint external assessors and examiners as the governing body may deem appropriate&rdquo;, is a very important one.  Perhaps it is a pity it is being subsumed into the other two amendments, because in some ways it is slightly different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine the Dublin Institute of Technology, which has 7,700 wholetime third level students, 10,000 part-time students and 5,000 apprentices and is the second largest third level educational institute in the State.  For that reason it is most important.  The Dublin Institute of Technology provides under-graduate level education to the highest international standards as assessed by an external monitoring and examination process supervised by the academic council. The institute provides tuition and external examination on behalf of many professional bodies, including the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Institute of Food, Science and Technology, the Institute of Mathematics and the Institute of Statisticians. The external examination and qualification of these professional bodies is of honours primary degree standard.  Furthermore, the Dublin Institute of Technology provides supervision of post-graduate research leading to the award of master degrees and doctorates.  The institute is structured in a manner similar to technological universities and <Col N="2271" /> institutes located on the Continent, in that technological education is available from apprenticeship training to post-graduate degree level in a single institution. Finally, the Bill introduces an artificial bar to the development of the institute as a third level educational institute by restricting the level of awards which could be granted through diplomas and certificates.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 seeks to delete the phrase &ldquo;excluding degrees other than degrees provided for by order under subsection (2) (a)&rdquo;.  Section 5 (4) of the Bill, as initiated, would appear to preclude the institute from holding land because land would be vested in the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  There is an obvious potential conflict between the two bodies which would need to be examined.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support amendment No. 6, in my name and that of Deputy Garland, which seeks to insert after &ldquo;awards&rdquo; in section 5 (1) (b) the words &ldquo;degrees (graduate and post-graduate)&rdquo;. What academic institutions need more than anything else in order to prosper and develop in academic freedom. The kernel of academic freedom is power to confer or grant diplomas, certificates or educational awards and &mdash; probably most important in terms of public perception &mdash; to award degrees and post-graduate qualifications.  This is something in respect of which the Minister has made very little progress.</P>
      <P>It is conceded that on Committee Stage the Minister introduced section 5 (2) (a), which reads:</P>
      <P>The Institute shall have such other functions, which may include the function of conferring degrees, post-graduate degrees and honorary awards as may be assigned to it, from time to time, by order made by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word on which we should concentrate there is &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The Minister <Col N="2272" /> indicated his hope of degree conferring becoming one of the functions of the Dublin Institute of Technology within one year.  In the context of the year that is in it I would suggest that is a highly ambitious goal in that the Green Paper on Education has just been published.  I understood from comments the Minister made in the House last week that he envisaged a six month debate on the Green Paper, which will be followed by a White Paper.  I am uncertain about the timescale for a debate on this; I am not sure what the Minister has in mind.  Then the Bill will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas and be enacted.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of matters in respect of which the Minister could help us in regard to our reaction to section 5 (2) (a).  The first is: what is the establishment date he has in mind for this Bill?  For example, what will be the date on which he will announce the final phase of giving the Dublin Institute of Technology its full official function?  Will the year about which he spoke in the House last week be a year from the enactment of the Bill, or will it be a year from the establishment date?</P>
    <P>A more important point has been raised by me in the course of the debate on both these Bills in the House.  I dealt to some extent earlier this evening with apprenticeships.  As this Bill stands, I have a strong feeling that the apprenticeship provision could well go into decline in terms of numbers in the not too distant future.  Following the letter issued to regional technical colleges in regard to the curtailment of the degree provision within those colleges, it is reasonable to assume that a similar thought process exists regarding the degree provision in the Dublin Institute of Technology, which at present has about 30 per cent of students as against 10 per cent in the regional technical college sector.  There are demographic trends in relation to the intake of national schools which have been in place for some years. There is incontrovertible evidence that the net effect will be that there will be fewer students available for third level <Col N="2273" /> education in the years to come.  It would seem from Government policy that the favoured area for maintaining present provision is that of the universities.  I am fearful about the provisions in the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill regarding degrees.  The Minister has gone some way down the road to alleviate the fears Deputies stated on Committee Stage, but this is not a mandatory section.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is included and this gives great discretion to the Minister on the question of the conferring of degrees by Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>I made a point earlier today in relation to the Regional Colleges Bill which is equally relevant to this Bill.  It refers to the portion of the Green Paper on Education which states:</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the new legislation for regional technical college/DIT is the provision to permit them to engage in research and development work with industry.  Such research would be mainly applied research with a regional dimension and in the areas of the synthesis and dessemination of existing knowledge.  It is envisaged that basic research would still be conducted largely by the universities.</P>
    <P>Whereas the Minister can respond by telling us that the Green Paper is a discussion document, I believe that in the context of the letter that was sent to the chief executive officers of the vocational education committees on 14 May in relation to the regional technical colleges, that section is indicative of the direction that the Department see third level education taking.  It is clearly stated in the Green Paper that it is the intention of the Department that the regional technical college/DIT sector will have a subsidiary role in relation to research and development work.  Therefore the provision for students to pursue degree courses at the Dublin Institute of Technology is restricted.</P>
    <P>This section relates to academic freedom in the first instance, but here the Department are reaching a position where they can copperfasten their grip <Col N="2274" /> on the Dublin Institute of Technology sector and prevent it from expanding as Deputies on this side of the House would wish it to do.  The emphasis will be more and more on certificate and diploma courses, which of course are vitally important, but the whole range of qualifications presently available in the Dublin Institute of Technology should not alone be maintained but allowed to expand uninhibited in the future.  There are many pointers that this is not the intention of the Department of Education.  It is absolutely vital that these amendments be made so that the future of the Dublin Institute of Technology in the context of the conferring of degrees is ensured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the crucial section of the Bill.  This is the section which will decide whether the Dublin Institute of Technology will be a Mickey Mouse institute or an institute that can stand alone and gain international renown.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the Green Paper and during the discussion on these Bills, said that in order to give power to governing bodies he must withdraw power both from the Minister and from the vocational education committees.  What power do they have when they cannot confer degrees?  In recent years the Dublin Institute of Technology has had well over 500 graduates in each year and these graduates gain their degrees from Trinity College.  Since the Dublin Institute of Technology was established they have turned out over 10,000 graduates, but are they graduates of the Dublin Institute of Technology or of Trinity?  It is outrageous to suggest that the Minister should have a year or two to see if the courses are worthy of degree status after the institute have turned 10,000 graduates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section, specifically excluding degrees, is quite demeaning to the institute.  It is a very negative section. This is what will be passed into law if the Minister leaves it at that.  We will have an institute which will grant certificates and diplomas but not degrees, other than whatever the Minister may provide for in <Col N="2275" /> future.  As in the case of apprenticeships, it is all very well for the Minister to say that he will review the matter in a year's time, but it is not in the Bill.  If the Minister intends to do this in a year's time, could he not bring forward an amendment to cover that now or when the Bill goes to the Seanad?  I take it that the year is the first year in which the governing body is established, which, according to this Bill, is after the expiration of the term of office of the first ordinary members.  Could the Minister not bring in an amendment to provide that degrees may be awarded from the establishment of the first new governing body?  Otherwise there is nothing in the Bill except the negative provision that the Dublin Institute of Technology cannot confer degrees.  The fact that the Minister may include the function of conferring degrees at some future date with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance &mdash; again the shadow in the background &mdash; does not mean it will happen.  Once this Bill is passed the institute will be as established. The work we put into discussing these provisions on Committee Stage and now on Report Stage will be all to no avail.  This Bill is even more negative than the current position in the Dublin Institute of Technology because it is written into this that they are excluded from conferring degrees.  It is a very bad attitude for the Minister to have to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  He is conferring powers on boards of management and governing bodies and this power is taken from both the Minister and the vocational education committees. Then the Minister takes the real power from them &mdash; they have not the power to confer a degree.  They are waiting for the Minister to decide when that power will be given to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister must make a definite statement in the Bill.  If he feels, for some reason that I cannot understand, that it cannot be done now but that it can be done in a year's time, that presumably being the year beginning when the new governing body is properly elected and established, I would appeal to him to <Col N="2276" /> include a specific provision in the Bill which states that once the new governing body are established they will have the right to confer degrees.  After all these years I do not think any further examination of the courses run by these colleges is required.  It is vitally important that such a provision is included in the Bill.  The Minister stated that he intends to do this in a year's time.  The Minister may not be in office in a year's time, and it is the person in office who will have to make this decision.  I ask him to include a specific provision in the Bill setting out when the Dublin Institute of Technology can confer degrees.</P>

      <P>We have to cover a fairly long road in the remaining 20 minutes.  I call Deputy Flaherty. Without wanting to be accused of the inevitable pun, I might say there is a degree of repetition to date.  Maybe we could pull things together for the last round-up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as most of the substantial points have already been made.  There is widespread consensus on this issue.  This is indicated by the level of interest in it.  This is a matter on which I received the most substantial representations. I was a member of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee for six years.  The Dublin Institute of Technology were being developed under the aegis of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee at that time.  Like Deputy Mac Giolla, who was also a member of that committee, I understand the importance of this issue to the institutes involved.  These institutes have earned the right to confer degrees. They have an outstanding reputation and have achieved the academic standards required to enable them to grant degrees at the highest level.  Some of the courses run by the Dublin Institute of Technology are acknowledged to be the best available. Indeed, some of their courses are more sought after than the degree courses run by other institutes; they are regarded as the leaders in their field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology <Col N="2277" /> had a slow and laborious birth.  For example, they had to deal with the disappointment of losing the Glasnevin campus, which was used for another development in the education field.  As it happened, this development turned out to be very valuable.  We are finally giving the Dublin Institute of Technology their independence, albeit with very strong links with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, who have nurtured them so well.  While I should like these links to be maintained in many areas, it is vital that the Dublin Institute of Technology are given the right to confer degrees, a right which they have earned.  Like other speakers, I believe there is a lack of acknowledgement of the outstanding academic results achieved by the Dublin Institute of Technology to date.  It is vital that their success is recognised if they are to develop as an independent institute.  I plead with the Minister even at this late stage to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is widespread agreement among Members on this side of the House that the Minister should accept this amendment.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the international recognition given to the Bolton Street College of Technology.  I have visited different parts of the world and met people who attended that college.  They have been unstinting in their praise of the standards of the courses being provided by that college.  The same can be said about the Kevin Street College of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a glorious opportunity to make a real input to the Bill by accepting this amendment.  If he does not accept the amendment this legislation will lose its direction.  Acceptance of this amendment by the Minister will change the status of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to take his courage in his hands in this instance.  Section 5 (2) (a) provides that the Minister may grant degree awarding status to the Dublin Institute of Technology by order.  I should like to point out to the Minister that regulations still <Col N="2278" /> have to be made under the Civil Liability Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, Ministers are asked every morning on the Order of Business when regulations under various Acts will be made. The granting of degree awarding status to the Dublin Institute of Technology is of great importance to the students attending the Bolton Street and Kevin Street Colleges of Technology, the College of Music and the Dublin College of Catering, Cathal Brugha Street.  The courses run by the catering college are excellent.  Even though this college is internationally recognised I believe employers will hire people with degrees from other institutes before employing people with diplomas from this college.  I plead with the Minister to give the Dublin Institute of Technology degree awarding status.</P>
    <P>This is the key issue in the Bill.  The words &ldquo;excluding degrees&rdquo; should not be included in the Bill and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  This would not only be an important gesture on the part of the Minister but would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, courage is a subjective quality.  There is absolutely no doubt that the Dublin Institute of Technology should be given degree awarding status.  I said that on Committee Stage and that is my intention.  As I said on Committee Stage, we need to do one or two things before we take that final step. I have no doubt that the quality is there to permit that to happen.  We are undertaking a major re-organisation.  We are putting in place an historic institute integrating six colleges into a single structure. The necessary bodies need to be put in place, particularly the new governing body and the academic council.  The reason I have targeted 12 months for the awarding of degrees is that the Department need to discuss a range of matters with the interim board, in particular.  We need to discuss the logistics of putting in place the formal new governing body and in regard to degrees we need to discuss <Col N="2279" /> arrangements for external examiners and other quality control procedures which are already tried and tested in the colleges.  It is important that we are able to agree with the interim governing body on how to proceed.  It is out of courtesy to the interim governing body and the need to discuss with them how to put the final structure in place that we suggested the delay in awarding degrees for a targeted period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>It is set down in the Bill that the Minister can do that by order.  In response to Opposition requests on Committee Stage I agreed to introduce post-graduate degrees and honorary awards at the same time as introducing the degree awarding status.  There is no reluctance on my part to award the degree status.  This will be done as quickly as possible.  It is something that should be done by the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Together with a whole range of technical matters it will be discussed by the Department and the interim governing body.  The principle is established and degrees will be awarded as soon as possible.  About 30 per cent of the present graduates are being validated by the Trinity College degree, but obviously the colleges should be able to award their own degrees as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea asked about the establishment date.  I see no reason for delay in this matter.  Once the President has signed the Bill I propose to sign the necessary orders to bring it into effect.  I would not like to delay beyond 1 September but I have to put a <i>caveat</i> on that because I must check the technicalities of the matter before I formally commit myself to that date.  I intend to have the legislation implemented quickly, certainly before 1 September, if that is possible.  I will have to see whether there are any procedural matters to be dealt with before I sign the order, but as of now I do not think there are any major obstacles. When the legislation is put into effect we will be able to set up the interim board and then move to setting up the full governing body at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla made the point that <Col N="2280" /> the institute should stand alone and be an autonomous body.  That is what I have been saying all day in relation to regional technical colleges.  I am glad the Deputy believes in the principle of autonomy. The whole philosophy of this legislation is to give autonomy.  That is why the Deputy and I have had many differences during the day about the role of the vocational education committee.  You cannot have it both ways; you cannot say that the colleges must have autonomy while also saying that the vocational education committees must have the real power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we want to give autonomy to the colleges, the present incumbents &mdash; the vocational education committees &mdash; must lose some autonomy. I see no way out of that, but I am glad the Deputy is requesting autonomy.  I cannot agree with the Deputy's comment that if the colleges get the degree awarding power now they will be a major national institution, whereas if they do not they will be a mickey mouse organisation. The colleges have much to offer. They have a very fine record and the degree is the icing on the cake.  For technical reasons and to allow time for discussion I want to delay the awarding of degrees for a targeted period of 12 months.  The Deputy's idea that I seek to grant the degree awarding power from the date of the setting up of the formal governing body is not a bad one.  I will see whether I can synchronise the degree awarding power with the coming into effect of the formal governing body.  I want to stress &mdash; I do not wish to be misinterpreted &mdash; that the Dublin Institute of Technology will have the degree awarding power subject to technical discussions with the interim governing body.  I do not want words to be put in my mouth that I am in any way seeking to prevent that from happening. I have to go through a process, which I will do as quickly as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2281" /> This Bill is an historic initiative setting up the Dublin Institute of Technology on a full statutory basis.  I pay tribute to the Dublin Institute of Technology and their colleges for the outstanding contribution they have made to the development of third level education.  The graduates of the Dublin Institute of Technology are recognised internationally.  They have concentrated in key areas on social disciplines such as engineering, science, architecture, business, marketing, catering and music.  They are arguably the largest third level institute in the State. I, as Minister for Education, have every confidence in the Dublin Institute of Technology and in their future contribution to teaching and to research. They will get from me the full support they have had up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made the case very forcibly, three times during this conclusion, that we are putting in place a very historic structure, and that is so.  As we are putting in place legislation that will chart the course of third-level education in the technical, vocational and apprenticeship areas for the next 30 of 40 years we should do the job <i>in toto</i> from the start.  I do not accept the Minister's argument in relation to the technical difficulties.  The academic council can be set up shortly after the governing body come into being &mdash; the governing body nominate the academic council.  I envisage that within a matter of three to four weeks after the coming on stream of this legislation the governing body can be up and running.  We know the components of that body &mdash; members of the vocational education committees, representatives from organisations nominated by the vocational education committee, members of the academic council and the non-academic council, ICTU and the students.  The components are pre-determined and it is a case of asking the respective bodies, bearing in mind the gender equity clause, to come up with the nominees.  The Minister has decided that he will nominate the chairman. Therefore the whole body can be in place within a matter of three to four weeks.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2282" /> The academic council will be the quality control body.  I have no doubt quality control will be of paramount importance in deciding on degrees, diplomas and certificates and what courses will achieve degree status.  I do not see why we cannot, as a launching pad, consider the 15 or 16 courses that are currently validated by Trinity College as areas in which these colleges will award degrees.  The Minister said he is delaying the giving of the degree awarding power out of courtesy to the colleges.  The point made by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Enright is valid, bearing in mind the spirit of section 5 (2) (a) which states that the institute shall have powers, but these will be &ldquo;futuristic&rdquo; powers.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mac Giolla said and as was reiterated by Deputy Enright, we do not doubt the Minister's bona fides nor his good intentions, but no other Minister is bound by this.  Whether the Minister is the Minister for Justice, the EC Commissioner or the Taoiseach, nobody is bound by the commitment he has given here tonight.  If the Minister is really sincere in relation to his promise that it will come into effect within a period of 12 months, the way to do it is to introduce an amendment to this effect in the Seanad.  The Minister should put in an amendment to the effect that within a period of not more than 12 months after the coming into effect of this legislation, these colleges will be awarded the right to confer, give or award degrees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Health make a statement on the investigations he has carried out into the commercial working arrangement between the staff members of the Southern Health Board working in the Cork Regional Hospital and the Shandon Drug Research Clinic? This working relationship of an informal nature came to light as a result of questions tabled by me to the Southern Health Board earlier this year.  In reply to questions put by me, the senior management of the Southern Health Board stated they were unaware of any such arrangement in operation in Cork Regional Hospital. In my opinion the senior management of the Southern Health Board showed a lack of commitment to investigate the contents of my question in any realistic way and indicated in a written report to members of the board that they were unaware of any formal arrangement between the Shandon Drug Research Clinic and the Cork Regional Hospital.  I put a supplementary oral question at a board meeting asking if they were aware of any informal arrangement but they answered in the negative.</P>
      <P>At my insistence the health board carried out an investigation as a result of my question and discovered that senior staff members of Cork Regional Hospital were engaged in operating a business with the Shandon Drug Research Clinic, whereby subjects from the clinic were brought to Cork Regional Hospital and underwent tests on a regular basis.  Needless to say this practice was continuing at a time when there were massive cutbacks in the services which were being offered to the public at Cork Regional Hospital. People had to wait up to two years for preliminary assessment appointments and in some cases they had to wait for over two years for surgery.  In addition Cork Regional Hospital closed 63 beds this week, Bantry hospital have closed 30 beds, the Orthopaedic Hospital in Cork have closed 28 beds and Tralee Hospital have closed 45 beds, making a total of 166 beds which have been taken out of the system for the summer months. Against this background, individuals within the health services were making substantial amounts of money from their arrangement which involved using health board resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to set out clearly tonight what he proposes to do about the situation.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that, in accordance with the common contract, individuals have the right to carry on in such a manner.  It is highly offensive to me and to many others to see staff who are already well paid making huge amounts of money on an annual basis from arrangements such as this.  Let me add that this is not the first time that such an arrangement has arisen in Cork Regional Hospital.  I am aware of other situations and I find it difficult to accept that senior management of the health board were unaware that this was happening especially as new management structures were put in place there more than 12 months ago, under which structures a hospital manager and four assistant managers were appointed.  Despite the new appointments which strengthened the <Col N="2287" /> management structures, this arrangement carried on without detection until it was raised by means of two questions asked by me.</P>
    <P>Tonight I ask the Minister to set out clearly what he proposes to do now that he has received the report.  Would he please identify the people involved; the money made by those individuals from the Shandon Clinic; the way in which he proposes to recover the money, which money belongs to the taxpayer; and the steps he proposes to take to ensure that the revenue lost to the Southern Health Board is recovered?  There is no point in skirting around the problem.  The people who suffer inconvenience week in and week out, people on a long waiting list, are entitled to know the outcome of the Minister's deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to apologise to Deputy Allen who raised this matter last week. On my way in to the Chamber I was waylaid and consequently, arrived too late to take the debate?  The Deputy was most gracious about the delay and I pay tribute to him for that.</P>
      <P>I have listened with considerable interest to Deputy Allen's contribution and I hope I can reassure him on this matter.</P>
      <P>Some members of the Southern Health Board, as the Deputy will be aware, raised this issue last March, requesting a report on work being carried out by the laboratory at Cork Regional Hospital on behalf of the Shandon Clinic.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Southern Health Board had the matter examined and very shortly afterwards received a report at their meeting on 6 April from the acting chief executive of the board.  I requested and received a copy of this report and I also asked to be advised as to what action was taken on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acting chief executive clarified for the board that a private commercial clinic had been submitting specimens to the laboratory at the regional hospital since early 1990.  However, it will be appreciated that specimens are received by the <Col N="2288" /> hospital from a very wide range of sources.  These are: in-patients of the regional hospital; out-patients of the hospital; general practitioners; other southern health board hospitals; public voluntary hospitals in Cork city; private hospitals in the city; and private commercial clinics.</P>
    <P>In respect of the work carried out for the Shandon Clinic by the laboratory, it was not made known to the management of the regional hospital that this work was being undertaken for the clinic by staff of the hospital.  The former general manager, having being informed of this practice, at once instructed the individuals concerned to stop all work for the clinic while hospital management discussed the situation with the clinic.  The clinic themselves were also informed that the work done on their behalf was being halted.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the management of Cork Regional Hospital, having met representatives of the clinic told that latter that the hospital would carry out work for the clinic provided that (a) payment should be received by the hospital, not consultants, for work carried out to date, and (b) agreement should be reached between both parties on a scale of charges for future work.</P>
    <P>The clinic were presented by the hospital with a bill for work carried out already.  However, no agreement has yet been reached between these parties on the hospital's demands, and negotiations are continuing.  In the meantime, the general manager's direction to laboratory staff to discontinue providing a service for the Shandon Clinic remains in place.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Deputy raised questions at the 2 March meeting of the health board regarding the bills issued by the pathologists at Cork Regional Hospital.  The position is that the stationery, postage, collection and telephone costs in respect of the private fees are not carried by the hospital.  Also, clerical/technical staff are not collecting those fees for the consultants.  A rent is paid to the regional hospital by the consultants for office use in relation to fee collection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> I have been informed that the hospital, which now have a strengthened senior management team, have put in place sufficient controls to ensure that they are aware of all pathology work carried out from sources internal and external to the hospitals.</P>
    <P>The common contract subject to certain conditions allows public hospital facilities to be used by consultants in respect of their private patients. However, I believe that the management of public hospitals can and should negotiate at local level with companies or other organisations who wish to use facilities so that a return is provided for the public hospital.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that our laboratories are staffed by professionals of the highest quality and equipped to very high standards. It is critical that these resources be utilised to their optimum for the benefit of patient care.  I propose to ensure that hospital management are encouraged and supported in every way possible to achieve this.  The Hospital Value For Money Steering Group, which is chaired by an assistant secretary from my Department, have identified the management of pathology services in our major hospitals as an issue to be addressed this year.  In a value for money context my Department are working closely with the chief executive officers and senior laboratory staff of five of our major acute hospitals, including Cork Regional Hospital, and as recently as 28 May last held a very constructive one-day seminar with representatives of the hospitals concerned.</P>
    <P>The cost of laboratory services is growing from year to year and we are now at a stage at which laboratory costs can amount to up to 12 per cent of in-patient costs in our major hospitals.  There are many reasons for this, for example, increased reliance on test results, increased turnover of patients, etc.  I am convinced that while our laboratories make a very significant contribution to patient care it is absolutely necessary that the best return is achieved from their work, including maximising all income possibilities.  To achieve this we must improve our information on workloads, <Col N="2290" /> outputs and costings and make the efficacy of our laboratory services more transparent than it is at present.  I have no doubt that the necessary support and co-operation will be forthcoming from the hospitals and, in particular, from laboratory staff so that we can provide the best service to our patients.</P>
    <P>While there is a need to maximise the potential for income in laboratories, I am also placing particular emphasis this year on the need for agencies to pursue all possible income generation initiatives so that we can maximise the resources available for patient care.  The pursuit of all possible value for money initiatives, including income generation, is vital if we are to maintain services and standards in our hospitals; this, of course, must be balanced with the requirements of patient care, which must always be the main priority of the health services.</P>
    <P>Obviously, to maximise the income generation opportunities, agencies will have to rely on the support and co-operation of all staff.  It is very important that staff are fully informed of the policies, plans and procedures adopted at individual agency level and are encouraged by management to ensure that the resources of each agency are utilised to their full potential.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to re-emphasise that all agencies should now assess the potential for income generation in respect of services provided by them or that should be provided by them.  My Department will be in contact with agencies on this matter shortly.  I believe that the former position in Cork Regional Hospital regarding the use of laboratory resources by a small number of staff unknown to hospital management is something that must be avoided in the future.  This can only be avoided when all health service staff are fully aware of and accept the management responsibility to follow up and implement all income opportunities so that quality services can be delivered to their patients.</P>
    <P>Finally, I assure the Deputy that I will bring the points he has raised to the attention of my Department and that these points will be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chairman of the Adelaide Board of Management stated last month that he had been instructed by the board to announce that the position of the hospital was so grave that the hospital might soon be forced to close.</P>
      <P>Detailed proposals were drawn up more than ten years ago under which three inner-city hospitals, the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital in Harcourt Street, would close and would be amalgamated into a regional hospital in Tallaght. Negotiations have been held for the past two years between the Government and the board of the Adelaide Hospital, whose traditions are specifically Protestant, to guarantee that the ethos of the hospital would be maintained in the new hospital.  The former Taoiseach had guaranteed that and the discussions centred on the constitution of the new board, which would uphold the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital.  The hospital would cost around £180 million, including an estimated £165 million for the first phase of 450 beds.  It would take four years to build and 18 months to commission and would be the biggest single health project ever undertaken in this State.</P>
      <P>To date some £10 million has been spent on the project designed to serve a population of 320,000 people.  However, even though the first sod was turned in 1986 on a site near the square, the area's main shopping centre, it was not included in the Government's capital allocation either this year or last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last June a formula was accepted in principle by the Adelaide Hospital under which it would have greater representation than the other two hospitals on the board of the Tallaght Hospital.  The <Col N="2292" /> National Children's Hospital also accepted the formula, but the Meath Hospital sought modifications.  The Adelaide board were shocked and dismayed by the Meath Hospital's rejection of parts of the proposal which would have allowed the Adelaide to remain, as it was put, &ldquo;a focus for Protestant participation in the health services&rdquo;.  The Adelaide board concluded that the board of the Meath did not wish the Adelaide Society to have a role on the Tallaght Hospital to the extent that the particular denominational ethos of the Adelaide would be continued in Tallaght, thus ensuring that the new hospital would be supported by the Protestant liberal communities.</P>
    <P>The Adelaide have insisted that they should be granted a dominant role in the management of the hospital in order to preserve their distinctive character and to ensure they could continue medical procedures which, although legal, were not carried out in other public hospitals because they were contrary to Catholic medical ethos.</P>
    <P>The second major reversal for the Tallaght project was the decision by the Government not to fund it in 1992 but instead to refer the whole project for reconsideration by a committee chaired by Dr. David Kennedy.  There is now a belief that the Tallaght Hospital, if this Government build it at all, will be downgraded into a secondary hospital with 350 beds instead of the 600 originally proposed.  If the end result is 350 beds it might not be of sufficient importance to be the teaching hospital at the forefront of Irish medicine and would not be a suitable hospital for the Adelaide School of Nursing and, of course, it would be too small to accommodate the existing three hospitals.</P>
    <P>Last April it emerged that the current Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, had asked the hospital to consider remaining at its current location in the city centre.  The board maintain if it is to stay in Peter Street or in the centre of Dublin, then it must be accommodated in larger and more modern premises.  The Adelaide deferred major capital developments for the past 20 years on the <Col N="2293" /> assumption that it would be moved to a more modern premises.  The hospital also has to address its ongoing financial crisis.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the Adelaide spent £300,000 more than it was allowed by the Department of Health.  This year it has been given an allocation which is about £800,000 less than is needed to keep the hospital going at the same level as in 1991.  In the meantime there is no definite information about Tallaght, no definite information as to the role of the Adelaide, no definite information as to the ethos of the new hospital.  The current Minister for Health has added to the confusion regarding the future of the Adelaide Hospital.</P>
    <P>I believe the Adelaide have played a very important role in Irish medical history and have the potential to make a most valuable contribution in the future. I am calling on the Minister to immediately clarify his position with regard to the future role and funding of the Adelaide Hospital and his intentions regarding the construction of the Tallaght Hospital.  When will this construction commence?  When will it finish?  This impasse must be broken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity once again to reiterate the Government's commitment both to the Tallaght Hospital project and to the protection of the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital.  I have stated this commitment publicly on a number of occasions and am pleased to do so again in the Dáil this evening.</P>
      <P>On the question of funding of the Adelaide, this House is well aware of the difficult economic climate which prevails, and which is likely to do so for the foreseeable future.  I know that many health agencies are experiencing difficulties in living within their approved allocations. The challenge that faces them is enormous, but it is one that must be tackled on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Adelaide Hospital, because of its special teaching role, would like to be in a position to use all of its available beds.  Due to the overall restrictions on resources for the health services, <Col N="2294" /> I regret that this has not been possible for a number of years.  With regard to the funding of the hospital in 1992, I, together with my officials, have met with the hospital authorities and have agreed the parameters, including financial, within which the hospital will function for the remainder of this year.  It has been agreed that the hospital will keep 150 beds open and that it will maintain activity at 1991 levels.</P>
    <P>I hope to be meeting soon again with the hospital to discuss their financial position and other matters.  I had an appointment with them which I have had to postpone, not for any reason that I was not concerned.  I am really more concerned than I could possibly express here, and I hope I will be able to give them good news.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to avail of this opportunity now not alone to place on the record of the Dáil my appreciation, and the Government's appreciation, of the distinctive and valuable contribution made by the Adelaide Hospital to Irish medicine but also to reiterate my commitment to ensure that the traditions of the Adelaide continue to be protected.  I had the pleasure and honour of working in the Adelaide, attending clinics there and receiving much of my training there, and I could not speak well enough of the great work they do.  I mentioned that they might stay, not because I wanted them to stay but they had given a service to the inner city that I thought might be undermined. The Adelaide, as an independent voluntary hospital, has a long distinguished tradition of service to the people of Dublin and no one knows it more than I do.  Anyone who has been associated with or touched by the hospital thinks not just of a high level of professional medical care but of personal individual care.  The ethos of the Adelaide Hospital has played a distinctive role in the development of Irish health care, not alone in its caring approach to the health of Irish people, but also in training past and future generations of nurses and doctors.</P>
    <P>This is in no small part due to the quality of its nurse training.  In this <Col N="2295" /> regard, I am particularly pleased to repeat the categorical assurances given by previous Ministers that this tradition will be maintained in the new hospital at Tallaght and that 40 places in the new nursing school will be reserved for nurses from the Adelaide tradition.</P>
    <P>My motivation is, and has always been, to protect the best interests of the Adelaide Hospital.  I know that there is concern among the Protestant community that the hospital's tradition could be lost or in some way diminished if it were to amalgamate with the two other hospitals, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital, and move to a new campus in Tallaght. Indeed, I am also mindful of the history and traditions of the Meath and the National Children's Hospitals.  Both have made a significant contribution to the development of medicine in Ireland. They too have a very special place in the hearts of the people of the south inner city.  They too have unique traditions which must be protected.  The challenge facing us, therefore, is to ensure that all that is valuable in the traditions of the three hospitals is successfully transferred to the new hospital in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I was very heartened to read the press release from the Meath Hospital in which they went to great lengths to reassure the Adelaide Hospital that they would be able to work in harmony with them in the new hospital.  I assure Deputy Taylor that he and I will see the new hospital built and I hope it will be next year.</P>

      <P>I urge the Government to reconsider their decision to end the alleviation payments which were introduced in 1986 to compensate certain social welfare recipients for losses arising from the application of EC rules on equalisation.  Thousands of social welfare recipients are now receiving letters from the Department of Social Welfare informing them that their payments will end in July.  That is causing them much anxiety and concern.</P>
      <P>These payments were introduced in 1986 to compensate in part people on social welfare who stood to lose considerable sums of money because of the manner in which the then Government chose to implement EC Directive 79/7 on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security.  The original payments were £20 or £10 depending on the circumstances of those involved but, over the years, the payments have been reduced to £12 and £6 respectively.  The cost to the Department of Social Welfare is relatively small compared to their total budget &mdash; less than £2 million &mdash; but hardship for those involved will be considerable.  The categories affected will be mainly those on old age, invalidity or disability pensions, the most vulnerable in society.  These people are already living on or near the breadline and it is simply cruel to snatch the money from them in this way.  There can be no justification for any change in the social welfare code which results in making those who are already poor even poorer. People have, understandably, got used to having the money and depriving them of these payments will create further hardship for them.  No matter what gloss the Minister may try to put on it, this is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost to the Department had been declining steadily since 1987 as the numbers qualifying declined through death, people re-entering the workforce or other change in circumstances.  Originally 29,000 people were receiving payments but this has now declined to fewer than <Col N="2297" /> 10,000 people.  The scheme should have been allowed to wither through natural wastage instead of a rigid termination date being imposed.  It could have been phased out by continuing the yearly clawback of £2 per week each July.</P>
    <P>Members of Democratic Left welcome the decision to pay back-money to women who lost out because of the failure of the Government to implement social welfare equalisation on time in the mid-eighties.  However, it is a pity that this is being funded, in part, by taking money from people who can ill afford the loss.  These families are still paying a heavy price for the botched implementation of social welfare equalisation by the Fine Gael-Labour Government and, particularly, by their decision to equalise downwards rather than by increasing the level of social welfare payments at the time.  The Department are claiming that they took their decision because &ldquo;arising from recent decisions of the European Court of Justice, it has emerged that these alleviating payments are in conflict with the principle of equal treatment&rdquo;. My understanding is that this was not specifically said in the judgment but that it is the Department's interpretation of it.  It may well be that if somebody took a case to the European Court challenging them, the payments might be found to be contrary to the principles of equal treatment.  However, there is no suggestion of any such case being threatened or taken.  I have never heard anyone on social welfare demanding that his or her position should be improved by cutting the income of others on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Every case involving a potential increase for those on social welfare has been fought with great vigour by the Department through the High Court and the Supreme Court and through the European Court of Justice.  However, where people stand to lose is where there is even the potential for a case and that is enough to make the Department cut and run.</P>
    <P>The Department also said that the termination of the payments is being timed to coincide with the date of the implementation of this year's general <Col N="2298" /> social welfare increases, the implication being that people will really not lose that much.  However, the loss will, in many cases, be considerably greater than the additional payment provided for in the Social Welfare Act.  In addition, the general increases are simply in line with inflation and are designed to protect the purchasing power of social welfare payments. No matter how much the Minister may try, there is no way to describe the financial loss that thousands of citizens will have to endure.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to avoid further hardship for these families and allow the payments to continue.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Byrne for allowing me one minute of his time.  As a result of this measure many poor families and pensioners whom I represent have been affected.  I emphasise to the Minister that 10,000 families will be very severely hit and their poverty will be made even more acute by the loss of the alleviating payments.  These people, many of them pensioners, are already in very poor circumstances and this will be a futher cruel blow.  Indeed it is seen by many of them as an unnecessarily savage attack on their meagre incomes.  Will the Minister say why he has to make such a huge cut in their incomes?  Why not continue on a phased basis in a way which will not be such a heavy-handed blow to people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that Deputy Byrne should try to use this matter for his own political gain.  The Deputy knows that there was no alternative to discontinuing these payments.  He also knows that the £60 million being spent by the Government on arrears payments in respect of the period of delay in implementing the 1979 equal treatment directive would have counted for nothing if the alleviating payments had been continued because the courts have taken the view that these payments are in conflict with the principle of equal treatment.</P>
      <P>He has been advised that various options were examined within my Department but the plain fact is that the Government had no option but to discontinue these payments.  He is also aware that many of the families affected will receive very substantial arrears payments under the recently announced package providing for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay in implementing the 1979 directive.  For example, a married women with two children who was on unemployment benefit at that time will receive up to £1,400.  If she was on disability benefit during the period of delay she will receive up to £1,300.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Byrne may chose to ignore all this, I intend to put the facts on the record of this House.  This whole matter is tied in with the EC Directive on equal treatment between men and women in the matter of social security. The Directive should have been implemented in December 1984 but the necessary measures were not brought into force by the then Government until May and November 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to November 1986, a man automatically <Col N="2300" /> qualified for an increase in respect of his wife even if she was in employment or was getting a social welfare payment in her own right.  Under the new dependancy arrangements introduced in November 1986, the adult dependent increase is payable only where the spouse is not in receipt of a social welfare payment in his or her own right and where they do not have income in excess of £55 per week from employment or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The alleviating payments were introduced in November 1986 by the then Government for a 12-month period only to avoid a sudden reduction in income for married men who lost dependency increases under the new dependency arrangements introduced at that time.</P>
    <P>Two different transitional payments were introduced.  Men who lost the adult dependant allowance because their wives were in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right received a transitional payment of £20 in each case and, in addition, they could also apply for special equal treatment payments mainly in respect of credit-hire purchase agreements to buy essential household goods. Men whose wives had an income of £50 per week from employment, lost the adult dependant allowance and half of the child dependant allowance; they received a transitional payment of £10 per week and the half-rate increases for children which they lost were restored.</P>
    <P>While these payments were introduced by the then Government for a 12-month period only, we decided to continue the payments but to phase them out gradually over a period of time.  As a first step, the £20 and £10 payments were reduced by £2 and £1 respectively in July 1988 and the half-rate increases for children were frozen at their July 1987 rate.  The payments have been further reduced on an annual basis coinciding with the budgetary increases and are now £12 and £6 respectively.</P>
    <P>Arising from the delay in implementing the Equal Treatment Directive by the then Government, a number of court <Col N="2301" /> proceedings were initiated by married women.  Having considered the most recent decision of the European Court, the Government decided earlier this year to provide for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay at a cost of £60 million in the period 1992 to 1994.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the courts have also found that the alleviating payments are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment and for this reason, the Government had no option but to discontinue them.  Contrary to what Deputy Byrne said, many cases have been taken in which transitional payments were sought by married women. In order to minimise the impact on people still in receipt of these payments, we decided to discontinue them with effect from the end of July coinciding with the date of implementation of this year's budget increases.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Byrne is well aware, there is absolutely no alternative to terminating the alleviating payments because the courts have found that these payments are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment.  If the payments were not discontinued, the overall equal treatment package would be put at risk which means that despite spending £60 million to make good the failure by the then Government to implement the Directive on time, the matter would still not be resolved.  In addition to this, the European Commission might well proceed with the threatened infringement proceedings against Ireland in the European Court.</P>
    <P>The bottom line in all of this is that the Government are allocating £60 million for the equal treatment package over and above normal expenditure in the social welfare area.  My Department have already identified over 110,000 potential beneficiaries.  Personal claim forms have already been issued automatically to the women concerned and the first payments should be issued within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I am most disappointed that the control of farmyard pollution scheme which was introduced in 1989 and due to operate until 1993 has now been suspended.  I am concerned that new applicants who wish to participate in the scheme will now reconsider whether they should proceed with the work because of the financial implications and the failure to obtain grants.</P>
      <P>This scheme has been very successful, given that over 25,000 farmers have availed of the scheme.  We all remember the fish kills during the summers of the eighties. Thankfully, these fish kills have all but disappeared as the farming sector have responded positively by introducing effective pollution controls.</P>
      <P>Farmers are now much more conscious of the need to contain slurry and silage effluents.  It is imperative that the Minister re-introduce these grants as soon as possible in order to ensure that the achievements in this area over the years are continued.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to re-introduce those grants immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern in raising this matter.  As he is aware, the scheme for the control of farmyard pollution was introduced here in 1989 as an operational programme.  The scheme was to last until 1993 and estimated expenditure was £94 million.  A sum of £66.4 million was allocated out of the Structural Funds to finance this expenditure.</P>
      <P>To date, 27,000 farmers have applied for the scheme and approvals have issued in 25,000 cases, leaving over 2,000 to be dealt with.  These approvals exhaust the estimated expenditure of £94 million and the corresponding expenditure of £66.4 million from the Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that all the outstanding approvals will not reach completion this <Col N="2303" /> year, in which case there would be money available to finance some more approvals.  It has been decided, therefore, to cancel those approvals where the completion date has expired in an effort to find out how many approvals are likely to be completed.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the situation will be clarified shortly.  If by then it is established that a certain number of applicants are not going ahead with their approved work additional approvals can be issued. While it is too soon yet to make a definite forecast of the outcome it is likely that it will be possible to deal with a substantial number of applications on hands within the current financial allocation.</P>
    <P>While new applications will continue to be accepted it will not, however, be possible to deal with them pending a commitment from the European Community as to additional funding.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the importance of this scheme in the control of farmyard pollution and the interest which farmers have in it.  For this reason, in the programme being prepared by the Government for submission to the European Community for a new allocation of Structural Funds, additional finance for this scheme will have priority.  I can confirm that both the Minister for Agriculture and Food and I will do everything possible to secure additional funding under this heading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Towards the end of 1991 the Department of Agriculture and Food invited dairy farmers to opt for a Community milk quota buy-up scheme which is funded by the European Community. Applicants had to submit completed documentation to the Department of Agriculture and Food before 15 January 1992, while successful participants had to cease milk deliveries by 31 March 1992.  According to the explanatory memorandum that was issued by the Department with the application forms &ldquo;payment of the first premium will be <Col N="2304" /> made as soon as possible following the required discontinuation of milk deliveries by 31 March 1992&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Farmers believed this to mean that the first instalment of their payment would arrive soon after 31 March but I suppose this could be interpreted to mean either April or at the latest May.  One can realise their annoyance, therefore, when this phrase was translated by the Department to mean &ldquo;August or, more than likely, September&rdquo;.  This delay is causing cash-flow problems for some of the participants in this scheme, especially for those who have bank repayments to meet.</P>
      <P>At a time when farm incomes are in decline and considering the many expenses incurred by farmers at this time of the year I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, and the Department to review the scheme and to make the promised payments to these farmers immediately or at the least to those farmers who are in financial difficulty because they misread the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Community milk quota buy-up scheme provides for the payment of five annual instalments of 41p per gallon to the producers who offered their quota for surrender under the scheme.  I have instructed my officials to ensure that the initial payment is made as early as possible this year and I hope to be in a position to proceed with the first payment before the end of August.  However, the timing of the payment date is determined by a number of factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before payment can be made, it is necessary to verify the details provided by the applicants relating to quota and land ownership.  In addition, there is a legal obligation on my Department under the Community regulations to ensure that verification checks are carried out to confirm that the production of milk has been totally and definitely discontinued. <Col N="2305" /> I have asked my officials to have these checks concluded as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When the payment system is put in place, I will review the timing of the payments for future years.  If it is found to be possible to bring forward the payment date the necessary arrangements will be made.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the two Deputies present in the House that we attach considerable importance to the need to ensure that all grants due to farmers are paid in the year of eligibility.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise a very important matter.  It is exactly one year since the appeal forms were to be submitted, in accordance with departmental regulations for the appeals system, under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I wish to put some points to the Minister of State.  The appeals panel has sat and I understand the computations and figures are being collated by way of computer input.  Will the appeals panel go to the farmers and explain the failures in areas where the benefits under the scheme are less than satisfactory or will the Official Secrets Act be applied?  I urge the Minister to consider introducing a procedure similar to that which operates under the driving test scheme.  If there is a difficulty it should at least be explained to the aggrieved farmer.</P>
      <P>I am raising this question not only on my own behalf but on behalf of a large number of farmers in the Minister's constituency. The Minister should clear the air as far as this confusion and delay is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that farmers are uncertain regarding the appeals system and I ask the Minister to clarify the position concerning payments.  It is not so long ago that a predecessor in the Department, Deputy O'Kennedy, gave a guarantee that payments would be made under the appeals system in respect of 1991.  However, not only are the payments in respect of 1991 in doubt but so <Col N="2306" /> also are those in respect of 1992.  In fact, it may be that the submission will not be made to Brussels until 1993.  If that is the case undoubtedly the farmers and people in the agri-industry will be in a very precarious position.</P>
    <P>In response to a recent parliamentary question it was stated that the inputting of these figures into computer would take until the autumn.  With the advanced technology available to the Minister in the Department, it may not take as long as five or six months to input these figures. When will the submission go to Brussels for final approval?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Flanagan's concern in raising the question of the disadvantaged areas because both he and I have been over the course in relation to the problems of the disadvantaged areas.  I am glad to have the opportunity of responding to his question. As the Deputy said the appeal panel has completed the three preliminary phases of the appeals procedure in respect of areas not included in the recent extension of the disadvantaged areas. These phases consisted of the receipt of some 1,600 appeal applications from farming representatives and the processing of these applications and the arranging of a survey by Department inspectors of the areas from which appeals were submitted.  In addition, the panel has carried out visits to various centres in the country and has met with representatives of farming groups who submitted appeals.</P>
      <P>The next phase involves the processing on computer of all data from the 40,000 farms inspected in the survey.  The Deputy will acknowledge that in this survey we collected data from all the 40,000 farmers who made applications under the appeals system.  When this task is completed the panel will examine the survey results and make recommendations to the Department as to areas to be included in a submission to Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2307" /> The panel has also invited appeal applications in respect of reclassification. About 700 applications have been received.  When the listing and processing of these appeals is completed at the end of this month the panel will review each area under appeal and assess the situation in regard to reclassification.  I assure Deputy Flanagan that there will be no delay in bringing this appeal procedure to what I hope will be a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>We set targets in relation to the various stages of the survey and we are on target in relation to each of these phases.  Much care and attention has been given by the field inspectors of the Department and that has been recognised by the farmers visited by these inspectors.  Farmers acknowledge that we have done everything possible to ensure that all the information required for the appeals system has been put on file.  I assure the Deputy there will be no delay in bringing this matter to what, hopefully, will be a satisfactory conclusion both for the farmers and the country.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the question of advance factory facilities in the town of Tuam, an issue I raised in the House on many occasions.  I received a written reply from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 20 February 1990 stating that the IDA were in discussion with private developers regarding the provision of a 20,000 square feet advance factory in Tuam.  Later that year the IDA confirmed that they had finalised details with Irish Sugar Company and a private developer for the construction of this advance factory.  However, there was a problem in that the factory was to be built in Airglooney where there were no proper water and sewerage facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had to wait until there was a revised agreement between Greencore and the Tuam Community Group on 13 Febryuary 1992 which indicated that there was an arrangement to have the construction <Col N="2308" /> of this advance factory on the IDA site at Dunmore Road, Tuam.  The importance of this site is that it already has public water and sewerage services. The announcement was very welcome.  It was also good to hear Greencore say they were going to underwrite the rent of the factory for three years or, in the event of private funding not being forthcoming, the company would directly pay for the construction of the factory from the £2 million Tuam investment fund.  That money was promised by the Sugar Company when they left the town of Tuam. They were also going to assign executives, Mr. Marius Martin and Mr. Richard Ryan, to work with the IDA to ensure that the factory was occupied.  I would like to pay tribute to those two gentlemen.</P>
    <P>They further stated that when factory number one had secured a tenant the company would proceed with the development of a similar factory also on the IDA site on the same basis.  Greencore were also not forgetting the site at Airglooney where they allocated 22 to 30 acres for other development if that was needed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the announcement carried by the <i>Tuam Herald</i> on 22 February seemed to indicate that this work would commence within a month and I hope we will soon have an announcement from the Minister.  I wish to thank the Minister and, indeed, all he people who went on the delegation to Greencore, particularly the State agencies, the IDA, the county development team, Galway County Council, FÁS.  I wish to thank the Ministers of State for their work to date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision by the Government on 2 August 1990 to restructure the Irish <Col N="2309" /> Sugar Company stipulated that the company should give an undertaking to provide a free site and a contribution of £2 million towards the establishment of a new industry in Tuam.  As a consequence of the Government decision an agreement between the Sugar Company and Tuam Community Group was arrived at on 13 November 1990 and was revised in February 1992.  Under the terms of the revised agreement, the Irish Sugar Company undertook to submit a planning application for the construction of a standard 20,000 square foot factory on an IDA serviced site at Dunmore Road, Tuam and to underwrite the rent of the factory for three years.  In the absence of private funding the company agreed to pay directly for the construction of the factory out of the £2 million fund and to assign two of its executives to work with the IDA to ensure that the factory is occupied.</P>
    <P>The company also agreed that following the placing of a tenant in the first factory it would develop another similar type factory on the IDA site on the same basis as the first one.  Following the occupation of the two factories the company will meet with the Tuam Community Group to consider further investment taking into account progress and expenditure to date.</P>
    <P>In addition should other sites be required for factories the company will allocate 22 to 30 acres for development at the old Sugar Company factory site in Airglooney.  The contribution to Action Tuam Limited of £250,000, from the £2 million commitment for the construction of an enterprise centre at Weir Road, Tuam is retained in the revised agreement. The company will also favourably consider further investment in Tuam additional to the £2 million committed, where viable and suitable projects are proposed.</P>
    <P>As private funds were not forthcoming, Irish Sugar is to have a factory constructed on the IDA site at Dunmore Road.  The company will own the factory <Col N="2310" /> and so will be renting it out to the occupier, that is it will not be underwriting the rent for three years as set out in the agreement, which only applied in the case of a private developer having developed the site and serviced it as necessary.  Notification of a decision under Article 28 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, granting planning permission was sent by Galway County Council to Irish Sugar on 3 June 1992.  I understand that Irish Sugar will be inviting tenders next week from suitable applicants for the erection of the factory, and it is hoped that building will commence by the end of August next.  The factory will be marketed by the Industrial Development Authority and it is expected that the factory will be ready for occupation early in 1993.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated by the company from the £2 million commitment to Action Tuam Limited to go towards the purchase and construction of the enterprise centre at Weir Road, Tuam is £250,000.  To date, about £200,000 has been paid over to this organisation.</P>
    <P>In so far as employment prospects generally are concerned, IDA supported manufacturing and internationally traded service companies in the west region, both large and small, performed well in 1991 despite the difficult economic climate and in the process created almost 800 new first-time jobs in counties Mayo and Galway.  In a year which saw the continuation of the international recession and employment decline amongst our main trading partners, the numbers of people in manufacturing and international service businesses actually increased in the west region.  The IDA are operating a number of specific programmes with Irish companies to achieve defined growth targets.  The continuing growth of several companies around the region is testimony to the success of this approach &mdash; Poldy's Fresh Foods in Portumna, one of the most successful companies in the region, Dubarry Shoes in Ballinasloe, who are operating in both <Col N="2311" /> the national and international markets very successfully and Connaught electronics at Tuam who manufacture a range of car alarms for a number of European markets.</P>
    <P>Despite the turbulence of the international marketplace, the electronics and engineering sector also saw progress during the year with many companies recruiting additional employees around the west region.  In Tuam, Pulse Engineering <Col N="2312" /> have shown their commitment to enhancing their business with further expansion of their research and development activity.  The IDA have assured me that they will continue to promote Tuam as a location for investment and to work closely with local industry and local groups to increase industrial development in Tuam.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 July 1992.</P>

      <P>The Government's five year tourism targets require an increase in foreign tourism revenue to £1.23 billion for 1992, and current indications are that this figure will be reached, if not exceeded by year end.</P>
      <P>Provisional estimates for the first five months of 1992 show a return to growth in overall visitor numbers with strong recovery in North America and continued growth in particular out of Mainland Europe.  After the slight overall fall in visitor numbers last year, Bord Fáilte are aiming to achieve double digit growth in 1992 and numbers from North America are expected to exceed 400,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 24, 34 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>At their meeting on 22/23 June 1992, the EC Council of Minister (Transport) adopted three Regulations which represent the third phase in the liberalisation of air transport in the EC and which will create a Single Market in air transport with effect from 1 January next.</P>
      <P>They also reached broad agreement on:-</P>
      <P>&mdash; two regulations in the competition area.  Formal conclusions will be reached when Ministers have received the Opinion of the European Parliament on the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; Presidency proposals regarding cabotage in the road passenger transport <Col N="2101" /> sector involving regular and non-regular services.</P>
    <P>In relation to air traffic control systems, the Commission indicated that it would report to the December Council on measures to promote greater co-ordination among States and the Agencies involved in this area.</P>
    <P>Ministers had a broad exchange of views on the subject of fiscal harmonisation in road transport as a result of which the Commission were invited to come forward with more detailed information later this year.</P>
    <P>Proposals relating to cabotage in the road freight sector and external relations in the inland waterways sector were discussed but no firm conclusions were reached.</P>
    <P>The main outcome of the Council related to the air transport sector.  As part of the measures agreed, airlines which are owned and controlled by Community interests will have, from 1 January next, access to routes within the Community for scheduled and non-scheduled services, without restriction on the fares to be charged, the capacity to be mounted or frequency to be operated. The exercise of traffic rights on routes within Member States will be implemented on a phased basis up until 1 April, 1997.</P>
    <P>The regulation on rates and fares establishes a system of free pricing under which air carriers will have freedom to set fares in accordance with their own commercial judgment.</P>
    <P>The regulation on licensing of air carriers will set common standards for issuing licences to ensure that they are financially viable and that their operations meet national safety and technical standards, which will be harmonised in due course.</P>
    <P>The package also contains a number of safeguards and measures to promote a healthy marketplace.</P>
    <P>The airline industry in Ireland has been gearing up to Single Market conditions since 1987.  The liberalisation of policies pursued over that period have led to a reduction in air fares, and significant airline <Col N="2102" /> growth and expansion as is evidenced by the marked increase in number of level of services operated and the numbers employed by them.  The tourism industry has also benefited considerably as is evident from the marked increase in the numbers visiting Ireland and the income generated as a result.  I would hope that Irish airlines will continue to avail of the new opportunities presented to them under Single Market conditions.</P>
    <P>The two airline policy introduced in 1989, under which both Aer Lingus and Ryanair are restricted in the routes they may serve, falls to be reviewed by the end of the year.  The measures agreed at the recent EC Council will be taken into account as part of that review.</P>
    <P>The measures agreed in relation to the road transport sector are of modest proportions with no major implications for the transport industry.</P>

      <P>The surplus staff arise mainly in the telephone operator grade (a surplus caused by the automation of the system) and in the technical area (due to improvements in technology).</P>

    <P>Due to the non-existence of dry docking facilities in the Galway area, it has been the practice for many years that the bottom survey may, with permission of the surveyor, be carried out on a slipway, strand or beach provided that the vessel is raised on wooden sleepers to a height sufficient for the survey to take place. Should any defects be discovered during the survey which would necessitate the vessel proceeding to a proper dry dock facility then this is undertaken by the owner.</P>

      <P>All I propose to say in this case is that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a complaint was received by them in November last, and the matter is the subject of a Garda investigation which will be concluded as soon as possible. The Garda have also informed me that other matters referred to them by the complainant were the subject of a Garda investigation in 1990 and the complainant is aware of the outcome of that investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that a complete ban on drinking in public places would be desirable. Such a ban would be open to the criticism that it would be both inappropriate and disproportionate because it would penalise responsible and well-behaved people who cause no annoyance to others.  The law already contains provisions to deal with public drunkenness or disorderly behaviour.  The 1988 Intoxicating Liquor Act deals with under-age drinking in public places and the 1992 Environmental Protection Agency Act substantially increased penalties for public health nuisances and breaches of by-laws made by local authorities to counter such abuses in public parks.</P>
      <P>However, I agree that something further needs to be done to deal with those elements in our society whose conduct in public is made worse by alcohol abuse. As I have already stated I am at present considering specific proposals for new offences relating to public drunkenness; the use of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in public; and, disorderly conduct which is likely to cause annoyance. I hope to include any provisions which may be necessary in a Criminal Justice Bill which is being prepared in my Department at present and which will be published in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that there are approximately 600 gardaí employed in a full-time clerical capacity in designated clerical posts.  Of course there are many other members of the Force who are regularly if not permanently engaged <Col N="2118" /> on clerical duties in non-designated indoor posts.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the number of gardaí working in offices is excessive and I believe that there is scope for further civilianisation in the Force.  A review is being carried out at present by the Garda authorities to decide on the additional areas within the Force where civilians could be employed.</P>
      <P>There are 585 civilian staff employed in the Garda Síochána at present which is the highest number ever.  A further 105 civilian staff will be recruited this year and they will be assigned to posts which will release an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties.  I plan to increase significantly the numbers of civilians employed in the Force over the next few years.</P>

In addition a new unit, which will be completed this year, is being provided in Mountjoy Prison to cater for the special needs of persons suffering from communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS.  I understand that the Advisory Group on Communicable Diseases, which was set up by my predecessor to advise on future policies for the management of prisoners suffering from communicable diseases, is finalising its report and that I may expect to have it shortly.

      <P>The boys and girls national schools, Glenties, County Donegal were amalgamated in September 1987.  The combined enrolment of the two schools was 229 pupils in the 1986-87 school year. This enrolment warranted a staff of principal, vice principal and five assistants, a total of seven teachers which was the number of teachers in the two schools.</P>
      <P>The enrolment in the school has since dropped to 195 which under the current staffing schedule warrants a staff of principal, vice principal and four assistants.</P>

      <P>My objective is that An Post is in a position to provide an efficient and cost effective postal system, with capacity to adapt to changing customer requirements and to generate adequate revenue to fund the necessary capital investment.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, An Post is in serious financial difficulty and the company have drawn up cost-saving measures to reverse their loss-making.  Some of these measures have already been introduced and the company are negotiating with the unions on further such measures. The first priority of An Post is, therefore, to restore the company to financial health.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding its financial problems An Post are making good progress in their modernisation and development plans.  The company are providing a new national mails sorting centre in Dublin to replace the existing unsatisfactory building at Sheriff Street.  The new centre will provide automation and computerisation of letter sorting through the use of optical character readers and video encoding techniques.  New delivery and mail collection centres have been completed by An Post in Dublin 1 and 2 postal districts and await occupation.  In addition, the company will continue to introduce new mail products where customer needs so require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post have made significant progress with their two major counters services <Col N="2133" /> customers &mdash; the Department of Social Welfare and the National Treasury Management Agency &mdash; on a project for the installation of modern computer systems at 600 post offices.  The project will automate over 80 per cent of counters transactions and will enable An Post to win increased business from existing and new customers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the current negotiations on the review of the general medical services contract, the Irish Medical Organisation have raised the issue of the manner in which withholding tax is <Col N="2139" /> applied to general practitioners.  While I do not wish to comment in detail on any specific matter currently under discussion in the context of the GMS review, all of the issues raised by the Irish Medical Organisation will be given full and detailed consideration by the management side representatives.  I should also point out to the Deputy that policy on the operation of withholding tax is a matter for the Minister for Finance and any proposed changes in the manner in which this tax is applied would be a matter for him.</P>

      <P>In recent years there has been a steady decline in the number of children being placed for adoption.  This is evidenced by the fact that the number of adoption orders has fallen from 1,191 in 1981 to 648 in 1990.  There are now far more people wishing to adopt than there are children available for adoption and the unfortunate result is that prospective adoptive parents are having to wait longer before a child is placed with them. I fully appreciate that this is a time of great anxiety and uncertainty for the couples concerned and I have every sympathy for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not collected, as a matter of routine, by my Department or by the <Col N="2140" /> Adoption Board.  The long waiting periods being experienced by prospective adopters are directly related to the continuing decline in the number of children being given up for adoption and the collection of the information in question will have no impact on the situation.</P>
    <P>The annual reports of the Adoption Board contain useful information about adoption placements which might be of interest to the Deputy.  I am arranging to have a copy of the most recent report published by the board forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The question of the amendment <Col N="2144" /> of Protocol 17 of the Treaty on European Union was discussed by Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 6 April last. At the meeting I explained to partners that, in the light of the Supreme Court judgment in the case of the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X and Others, Ireland wished to amend Protocol 17 to provide expressly for freedom to travel and to provide and obtain information in relation to services lawfully available in the other member states.  I did not table a formal proposal for amendment of the Protocol in advance of hearing the views of partners at ministerial level.</P>
      <P>The reaction of partners was as outlined in paragraph 1.28 of the White Paper on the Treaty on European Union. They had no objection to the substance of Ireland's proposal.  However, a majority of them were unable to agree that Ireland's position be addressed by means of an intergovernmental conference to amend the Treaty of which the Protocol is part.  Partners feared that to agree to any amendment of the Treaty would lead to a list of demands by other member states for other amendments.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances we decided not to proceed with efforts to amend the Protocol. A solemn declaration interpretative of the Protocol was agreed by the Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Guimaraes on 1 May.</P>

      <P>Eligibility for social welfare payments depends on the claimant fulfilling the appropriate contribution conditions or, in the case of social assistance schemes, the appropriate means test.  In recognition of the special circumstances of people with HIV/AIDS, provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1991, to exempt for means test purposes any income derived from the haemophilia HIV trust fund established by the Government.</P>
      <P>There are no plans for further changes in the conditions of eligibility for the people concerned.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to a similar question on 27 May last, the only EC Directive applicable to my Department which has not yet been implemented is Directive 86/613/EC which concerns access to social insurance coverage for spouses of self-employed workers.  The relevant provisions in this Directive should have been implemented not later than 30 June 1989.</P>
      <P>The question of implementing this Directive is currently being examined by the National Pensions Board in the context of their report on a new pension system.  Possible legislation in this area will be considered in the light of that report.</P>
