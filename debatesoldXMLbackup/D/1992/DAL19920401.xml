      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle I wish to give you notice of my intention to raise an urgent matter requiring immediate attention under Standing Order 30 at the commencement of public business.  The matter I wish to raise is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House views with extreme concern the latest controversy to affect the neurosurgery department at Beaumont Hospital which has greatly damaged the morale and reputation of the hospital.  The House is concerned that an independent report covering aspects of the controversy prepared by a widely respected consultant from the University of Nottingham has been available to the Medical Council for <Col N="2" /> several weeks and has not been acted upon.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to take steps immediately to ensure that all inquiries in this matter take place in public and that the independent report available on these issues is examined immediately by the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by Standing Order 30.  Therefore I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 9, 10 and 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding <Col N="3" /> anything in Standing Orders, that (1) business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight; (2) the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 9, up to and including section 97, if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment; (e) the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 10, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set down by the Minister for Social Welfare; (4) The Second Stage of No. 2 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon and on the remaining Stages, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 21, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that business be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 9 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's agreement to a proposal yesterday by Deputy Howlin may I suggest that the same procedures to which he agreed yesterday should apply today. That could be achieved by adding the words &ldquo;or acceptable to&rdquo; and inserting them before the words &ldquo;the Minister for the Environment&rdquo;.  This would allow the Minister to accept Opposition amendments and I suggest the order be amended to make provision for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="4" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with the Report and Final Stages of the Social Welfare Bill agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of No. 10 I propose that we substitute 10.30 p.m. for 7 p.m. as the conclusion time for this debate.  There are 21 amendments to this Bill and, under present arrangements, it is proposed to deal with the legislation in three hours.  Most people in the country consider this the most important Bill the Dáil passes in any year.  I suggest we allow those extra two hours for the debate on this very important matter.  I do not believe that would disrupt the Government programme unduly and I hope all parties in the House will agree to this amendment to the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose the guillotining of the debate on Report Stage of the Social Welfare Bill.  On Committee Stage most of the sections were not reached.  There is no agreement between the Whips on the taking of the Bill and because it impacts on nearly half the population adequate time should be afforded on Report Stage for proper debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the guillotining of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  It is a disastrous Bill which will reduce the income of thousands of families who depend on social welfare for a half decent existence.  The amount of time being allocated for the 21 amendments tabled for Report Stage works out at less than nine minutes per amendment. That is totally inadequate and it is not the proper way to deal with such serious legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the proposal for dealing with the Social Welfare Bill and the amendments I am putting the following question: &ldquo;That the time proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Taoiseach did not get an opportunity to indicate whether he accepts the proposal <Col N="5" /> that we sit until 10.30 p.m.  Would he like to respond to that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the clarification of the House, we are sitting until 10.30 p.m. All parties would accept and admit that the ACC Bank Bill, which is a technical Bill, is required urgently.  If the parties decide to let it through in half an hour, we can add time to the Social Welfare Bill but that is as much as I can offer the House.  The Bill is required and it cannot be left over until next week or the week after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot permit a debate on the matter now.  I will permit a brief comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government agree to allocate the extra hours to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill my party would be agreeable to taking the ACC Bank Bill tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different proposition from the one I put to the House. I am prepared to facilitate the Opposition if they are prepared to agree to a short technical Bill that is urgently required. Time is against us.  We need it tonight, not tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="6" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach is interested in consensus he might have to get used to accepting other people's ideas from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This should not give rise to debate or argument now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Member who will be dealing with the ACC Bank Bill on behalf of the Labour Party I am prepared to make an offer to the Taoiseach, in response to what he said.  If he wishes we can sit until midnight to take that technical Bill as he described it.  It would require no more than an hour or an hour and a half.  If the Whips consider debating, as suggested by Deputy Bruton, the Social Welfare Bill until 10.30 p.m. and devote one hour or so after to deal with the ACC Bank Bill, the Labour Party will facilitate the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand why we cannot deal with the Report Stage of the Social Welfare Bill until it is completed.  The proposal that the time be extended to 10.30 p.m. amounts to about five minutes extra per amendment which is totally inadequate.  We are not prepared to support any extension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not agree to this either.  This legislation involves a major change in the operation of a State bank. It requires complex examination, and Committee Stage examination of the individual clauses of the 14 section Bill. It is not reasonable to put that through in the space of a very short time, two hours, late at night in this House.  The operations of ACC, whose borrowings are guaranteed by the State, are sufficiently important to warrant more time than that.  The Government should not persist on this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the ACC Bill will be even shorter than indicated by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, because the vote on Private Members' business tonight will eat into part of the time allocated.  In principle, it is a bad thing for matters of this kind to be simply tabled for debate in a way which ensures that most people in this House who may have an interest in making a contribution will not have an opportunity to make it.  We cannot deal in such an off-hand manner with financial institutions in particular, in this way, given the record of financial institutions in this country.</P>

      <P>In page 57, subsection (1), line 38, after &ldquo;activity&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which requires a licence or permit for control of water pollution, air pollution, waste, noise or other emission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment stands in my name, together with those of Deputies Donal Carey and Bernard Allen.  In the amendment we seek to add in the first line of section 80 (1) after the word &ldquo;activity&rdquo; the words &ldquo;which requires a licence or permit for control of water pollution, air pollution, waste, noise or other emission&rdquo;. The section as it stands is not specific enough and we should like it to be made clear that a person should not carry on an activity which requires a licence or permit for control of water pollution, air pollution, waste, noise or other emission other than an established activity.  I hope that the Minister can accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we are dealing with the fundamental issue in the Bill.  At the outset I was concerned, as were the Government, not to establish just another State agency, not to put in place another layer of bureaucracy that would stand in the way of planning, development and progress.  Neither did we want an agency that would have the <Col N="28" /> name, the Environmental Protection Agency, but would be, effectively, toothless so far as real power was concerned. Previously we have had many bodies of this kind and although they can do extraordinarily good work from a research or general point of view, when it comes to the crunch of making decisions, putting controls in place, enforcing the controls and seeking to have those who do not abide by the controls prosecuted, they do not have the teeth required to that.  We do not need another body of that kind, which is why I was keen to ensure that this agency would have the power to license those activities that can cause a serious threat in terms of pollution if not carried out in an environmentally satisfactory way.</P>
      <P>It is for precisely that reason that in section 80 we are introducing the concept of integrated pollution control.  As Deputies know, at the moment for certain activities planning permission is required from the local authority and if there is an appeal it is adjudicated on by An Bord Pleanála &mdash; a waste permit is required under waste regulations, under the Water Pollution Act a water pollution licence is required if there is to be a discharge into waters and an air pollution licence is required if there are to be emissions into the atmosphere.  That procedure is sizeable, cumbersome and is not environmentally satisfactory.  On many occasions, although air, water and soil are different media, all of them emit substances into the environment which could have a detrimental effect if not properly controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is not appropriate that all these matters be examined separately.  It makes much more sense to bring all the environmental media together, to have the integrated pollution control licence A1 operating permit given in respect of the manner in which the activity can be controlled and operated as far as the natural environment is concerned.  We have three different permits &mdash; which nobody could possibly justify &mdash; because, at different times, different requirements were either imposed on us or required of us because of European obligations or we <Col N="29" /> saw fit to introduce different provisions to deal with emissions into the air, discharges into waters or to regulate and control disposal of waste.</P>
    <P>What we are doing here is novel and forward thinking.  Even at European level there are discussions and proposals in relation to integrated pollution control but that concept is still very far from being adopted and will not be in place for some time.  Very few countries have reached the stage at which they can introduce an integrated pollution control licence.</P>
    <P>What Deputies seek to do is remove from the ambit of the agency power to adjudicate and grant such licences.  It is my belief that that would be unsatisfactory. Deputies seek not merely to leave that power with the existing 33 local authorities but to extend it to our 87 or 88 different sanitary authorities.  I want Deputies to reconsider its repercussions. For example, in a small country like ours with limited resources, at a very early stage of development it would not be possible to give even each of the existing 33 local authorities the kind of resources, by way of manpower and equipment, to allow them properly assess many of the very technical and complex processes outlined in the First Schedule.  For example, there is mention of the chemical pharmaceutical industry and activities in the agri group sector, which have developed enormously in recent years.</P>
    <P>The processes about which we speak are complex requiring thorough, expensive expertise.  It would not be possible, in the case of every local authority, to provide that expertise and, even if we could provide it, to duplicate it nationwide; it would be a waste of public resources. For example, in some local authority areas there might be one such activity only.  That begs the question: if one such activity required expertise and technical equipment, would it be reasonable to expect that local authority or the Exchequer to fork out the resources to allow the relevant local authority have what is required?</P>
    <P>In drafting this Bill I engaged in widespread consultation with many organisations, <Col N="30" /> mainly those concerned with the environment, but also with many professional bodies, representatives of local authorities, city and county managers and representatives of Irish industry.  At the outset the people who were most impressed that we intended to introduce the concept of integrated pollution control, and give that power to the new agency, were the environmental organisations; that is a fact.  Since the Bill was published I know that many of them have changed their minds.  No doubt if this Bill were to hang around for another couple of years many other people would change their views or perspective of what the agency is all about.</P>
    <P>I do not criticise people for changing their minds; I too have had a rethink on certain matters.  That is what the overall activities of this House should be about &mdash; what the processing of legislation through the Oireachtas should be about &mdash; opening one's mind to a different approach if one can be persuaded that it is warranted or is in order.  That is why I shall be keen to accept, so far as I can, amendments tabled by the Opposition, both here and in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>There are no hard and fast rules I suppose, if one were beginning to devise a system for the operation of our planning laws or licensing certain activities, one might do many things differently.  The fact is local authorities are in place with enormous powers as far as planning and development are concerned.  It is not my wish to seek to remove those powers for the sake of their removal but rather to help those local authorities by establishing a body that is capable, because it will have the expertise, resources, knowledge and, most important of all, will be able to make proper use of our scarce resources in the most effective manner. Therefore, I am not at liberty, nor do I believe it to be acceptable, to seek to change what is to me a fundamental matter as far as this proposed agency is concerned.</P>
    <P>If we remove the power of that agency to control and licence certain activities, and, enforce those controls, then effectively all we will be left with will be an <Col N="31" /> agency that is, of its nature, an advisory body involved in research, co-ordinating matters, drawing up various reports and so on.  At the end of the day, when it comes to how we can prevent pollution that agency would be virtually toothless. That would be a waste of resources and would lead to the public being disappointed about their perception and expectations of this agency.</P>
    <P>There will always be inconsistencies between local authorities.  Let us face it, there are at present many such inconsistencies for example, any developer will tell you that an application submitted to one local authority might be viewed in one way while in another local authority different sets of conditions might be imposed.  That will always be the case where there are 33, 80, or whatever may be the number of local authorities concerned. No matter how we extend the definition of sanitary or local authority there will always be different interpretations when such a disparate group of people interpret what is required in a small country like ours, where competition is keen, where it is important for our future that industrial development be allowed to thrive and in the context of proper environmental controls being consistent, even-handed and applied fairly nationwide.</P>
    <P>When establishing this Environmental Protection Agency, the most appropriate thing to do is to give them the teeth and resources to assess licences thereafter, control activities and enforce the conditions of those licences; to give them all the powers and deterrents in Part IV of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving amendment No. 169 and the Minister having replied to the group of amendments being taken together, I have the advantage of the Minister having retaliated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's logic here is not only imperfect but, I contend, grossly distorted. In planning matters, circumstances prevail in which a local authority, is the planning authority.  Over <Col N="32" /> and above that there is the appeals procedure to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>We are faced here with circumstances in which the Minister is creating a new licensing procedure which could severely delay or have an impact on the planning procedures.  There is at present the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991, whose provisions purport to reduce the overall duration of a planning appeal.  At the same time we are dealing with this Bill &mdash; and some planning permissions may be conditional on a licence being granted under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; so that the length of time it may take to be granted a licence under the provisions of this Bill could retard planning permissions.  I contend it also creates a bureaucratic planning nightmare.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants integrated planning and pollution control to run parallel, she should allow local authorities be the licensees subject to appeal to the proposed Environmental Protection Agency.  If that Environmental Protection Agency is to be the court of first resort rather than that of last resort in environmental and pollution licensing matters, what recourse is available to those dissatisfied with decisions of the Environmental Protection Agency?  The answer is they must go to court.  Of their very nature court cases can take a considerable length of time.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister has got this all wrong.  Many people who strongly support the concept of an Environmental Protection Agency, who are strongly in favour of clear-cut, energetic protection of our environment, are greatly concerned with provisions in this Part of the Bill because they do not integrate.  The Minister has been speaking about integration of pollution controls.  Environmental control matters are not integrated with the planning process.  Rather they are in addition to, and almost certainly, are completely at variance with the objectives of the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, which had its Second Reading in this House.</P>
    <P>Nothing the Minister has said in <Col N="33" /> defence of the present provisions gets over that fact.  The Minister indicated that the local authorities do not have the necessary staff.  I believe that in general local authorities have the staff: some may not have the staff and they will have to get them in the same way as the Environmental Protection Agency will have to get them.  If people are dissatisfied with the decisions of a local authority they should be able to appeal to the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is very clear that people would prefer that course of action rather than having to appeal in the courts.  We could end up in a situation where many pollution control issues may not be decided by experts in the Environmental Protection Agency in the final analysis but be decided by judges in court who are not trained in environmental matters.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had a very thorough debate on the type of people who should be appointed to the board of the agency. We spoke about people with training in biology, engineering, etc.  Of course, it is absolutely correct that the Environmental Protection Agency should have that sort of expertise which is very relevant to understanding the scientific solutions to environmental problems.  Even though she does not say so, what the Minister is proposing in Part IV is that the ultimate arbiter in environmental matters should be the courts.  If the Environmental Protection Agency either grant a licence which makes a number of people unhappy, or refuse a licence to an applicant, it seems that there will be frequent recourse to the High Court to set aside the decision of the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is fundamental to democracy that there is some form of appeal against a decision; one cannot have an arbitrary decision.  The Minister has argued that she is creating a decisive Environmental Protection Agency who will have teeth.  However, I believe she is almost certainly creating an agency who will have many of their decisions reviewed and probably set aside by the courts who may be experts in law but who are not and cannot be experts in environmental matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> For this reason I ask the Minister to reconsider the provisions in Part IV which are seen as the central weakness in the Bill.  The Minister's proposals will almost certainly add to delay in planning procedures in the case of most major planning applications; it will retard development.  Even worse, it will make the courts and not the Environmental Protection Agency the final arbiter in so far as pollution control is concerned.  If the Minister is not satisfied that we should designate such power to sanitary authorities &mdash; she said there were a total of 80 &mdash; she may consider accepting an amendment on Report Stage which will make the county councils and the county borougns responsible for such matters. She may argue that the remit of a sanitary authority extends into the smaller local authority areas.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has not been forthcoming in regard to the many amendments put down by Deputy Carey, Deputy Allen and myself to this part of the Bill.  She was forthcoming on other sections of the Bill and I am very disappointed that she has not accepted our amendments.  I expected her to accept that the proosals in Part IV will add to the difficulties experienced in getting development, helping new companies to start up, helping existing companies to develop and creating employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have thought long and hard about the impact of all these amendments. I did not table an amendment along the lines of the amendments put down by my Fine Gael colleagues because quite frankly I am convinced that, on balance, the Minister's proposals are sound.  I do not want to give too much credit to the Minister in relation to this entire issue because I think section 80 is based substantially on section 6 of the UK Environmental Protection Act, 1990, which introduced the concept of integrated pollution control.  That Act has been in existence in the UK for the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously those of us who have served on local authorities in particular have <Col N="35" /> a hankering to support the notion that decisions should be made at that level. Yesterday I argued trenchantly about the need for local authority members to have an input into the advisory committee. By and large, local authorities have a creditable record in regard to pollution control.  Without being smug, I want to say that I come from a county which has an exemplary record in this regard; Wexford County Council have a record of which anyone could be proud.</P>
    <P>We are being asked here to fundamentally alter the impact of the Bill. What we are about here is establishing an Environmental Protection Agency who have teeth.  Our objective is to ensure that there is pollution control and that we improve and protect the environment. The arguments in relation to planning and development are a sideline issue which obviously must be taken into account but which are not at the core of what we are about: what we are about here is the establishment of mechanisms to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>I am willing to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt.  I believe she will establish an Environmental Protection Agency who will have the necessary resources, expertise and wherewithal to actually monitor on a standardised basis all developments throughout the country. It would be invidious if we allowed a differentiation of standards to occur when increasing joblessness puts pressure on every local authority to look favourably at any development.  It may well happen that one local authority will be set up against another in terms of their standards.  For example, they could be told, &ldquo;We can get a better deal in another country or another part of the country; they are less rigid in the way they interpret pollution controls&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our objective here is to establish a national authority, national standards and to protect the environment.  Quite frankly, local authorities do not have the resources to do this job.  For example, many local authorities do not have any equipment with which to monitor noise pollution.  Many local authorities do not <Col N="36" /> have the necessary personnel to monitor the waterways in their areas of operation. There has been an embargo on recruitment of officers to local authorities for a number of years.  Local authorities are now at the pin of their collar to carry out the statutory functions which are developed on them by Statute from this House.  They do not have the wherewithal, the resources, funding or personnel, to deal with all the implications of this legislation, nor could they be expected to.  If a local authority had to deal with one application in a decade they would not have the expertise, resources or skilled personnel to give it the type of analysis it would merit.</P>
    <P>As I said, I have great faith in local authorities.  They have done a tremendously positive job in many parts of the country.  While unfortunately there are some exceptions to this, these are very few.  What we are about here now is establishing a completely new and different body; we are proposing to establish on a national basis an Environmental Protection Agency who will have an integrated pollution plan.  I hope that the Minister's commitment will bear fruit and that we will have a national organisation with teeth and resources.  Once the agency are established we will have to ensure in future years that this is what happens.</P>
    <P>I am afraid our experience of another body, An Bord Pleanála, does not often fill us with great confidence. Quite often decisions made by a local authority for the best environmental reasons have been overturned by the national planning body, An Bord Pleanála.  Very often there is no rhyme, reason nor logic to it and no mechanism by which it can be queried except by taking a point of law to the High Court.  I am concerned by the point raised by Deputy Jim Mitchell in relation to an appeals mechanism.  There must be a clear appeals mechanism through a system which allows proper evaluation of the merits of an appeal to be taken into account.  I hope the Minister will address that point in particular <Col N="37" /> so that she can convince me she is on the right path.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Jim Mitchell's proposal.  It is ironic that we spent an hour this morning debating problems which will arise in future and yet we are trying to centralise things more and more.  In the reply which the Minister gave to the amendment tabled in the names of Deputies Jim Mitchell, Allen and myself, she favoured further centralisation of environmental control which flies in the face of all the principles her Government advocate at present. They are really concerned about subsidiarity and that is difficult to understand. I am sure, a Chathaoirleach, that you have had long experience of planning applications for new industries in the Cork region, especially in relation to Cork harbour.  Many of the problems which existed before setting up that industry certainly would not have been resolved if Cork County Council, the objectors and the promoters had to travel to Dublin every week to a centralised office to meet the champions of the environmental cause who had another extreme view in regard to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister, far from giving the agency teeth, introduced a Bill which will cause environmental and planning constipation, although that is probably not what she intended.  She has ignored the practical experience at local authority level; it could mean that jobs will be lost as no one will come to outlying areas because funds will not be available.  The Bill seems to favour the siting of sensitive environmental proposals in the city of Dublin and its environs.  Local interests should not be ignored and if the problems in relation to local planning authorities cannot be addressed, as proposed in our amendment, there will not be the great new dawn which the Minister expects from the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency the IDA and SFADCo proposed siting a very substantial industry which would have provided 500 or 600 jobs at Shannon Airport for the Beecham International Corporation. <Col N="38" /> As a result of a mix-up between the IDA and SFADCo the industry was located in Scotland.  Part of the problem arose because the people advising the IDA were in Dublin.  Their message was totally different from the message received in our area.  A volume of opposition to the industry grew.  Sadly it was lost to my constituency as a result of the bureaucratic set-up and the remoteness of people operating in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is need for the Environmental Protection Agency to have an immediate involvement with the local planning authorities so that there will not be delays and frustrations.  We do not want companies from overseas finding that the whole system militates against their proposals, for the wrong reasons.  I am disappointed with the Minister's response to these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to respond to Deputy Carey's speech.  He mentioned the word &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;.  The definition of &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo; is that decisions are made at the lowest effective level, not at the lowest level.  We must be very clear about this because no party or person in this House is more dedicated to the principle of decision-making at local level, where it is appropriate, than ours. There are many areas, particularly in regard to this Bill, where it is not appropriate for the local authorities to make a decision.  For example, there could be a proposal to site a factory within one quarter of a mile of a county border; local authority borders are fixed and set and it is obvious, if the project is a major chemical industry, that there may be pollution problems.  It would be totally inappropriate and wrong that the county in which the industry is proposed to be sited should have sole control over whether the industry gets a licence as the potential pollution may spread a few yards into the next county or even further, perhaps over other counties, indeed perhaps over the whole country.  It is very important to set down a marker in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to Deputy Howlin, I have no doubt that, on balance, the Minister is going down the right road on this <Col N="39" /> issue.  It is very hard for us to centralise things, we are very much against centralisation but, unfortunately, in some cases it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred to the loss of an industry in his area, I should not like to comment as I do not know the details. However, it is generally recognised that we are very easy in regard to these issues. Many countries have much stronger environmental laws and longer time lags. People get the impression here that we are frightening away industry, that may be so but other countries are frightening them away much more quickly than we are.  Deputy Carey said an industry proposed for his area eventually went to Scotland.  Much of the industry which we rightly rejected here has gone to the Third World countries.  Of course we do not want to offload our problems on the Third World but I am afraid that brings in a wider issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin talked about the chances of the agency getting sufficient funds and I expect there will be considerable problems in that regard. However, I would hate to think that each local authority would have to appeal to the Minister for the Environment for adequate funds to deal with the issue of licences.  They will have more than enough to do in monitoring without issuing licences.  This could be the great copout by the Government and the local authorities, the buck could be passed from one to the other.  At least in this case we are quite clear in regard to where the resources will have to come from.  We are clear that the resources will have to come from the Environmental Protection Agency who, in turn, will get them from the Government.  We may talk about the provisions of the Bill and so on but at the end of the day it will come down to money and the resources the Government will make available to the agency.  Unfortunately, we cannot address this question in the Bill; it will have to be addressed afterwards.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about one aspect of the Minister's proposal on the right of appeal and perhaps she might comment on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> The only way a person can exercise his or her right of appeal under the section is through the courts.  Lawyers are doing well enough and are we going to generate more work for which they can charge exorbitant fees.  I accept the Fine Gael view on that.  I am not quite sure of the best approach to this, we may need a body to arbitrate on appeals.  However, the courts are not the ideal answer.  I intend to give this matter further thought and I may table an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>All Deputies are being reasonable in regard to this matter.  I accept Deputy Mitchell's point that it is not desirable to extend these provisions to the sanitary authorities.  That would be wholly undesirable because of the duplication of work, as there are 87 sanitary authorities compared with 33 planning authorities.  As the Deputy was reasonable I am not going to dwell on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputies Carey and Garland let me say that I support the principle of subsidiarity but there is often confusion that this means that decisions are made at the lowest level regardless of the consequences.  Subsidiarity takes into account the most effective unit for making decisions whether it is at parish, town or county level.  That is important. Among the industries covered in the First Schedule are the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, power stations, food industries, meat factories, intensive agricultural operations, the processing of asbestos and the manufacture and processing asbestos based products, the extraction, production and processing of raw asbestos, the extraction of aluminium oxide from ore.  We are talking about technically difficult processes and there is no question but that the most effective way to license these activities in a small country is centrally.  I will list some of the countries where licences are granted by a central body.  They span the political spectrum from socialism and left wing politics right across to the right.  In France, Norway and Denmark licences are issued by a central body and since the <Col N="41" /> recent Act which Deputy Howlin referred to, licences are issued by a central body in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to be arrogant when I say that details of our integrated pollution control licence system and the role of the agency in this matter was published by the Government in December 1989 in advance of the publication of the UK Bill.  What prompted us to take this road were the developments at European Community level &mdash; although these are by no means finalised &mdash; an integrated pollution controls and the experience on the ground.</P>
    <P>Many representatives of Irish industry, most of whom conduct their affairs in a way that is not at variance with the highest environmental standards, have said to me that it does not matter what standards are applied as long as they are enforced in the same way across the board.  Several cases were brought to my attention of applicants in one county having to comply with a specific set of conditions that were not applied by the licensing authority in another county. Being realistic, that is not desirable in a small country like this, either from the point of view of existing Irish industry or overseas industry that might locate here. We do not want people to be checking out the areas where they are most likely to get away with breaches of the pollution Acts.  That would be undesirable from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>While we are on section 80, we are dealing with the granting of licences and the appeals procedure together.  This is understandable because it is very hard to separate one from the other.  I spent much time trying to think of ways we could make provision for third party appeals because this concept was accepted in environmental matters, particularly planning matters.  The right of a third party appeal is very fundamental to our legislation.  We would be reluctant to reduce in any way, or remove those rights.  However, I have to balance that view with the fact that we are now establishing a new agency which will be independent of local authorities, the Government and industry and which will <Col N="42" /> operate independently.  It is an offence under the Act to seek to improperly influence the agency and so on.  As we are establishing an agency comprised of experts of the highest credibility it would be wrong to provide that the agency may grant licences but that some other body will have the power to overturn their decisions on appeal.  I do not know what other body would be suitable.</P>
    <P>At present when a chemical or pharmaceutical plant apply to the local authority for a licence, the local authority in almost all cases recruit the services of outside consultants, because they do not have the expertise to assess the application. An Bord Pleanála do something similar.  The most recent example was the application by the Sandoz pharmaceutical company in Cork.  When they appealed the planning decision, An Bord Pleanála had to recruit an outside private consultancy to help them deal with the application because they did not have the resources.</P>
    <P>I make an important point because as no other body in the country has the kind of know-how and resources to deal with the appeal we provided in section 83 for a very open process in the case of appeals. It is very different from anything we had before.  Within two months of the application being made, local authorities and other interested parties are informed of the agency's thinking and then the applicant or objectors have a right to make submissions outlining the grounds for their objections.  That is fair but I know Deputies have tabled amendments to it and I will deal with them later.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, given that we do not have this expertise anywhere else and that we cannot set up yet another body to deal with appeals, we have adopted a very open approach.  Many people have complimented me on the fact that they will know before any decision is made the agency's thinking so that they can influence that thinking at the primary stage.</P>
    <P>Between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of appeals to An Bord Pleanála are refused on appeal.  There is no procedure for appealing against the granting of a <Col N="43" /> waste licence and as far as I understand no licence under the Air Pollution Act has been refused on appeal and only 15 per cent of licences under the Water Pollution Act have been refused on appeal. The reason licences generally are not refused on appeal is that by granting a licence, the authority can set down the conditions to make whatever they want happen.  They may place very stringent controls on the applicant to prevent pollution of the atmosphere, water or whatever. The granting of a licence gives the licensing authority enormous power to impose very stringent conditions.  In some cases this may mean that the applicant does not proceed with the project because it may well be felt that the conditions are too tough or expensive to comply with.  This is a possibility when licensing authorities have enormous powers.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the debate has dwelt on the fact that many Deputies believe &mdash; I know that Deputy Mitchell believes this also &mdash; that the licensing of the activity should be dealt with at the same time as the planning application.  That assumes that the agency will only be dealing with new activities &mdash; I know Deputy Howlin has tabled an amendment to this. When the agency is up and running in about one year its major function will not be to deal with new activities, because I do not anticipate that we will have a flood of new industrial development at such a rate that the agency will never be able to turn to existing activities.  When the agency have been in place for some time the existing activities will be the core of their work.  They will license established activities and planning will not arise.  That is why it is not desirable nor do I believe it is necessary to link planning and licensing together.  Many people feel they are part of the same coin but they are not.  Naturally the building of a facility and the planning conditions which apply have an environmental impact from a visual point of view; all buildings have an impact one way or the other, but it is a very different procedure.  The people who deal with planning are different from those who <Col N="44" /> deal with licensing.  People who deal with planning are essentially planners, architects, engineers and so on; the people who deal with licensing have very specialised scientific qualification.  Even within the local authority structure there are different people who have nothing to do with the planning process.  At present the procedures are separate.</P>
    <P>A person does not have to apply for the licence and for planning permission at the same time but we will deal with that later.  I have given some thought to that.  Should the two come together? Should the applicant have to apply to the local authority and to the agency for the licence?  I have decided on balance it is better to separate them.  The licence will require more work on behalf of the applicant. An applicant may decide to see if he will get planning permission before deciding to apply for a licence.  It is possible that somebody could be refused a licence and be granted planning permission, or <i>vice versa.</i> That is not incompatible. A building could be acceptable in an area but the activities that require a licence may not be acceptable for the building or for the area and <i>vice versa.</i> It is important that we do not tie the two procedures together because they are separate and different, even if they are concerned about the environment.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted &mdash; and Deputy Howlin drew attention to this &mdash; in countries with greater resources than ours that if we want to impose very stringent licence controls on particular activities which, if something goes wrong, can pollute and cause danger not merely to the environment but to public health, that require technical expertise and equipment to monitor conditions and if we want to have the highest possible standards in place and enforce against those activities outlined in the First Schedule, then the most appropriate way to do that is to give this new body the necessary resources and teeth.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments against giving teeth to the agency &mdash; not by any Member of this House but by some people outside &mdash; was that they did not want an agency which would be drawn into controversy <Col N="45" /> or that had to grant a licence for something that may not be popular.  Anybody who has to make decisions has to make unpopular decisions.  I could not envisage an agency always being popular unless it was a toothless agency.  Naturally you would always be popular if you just made recommendations or if you were drawing up state of the environment reports, giving advice or consulting people. Anyone who does only that would possibly always be popular because he would be passing the buck and letting somebody else make the decisions.  Anybody who has a decision making role sometime has to make decisions that may not be universally popular.  Because we want to keep the agency popular it is not a good enough reason to remove this power from them; it is far more important that the right people make the decisions rather than that we simply have an agency that may be popular but would have no teeth.</P>
    <P>We are still dealing with section 80 and I am sure Deputies are anxious to move on to the specifics of the other sections. On balance it would be wrong to remove this power from the agency.  Without it the body would be toothless and would merely be a consultative advisory body. At the end of the day, the people want to know that decisions will be made on activities which cause pollution.  Where nothing happens no pollution can occur. When you put in place certain activities, the threat of pollution occurs.  If we do not give this power to the agency, they will not have public credibility; they will not be seen to be doing the job and they will not be justified in getting large resources.  We do not have the option and we do not have the resources to give to the 33 different local authorities because what we are talking about is very expensive equipment and personnel.  At our stage of development we could not justify that.</P>

      <P>I am not persuaded by any of the points made by the Minister. I do not disagree with her for one minute or with Deputy Garland or Deputy Howlin on the need for this agency to have teeth.  There is concern on all sides <Col N="46" /> of this House to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency are effective in improving the environment whether it be water, sea, air or the visual environment. We are not at odds on that point we are at odds with the idea that Dublin knows best.</P>

      <P>In many cases decisions are centralised in Dublin and a fiasco ensues.  Even in the social welfare area, decisions are made in Dublin about disability benefit or deserted wife's benefit; removed from local knowledge this practice is a fiasco.  There is a number of problems with the proposals in this part of the Bill.  Effectively we are dealing with sections 80 to 98, inclusive.  The first problem is that this Bill may be unconstitutional if there is no right of appeal against a decision about a licence, by the applicant or by a third party, and I would like the Minister to reflect on that point. If the law was contested and overthrown in the court on the basis that there was no provision for an appeal, what would be the position of the Environmental Protection Agency?  If there is a right of appeal, but only to the courts, the Bill would be defective.  What about the small man and the Mr. Hanrahans of this world who do not have the resources to go to the courts but who are affected by pollution caused by a neighbour?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about somebody who is unemployed or on a pension and is seriously affected by such pollution?  If that person does not have the resources to go to court will legal aid be provided for appeals?  Is the Minister not doing away with the rights of ordinary people who do not have the resources to go to court?  Has the Minister not considered the rights of the small person?  Even if appeals to the court do not arise, what <Col N="47" /> rights do individuals or communities have for an oral hearing by the Environmental Protection Agency?</P>
      <P>According to the provisions in the sections before us they have no rights.  In the legislation which established planning procedures and An Bord Pleanála, we know An Bord Pleanála have teeth even though initial planning decisions are taken at local level.  An Bord Pleanála can receive a delegation at an oral hearing or can refuse to have an oral hearing. What is more, An Bord Pleanála can make a decision which is in breach of the local authority's development plan &mdash; this power is greater than the power the county manager has.  Indeed, three-quarters of the elected representatives must agree that permission can be granted, not three-quarters of those present but three-quarters of the total.  Yet, An Bord Pleanála have the teeth and power to overrule a decision and grant planning permission in breach of the local authority's development plan.</P>
      <P>No one would argue, therefore, that An Bord Pleanála do not have teeth given that most planning decisions are made and finalised at local level.  Likewise, I would argue that it would be much more appropriate, in the interests of subsidiarity, to have decisions made at the point nearest to people, to give local people an effective say in relation to local matters relating to the environment, given their local knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me on to my next argument about this part of the Bill.  Not only is it at cross purposes with planning legislation but also with the Local Government Act which was enacted last year. That legislation was paraded by the Government with great ballyhoo as reforming legislation to give local authorities a major role in all these matters. However in practice we know that this is not the case because the Custom House still controls the purse strings and while in theory the local authorities have a number of possible roles under the Local Government Act they cannot fulfil them because the fund raising power has not been given and they still have to get permission <Col N="48" /> for specific projects from the Custom House.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the objective of the Local Government Act was to restore decision making powers to the point closest to local communities.  However, this Bill seeks to restore powers to Dublin again and remove the right of individuals and communities to have any direct say at local level, or any leverage over those they elect to local government to have decisions they feel are warranted &mdash; given their local knowledge &mdash; made.  Furthermore, we are going to make it virtually impossible for them to appeal to the courts unless they have massive financial resources.  The Bill, therefore, is ill-considered.</P>
    <P>I want to make Fine Gael's position clear.  Deputy Garland adverted to industries which were diverted to the Third World.  I wish to make the point that neither I nor Fine Gael want dirty industry in this country.  What is more, I do not believe that enlightened industries or, indeed, the vast majority of industries, want lax environmental standards. What they do want are clear-cut standards so that they would know in advance what would be required, and an efficient decision making system.</P>
    <P>Let us take as an example a company who proposes to locate in Europe and are looking at Ireland, Scotland and Switzerland. No one would argue that there are lax environmental controls in Switzerland. Indeed it will be demonstrated to those investors that the systems in operation there in relation to planning and environmental control have been streamlined and dovetailed and that a clear decision would be made speedily on all aspects of the matter, say, within three months.  However, we have a planning system, a planning appeals system, building regulations and a building regulations appeals system.  I should say that while an attempt was made in recent legislation to dovetail those two latter aspects, as they needed to be dovetailed, no attempt is being made in this legislation to dovetail the planning and appeals.  For example, no time limits within which a decision would have to be made have <Col N="49" /> been laid down.  This is a grave mistake. Inevitably, this is going to lead to appeals to the court by those who have the resources &mdash; this usually means industry rather than individuals.  However, given the long list of court cases unfortunately decisions will be delayed.  When prospective investors are informed of this they will be put off.  This is yet another reason companies will not invest in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Recently I spent ten days in the United States of America with the Lord Mayor when I visited the sister city of Dublin, San Jose, other cities in California and Silicon Valley.  It was made absolutely clear to us that industries now expect the most stringent environmental standards and they have no problem with this but what they need is clarity and a timescale within which decisions will be made.</P>
    <P>This is the one part of the Bill which will destroy its effectiveness and weaken the strong momentum in favour of improving the environment.  I urge the Minister of State, therefore, to see the folly of what is being proposed.  The Environmental Protection Agency should not be a licensing authority of first resort and if they are there will have to be an appeals procedure if it is to be constitutional.  If an appeal is made it will be made to the courts and will prove to be costly.  If it proves to be costly ordinary people will be eliminated and there will be long delays and uncertainty.  In addition, it will not be the environmental experts who will make the final decision but rather the lawyers.  I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider her stance in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by Deputy Mitchell's arguments.  While there is no question about the need for clarity in relation to environmental protection, devolving power to the planning authorities, much less to the sanitary authorities, to grant licences is not the way to give a clear signal to any potential industry that we have clear standards because what we would have would be different standards in different parts of the country where one applies for a <Col N="50" /> licence.  What we are seeking are the most stringent standards for Ireland to protect the country.</P>
      <P>Ireland is unique in the European Community in that it has the advantage of not having had to put up with mass pollution caused by the industries we are judging.  We have that advantage and we should protect and garner it for ourselves. I am minded, therefore, to support the concept of an integrated pollution control system and the mechanism which has been put forward by the Minister of State in the Bill.  It is an essential part of the Bill and if we were to go any other route we would take from the Bill one of its most important strengths.</P>
      <P>I do this on the understanding &mdash; this is an act of faith in the Minister of State &mdash; that the Minister of State will provide the necessary resources for the agency. She has indicated all along that she will do so.  Without this back-up, support and resources the agency will be toothless; even with the appeals mechanism proposed by Fine Gael it would still be toothless.</P>
      <P>While I support the principle put forward by the Minister of State a number of issues arise.  Let me comment briefly on one of the points made by Deputy Mitchell.  I do not support the principle that &ldquo;Dublin knows best&rdquo;.  I should say now that it is essential that this agency are not located in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but rather in a part of the country that is green and clean and which has expertise in this area.  While I make a strong case in favour of the part of the country that I happen to represent &mdash; it would be eminently suitable &mdash; the principle of centralisation in relation to this issue is a worthy one because I do not believe any local authority have either the resources or the desire to make decisions of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give one instance in relation to the first activity I was ever involved in before I thought of standing for public office.  In the late seventies the ESB <Col N="51" /> applied to Wexford County Council for planning permission to build a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point.  As the county manager and the members of Wexford County Council would admit, they did not have the competence to evaluate what effect or impact a nuclear power station would have on the environment. It was beyond the competence and resources of a local authority to make a proper evaluation.  It would be inconceivable for us to ask every local or planning authority to equip themselves to make that sort of decision.  On this issue, we need standards and clear signals.  We need to have it clearly put to any potential investor that a high standard is demanded but that it will be consistent, fair and understood in advance.  There will be many areas in the world which will attract industry with lax standards.  However, the European Community will demand and have the highest standards.  Green industries will be the industries of the future.  A country like us, dependent on the food industry and our image of greenness, should build green industries in a green environment.  We must protect our environment at all costs.  That is what we are about in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State raised a number of issues about which I want clarification. There are a number of inconsistencies in the legislation.  In relation to the requirement to submit an environmental impact statement with an application for a licence, it is not written into the legislation. Perhaps the Minister will address that.  It is often necessary for an applicant to submit an environmental impact statement to a planning authority but, as the Minister pointed out, the planning process and the licensing process under this Bill are distinct and separate.  If the Bill is passed as it stands the planning authority will not be in a position to make any recommendations or conditions in relation to pollution control.  It is important to include in the Bill a requirement for an environmental impact statement as part of a licensing application to the agency.  It might well be in breach of the 1985 EC Directive on environmental <Col N="52" /> impact statements if that was not the case.  I understand that the Government are already in trouble in relation to that Directive, and that a letter has already come from the Commission formally complaining about the carrying out of EC Directives.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, my amendments, Nos. 152 to 156 which related to the previous section and which would have addressed this issue, were not reached. It is important for the Minister to clarify the necessity for environmental impact statements as an integral part of the licensing procedure as opposed to the planning procedure which is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to address the interfacing between the planning application and the licensing application, because it is very unclear.  Under section 82 (4) co-operation between the agency and the local authority is quite inadequate. We have to look again at how they interface in relation to processing two aspects of the same application, one for planning permission and one for a licence.  For instance, will there be two oral hearings, one for planning aspects and one for environmental impact aspects?  That would be wasteful duplication and my amendment No. 197 would address this issue.  The interface between the two mechanisms to grant planning permission and to grant a licence needs to be clarified as it will cause great confusion in local authorities in their attempts to deal with them separately.</P>
    <P>In relation to the granting of licences generally, there does not seem to be any time limit for the granting of licences. This runs counter to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991 in which we are trying to put clearly designated time frames within which planning applications should be processed. It is wrong that no such time frame is incorporated in relation to the granting of licences.  Perhaps the Minister intends introducing this by way of regulations. That is another point on which I seek clarification from the Minister.  This is a very important section and I am anxious to deal with a number of amendments <Col N="53" /> to it.  We have fairly well exhausted the argument in relation to the merits of the agency or the local authority processing the licence in the first instance.  I am convinced that the Minister is going about it in the right way, but I am not convinced that there is clarity in relation to the way it will operate.  I hope the points I have raised will be addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Mitchell, I would assure him that no one in this country wants unnecessary bureaucracy to stand between this country and another industry.  Sometimes applications take time.  It is a question of achieving a balance between making a hasty decision which we and future generations will live to regret and unnecessary bureaucratic delay.  Sufficient resources should be available at all times to deal with these matters on an efficient basis.  Applications should not be put on a long list so that when they get to the top of the list it is found that there is nothing wrong with the application but that by that time the bird has flown.  It is a question of resources.</P>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Mitchell has said and I know that Fine Gael, like all the other parties in the House, are totally dedicated to the environment.  Deputy Mitchell shows a touching faith and a naivety about international industry.  Let there not be any mistake about it, multinational companies are seeking the lowest possible environmental standards. Let us not be in any doubt about it.  We have only to look at what Union Carbide did in Bhopal in India a few years ago, where people are still dying as a result of the emissions there.  Thousands have died and unfortunately thousands more will die.  Let us be under no illusion about international companies.  Some are good, some are bad and some are very bad and are only concerned with making profits. They are not concerned about the well-being of the people in the areas in which they set up, or about the long term consequences to the environment.  We must never forget that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what I said earlier applies here but I will deal specifically with a number of points raised by Deputy Mitchell who was quite insistent that the local authorities should be the licensing authority for the activities specified in the First Schedule.  I cannot accept that.  It is neither desirable, practical nor effective in a small country like ours to give to the 33 planning authorities the kind of resources that would allow them to be equipped to deal with what we are talking about here.  Most local authorities have to recruit the services of outside private consultants and they are effectively the people who set the conditions as far as local authorities and An Bord Pleanála are concerned.  Neither the board nor the local authorities have the people to deal with some complicated and technical processes. I mentioned the recent Sandoz application where such a body had to be called in by the board.  It would be irresponsible of us, when establishing a new agency which we want to have the kind of experts we need and the resources required, not to give them what is needed in this country.  It would be grossly irresponsible to move away from that decision, even if it is unpopular with some members of local authorities.  The position would then be as it is now, with different conditions applying in different local authority areas because of differences in interpretation or because different people are called in to assist with the licence.  That is not satisfactory. I do not want to see people trawling around Ireland seeking a location where the standards imposed might be somewhat lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said that it would be unconstitutional if there were not a formalised appeals procedure as provided for in the Planning Acts.  I am advised by the Attorney General that there are no constitutional or legal problems as regards the procedure proposed in this Bill.  It would not be possible to have a different body.  I can think of no better independent expert body than the Environmental Protection Agency.  Litigation on foot of decisions made by the Environmental Protection Agency will <Col N="55" /> have to be on points of law.  Every citizen is entitled to take a case on points of law. A decision by the agency to grant or not to grant a licence will not be open to appeal through the courts.  Appeal can only be made on points of law and this applies in respect of all legislation.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have a dual role. They are the guardians of our environment in the main.  The vast bulk of environmental protection legislation is implemented and enforced on the ground by local authorities.  They will remain, after the establishment of the agency, the main enforcing authority.  The agency will have a supervisory role over local authorities in relation to the implementation of environmental protection powers.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are also development authorities and the recent relaxation of the <i>ultra vires</i> rule gives them more powers in that regard.  Conflicts often arise on the ground where locally elected members are drawn into debate whether they should allow a particular activity that will generate employment or maintain high environmental standards. Invariably in that kind of debate the environment loses out.  Environmental concerns are swept aside as people are carried away with the notion that we can have jobs at any cost.  Because of the dual role of local authorities, it is not always desirable that they should be decision-making bodies.  It is a function of elected members to direct a manager to grant permission for a particular activity if they so wish, under a restricted section 4 mechanism.  It is appropriate that we should take away from local authorities the function of granting licences in respect of major enterprises which have the potential to cause pollution and give that function to a totally independent, expert body.</P>
    <P>When this system is operational it will be seen by the public as most appropriate. Many members of the public are not necessarily concerned about objecting to a particular activity.  They are often more concerned with ensuring that the activity is carried on to the highest possible <Col N="56" /> environmental standards so that if something goes wrong their health and their environment will not be placed at risk.  They want to know that the body enforcing the standards and the controls has the expertise and the clout to protect them.  The public have the right to expect that and anything less from the Environmental Protection Agency would make it a toothless advisory and consultative body.  An Foras Forbartha did outstanding work in relation to the environment but they were not operationally independent from the Department and did not have any teeth in relation to making decisions.  Their work was nevertheless invaluable to the Minister, the Department and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not have the clout to allow them to make decisions. That was one of the weaknesses in the structure.  If we were to remove this central core power from the agency we would turn it into an advisory and consultative body.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin said that we in Ireland want green companies with high environmental standards.  I totally agree.  I often thought that only idealistic environmentalists felt that jobs would be created in the future because of the environment, but I was pleased recently to note the Culliton report, which has been acknowledged as the most radical review of industrial policy, stated that it could be in the interests of our economy to strive for the highest possible environmental standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sectors of the economy which have the greatest potential to create jobs are agriculture, food and tourism.  We can achieve premium markets abroad if we protect our clean, green image.  Environmental considerations are an important factor in gaining entry to the premium markets in the Community and the world at large.  Tourism is a labour-intensive sector which has greater potential.  Tourists will not come to Ireland for the Torremolinos-type of holiday.  They will <Col N="57" /> come for golf or fishing or to walk and tour areas of outstanding beauty.  They are attracted by the environment which has so much to offer.  There is often an assumption that there is a need to strike a balance between a certain amount of pollution and a certain number of jobs. In future it will be jobs because of the environment rather than pollution because of jobs.</P>
    <P>I want to refute Deputy Mitchell's suggestion that Dublin knows best.  The assumption is that if a structure is centrally organised the people making decisions do not know what they are talking about.  Although this body will have a central national headquarters, it will also be located in the regions.  It will be decentralised since it will need people on the ground to monitor and enforce.</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin made a point relating to the Planning Bill.  There is no time limit in this Bill on the making of a decision about a licence.  After two months the agency will be required to make known their thinking about the licence, but when comments or objections are received the agency are not required to make a decision within a specific time.  If we are seeking to expedite the decision-making process and we are in the process of passing a Planning Bill, it is desirable that we should not, while speeding up planning, have further delays in the licensing procedure.  I thought of introducing an amendment at this point but on reflection, since this legislation will be passed before the Planning Bill, I think it is better to leave a decision in relation to the time period for discussion under the Planning Bill.  It is the intention to introduce the same limits to the licensing procedure that apply in the planning legislation.  Everybody acknowledges that we do not have to delay making decisions in order to make the right decisions.  Once the resources and the people are available we will be able to make the decisions much more speedily than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> Deputy Howlin asked about the environmental impact assessment procedure. I agree with the Deputy, and provision will be made in regulations for those activities requiring an environmental impact assessment procedure.  To the best of my knowledge, that is provided for in the First Schedule to the Bill. Obviously the agency will have to receive a copy of the environmental impact assessment procedure as will the planning authority.  The one environmental impact study will suffice for the agency and the planning authority but what will be required &mdash; we will be providing for this very clearly &mdash; is that the agency will make decisions relating to environmental pollution and the planning authority will make decisions on planning matters. Obviously, it is desirable that there be no duplication or confusion which would lead to litigation.  Therefore, it will be clearly defined that the agency will make decisions in relation to environmental pollution matters and the planning authority will make decisions on planning matters.</P>
    <P>We must realise that any Minister for the Environment will find it much easier to get the resources required to properly fund this agency &mdash; that is certainly my intention and that of the Government &mdash; if the agency have teeth, power and clout and carry out licensing activities rather than being another advisory consultative body.  With respect to such bodies, as most Deputies know, bodies that do not have clout to make decisions rarely have the muscle needed to get resources. When times are difficult and there are competing interests for resources, invariably it is those bodies with merely a consultative role who are left behind and are starved of resources.  From my point of view and that of any Minister with responsibility for environmental matters regardless of who is in power, it will be much easier to get resources if the agency have a licensing role.</P>
    <P>Because of the role we are giving the agency, they will be able to get licence fees and charge the full cost of monitoring. The taxpayer should not have to <Col N="59" /> subsidise the cost of monitoring activities. If one particular activity has to be monitored more often than another, it will have to pay more.  If a particular activity is the cause of more complaints than another, it will require more monitoring and, therefore, it will cost more. As a result of the procedures in this Bill, it will be in the interests of activities to keep their house in order and to enforce the standards expected of them under the licence.  If they are the cause of nuisance and complaint, they will obviously require more monitoring and more of a hands-on approach by the agency and, therefore, they will be charged a greater fee.  That kind of disincentive will make many activities clean up their act and abide by stringent conditions and controls.</P>
    <P>We have spent quite a long time on this section and I know Deputies have sincerely held views as to the best way forward.  Deputy Mitchell holds one view while Deputies Howlin and Garland hold another, and I share their views.  I believe that if we were to remove these powers from the agency they would have no credibility among the public at large; it would be to the delight of many industrialists, particularly those who have been the cause of complaint, who would see a return to the <i>status quo.</i> Since the concept of this agency was first mooted, and particularly now that it is being brought to final fruition, greater efforts have been made on the part of certain industries to clean up their act and ensure that they operate to the highest possible standards. The reason for that is a fear of the new controls, the new independence and the new clout this agency will have.  It will not be open to anybody to lobby the agency to consider any particular activity more favourably than others.  We all know that happens at present and it will continue to happen if a large number of authorities are responsible in this area and are governed by political persons.  In those circumstances, there will always be the risk that people will be lobbied and that they, in turn, will lobby for a more favourable decision in relation to certain <Col N="60" /> people or activities.  That is undesirable and is not in the interests of the environment or the implementation of high environmental standards in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister has admitted that there will be no appeals procedure, and that reinforces my argument about the constitutionality of this legislation.  Citizens must have an absolute right of appeal, whether they be applicants appealing against a refusal of or excessive conditions attaching to a licence or third parties appealing against a decision they considered was too lax or that the decision was wrong.  There should be a basic appeals procedure.  This legislation is robbing small people who do not have resources of their rights, and that is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister repeated that she wants a body with teeth.  Is she saying An Bord Pleanála have no teeth?  Of course they have.  They are a very powerful body but they do not make the initial decisions.  I cite that one example to dismiss the notion the Minister is implying that if the Environmental Protection Agency were not allowed make licensing decisions they will have no teeth.  They will have a lot of power overseeing general environmental matters as well as the performance of local authorities.  I do not want to make the mistake the Minister made by going on at length because we have agreed a time schedule for these sections. <Col N="61" /> However, I am very disconcerted by the Minister's stance.  It is very clear that the legislation is fundamentally defective and is probably unconstitutional in not providing for an appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>The Minister made much of the idea that people would lobby.  Is it not right that people should have a right to lobby officials or elected representatives if they feel strongly about a licence or planning application?  Is it not democracy that they make their views known and protest? The effect of this Bill, although it is not intended, will be to remove from people any influence they have over their local environment.  The Environmental Protection Agency will make the decisions whether they are located in the sunny south-east&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have made my points on this section so I shall not delay the House in that regard.  One aspect I wish to address is the constitutional question raised by Deputy Jim Mitchell.  I am advised that there is no constitutional right of appeal against an administrative decision but there is a constitutional right of access to the courts.  For that reason, while I am advised at the highest level that there is no problem of the Bill being unconstitutional for not providing an appeals mechanism, it is my contention that there is a real difficulty with section 83 (8) as drafted.  That provision is probably unconstitutional because it provides a fixed period of two months for a judicial review.  The Minister may be aware that Mr. Justice Costello declared a similar section in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 unconstitutional in a case, <i>Brady v. Donegal County Council.</i> That decision was overturned by the Supreme Court on a technicality <Col N="62" /> because the plaintiff had no <i>locus standi.</i> However, I am advised that the validity of the High Court judgment has been upheld.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that aspect carefully.  I suggest, modestly, that my amendment, No. 195, would save the section from being declared unconstitutional.  The Minister should consider accepting that amendment.</P>
      <P>We have debated at length the merits and demerits of where the licensing procedure should start.  I have made my views very clear on that issue and we should make a decison on it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell said An Board Pleanála are not a toothless body and implied that the agency should be an appeal body in relation to licences. However, his amendments seem to seek to give the powers of appeal in relation to licences to An Bord Pleanála rather than to the agency.  In relation to Deputy Howlin's problem with section 83 (8), I shall take advice again before Report Stage.  I shall again consult the Attorney General concerning the time period and the cases referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In page 57, subsection (1), lines 38 and 39, to delete &ldquo;, other than an established activity,'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to alter section 80 (1).  Under the terms of the subsection as drafted existing industries are excluded from the full force of the legislation. Industries that are already polluting should be brought into the net of <Col N="63" /> the legislation.  I know that by way of regulation the Minister seeks to give some room to manoeuvre to industries now causing pollution.  Will the Minister define for the House the time frame she has in mind.  It would be wrong for industries that are up and running to be exempted from the full rigours of this legislation if they are having a negative impact on the environment and are a source of pollution and causing damage not only to the environment but to the inhabitants residing nearby.  While I do not expect the provision to operate on the day after the President signs this Bill into law, it should certainly be operating within an acceptable and reasonable timeframe.  I should like the Minister to outline her views in relation to that issue now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Howlin's amendment.  Throughout the Bill the Minister seems to be creating a two-tier system for industry.  On the one hand, new industries will face the full application of the Bill and the full powers of the Environmental Protection Agency, its licensing procedure and so on.  On the other hand, it appears that there is at best a watered-down application of the terms of the Bill and, in some instances, complete exemption from its provisions for existing industries.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that many of the problems in relation to the environment and those that have prompted opposition to new industry derived from existing industry. For example, the opposition to some of the new projects in the Cork area was motivated primarily by concern that had first arisen in relation to pollution by existing industries.</P>
      <P>The approach by the Minister that creates a two-tier system, with a relatively environmentally strict regime for new industry and a relatively environmentally lax regime for existing industry, is wrong. A greater effort will have to be made to ensure that existing industry, particularly those causing pollution and the principal cause of concern among local communities, are dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put on record, as other speakers have, support for this amendment from Fine Gael.  It is important to provide for the maximum possible local control.  I also wish to stress the importance of introducing a proper appeals procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention that existing industry will be licensed by the agency.  There is no question but that the agency will be the licensing authority for all existing activities covered by the First Schedule.  I agree with Deputies that it would not be acceptable that the agency apply itself only to new activities because, generally speaking, the newer the activity the better its environmental standards.</P>
      <P>If I accepted this amendment every existing activity would become illegal from the prescribed date for the operation of the section.  I do not think that would be the Deputy's intention.  I will examine this and possibly introduce an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties that arises &mdash; which is why it was proposed to be done by way of regulations and orders &mdash; is that it will take some industries longer than others.  For example, in regard to the integrated pollution control licence being discussed at European level, the dates being mentioned in relation to the operation of that licence involve a period as long as 15 years.  I do not anticipate, nor do I wish that all Irish industries included in the First Schedule should have 15 years or anything like that length of time.  We must be practical.  Different dates will be applicable to different sectors. It is desirable that all existing activities be brought within the ambit of the agency's remit within a couple of years. Certainly that is the intention.  But we must do so on a sector by sector approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of older, longer established industries, we must remember we are requiring enormous sums of money to be spent on environmental protection to <Col N="65" /> meet new standards.  We must also realise that a new industry, having been licensed, becomes an existing industry, an established activity.  Therefore, an industry licensed today, last week, or in the last couple of months, from the first day of operation of this agency, would be an established activity even though it may have been licensed under the most modern controls, having high standards enforced on them, the licensing conditions being tough.  It would not be desirable that that industry would necessarily have to be granted a licence initially by the proposed agency.  If their licence had been granted in recent times the chances are it would be one carrying the highest possible standards.  Therefore, there will be many difficulties encountered in applying the provisions of this section to existing activities, to do so in a manner that is fair, affording an industry some time to prepare, to gather resources together, to get their act together, to have the new controls put in place before being granted a licence, before their activities be monitored and controlled by the agency.</P>
    <P>I want to make it abundantly clear that it is my intention to include as many industries nationwide in the First Schedule as is possible, as quickly as possible. After their inception and proper operation the main work of the agency will be in relation to existing activities, relicensing such activities, or licensing some for the first time.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I cannot accept Deputy Howlin's amendment because of its effect in that we could not have circumstances prevail in which everything now licensed would become illegal once the provisions of this section were enacted.  However, if I can, I will return with an amendment in relation to this matter on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the Minister that, when an identical amendment was moved in the Seanad she said she would be happy to look at it on Report Stage in the Seanad.  It has gone through Report Stage in the Seanad and we are on Committee Stage here.  Yet we still do not have an amendment that would fit <Col N="66" /> the Bill.  I accept what the Minister is saying.  I do not envisage circumstances arising in which every industry, on the day the Bill is enacted, would have to have a licence or shut down.  Obviously that would be rather draconian.  Nonetheless, clarity is required in relation to the time span.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the time span in the case of existing industries in the United Kingdom was five years.  She indicated also in the Seanad that she did not envisage the need for such a long time span.  I might refer her to the Official Report of the Seanad proceedings in that respect.  The Minister has not clarified the issue.  I accept the principle of what she says.  On Report Stage, I hope she will return with a specific time span so that we can be confident, as Deputy Gilmore has said, that there will not be a two-tier system in respect of new and existing industries. With that in mind I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to add, after the word &ldquo;activity&rdquo; the following, &ldquo;or arising as a direct consequence of the activity,&rdquo;.  The Bill, as drafted, implies an over-restrictive definition of &ldquo;activity&rdquo;.  It includes only emissions from the activity, whether it is a factory or plant, and does not take account of other emissions into the environment arising as a direct result of such activity and which would not have occurred had such activity not taken place.  An example would be a radiation plant being established where the supply of cobalt 59 to fuel the plant would have significant environmental implications which might not necessarily occur within the vicinity of the plant but nonetheless <Col N="69" /> arise as a direct consequence of the decision to grant a licence to that plant. Another example would be a process resulting in the generation of hazardous waste.  Perhaps the Minister could respond quickly to that point.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the officers he seems to believe have the experience necessary to manage this work do not, in fact, have the necessary skill or training in personnel matters?  Would he consider employing assistance from outside in such matters or sending some of these officers on personal management courses in order to educate them about management at that level.  Does the Minister agree that a culture of command, order and obedience seems to be the order of the day in the Army rather than a concentration on details of personnel and that there is a real need for some type of formal training for the officers concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 83 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the two associations, RACO, representing officers up to and including the ranks of colonel, and PDFORRA, representing NCO's and privates, there have been regular and frequent meetings between the association representatives and representatives, civil and military, of my Department including, where appropriate, representatives of the Department of Finance.  In addition, there has been frequent correspondence and telephone contact between the two sides.  A wide range of issues has been discussed, examples of which are as follows: (a) applications for increased pay; (b) promotion of officers; (c) implementation of various recommendations contained in the report of the Gleeson Commission; and (d) payment of security duty allowance. As a result of such discussions many issues have been resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is an accepted feature of all representation, whether in the public or private sectors, that it is not always practicable for management to concede every proposal or to resolve difficult issues as speedily as association representatives would wish and it may be <Col N="74" /> expected that the Defence Forces will not be an exception in this regard.  Specifically I wish to say that, in the contex of my Department's dealings with the associations generally, there have no been any undue delays in processing the various issues raised.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, I am satisfied the representative arrangements are, generally speaking, developing in a satisfactory manner and I wish to pay tribute both to the RACO and PDFORRA representatives and the departmental representatives, civil and military, for the remarkable progress that has been made since the establishment of the associations in developing the new representative initiative.</P>
    <P>As regards a system of conciliation and arbitration, a process of consultation with both representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, who will be parties to the scheme, is already well under way. Discussions on the terms of the scheme are continuing with each association an a considerable measure of progress have now been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I am sure he will agree that we are not talking about normal industrial relations in the instance.  Does the Minister agree that proper arbitration and conciliation scheme which would lead to better liaison between both groups is necessary?  On occasion there have been long delay between the issuing of letters and the holding of meetings.  Would the Minister not agree it is essential that a proper system is introduced so that both group will know that their negotiations will have positive results?  There should be no delay whatsoever in putting into practice the arrangement which was heralded by all of us in the House as a major break through, in regard to negotiations with the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is very important this entire system should work in as well a lubricated fashion as possible.  I think the Deputy and the House will agree that the <Col N="75" /> arrangement which was put in place a very short time ago has resulted in substantial progress in this area in the meantime. All representative organisations have to find their own <i>genre,</i> their own way of working.  The representative organisations and the military and civil representatives of the Department of Defence have developed a good synergy. It is important that this is so because a great deal of very punctilious work was put into the establishment of the organisations.</P>

Their work is first class and recognised world-wide and, therefore, certificates of competency should be issued to them in recognition of their work.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 11, 19, 21, 34, 61, 67, 72, 75 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>There are six Irish military officers serving as observers in Western Sahara. When Irish military observers were first deployed in Western Sahara last September as part of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), logistic support provided by the United Nations was inadequate. This was due partly to the fact that United Nations equipment shipped to the area was held at Moroccan ports. These supplies were released in December 1991 and the situation is now improving. Steps are being taken to erect modern prefabricatd camps in order to provide adequate accommodation for UN military observers.  Arrangements are also being made by the United Nations to improve the supply of food, fuel and water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Observers in most UN missions are required to carry out logistical and administrative duties in addition to their operational duties.  There are no reports available to the military authorities that such duties are preventing officers serving <Col N="79" /> with MINURSO from carrying out their peacekeeping duties.</P>
    <P>No reports of attacks or threatened attacks on observers by Moroccan personnel have been received.  A good working relationship is understood to exist between MINURSO and Moroccan forces.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that the first priority for the Government in relation to participation in United Nations missions is to ensure the safety and well-being of the members of the Permanent Defence Forces and of the Garda Síochána who serve with them. We will continue to monitor closely all developments in Western Sahara affecting the Irish members of MINURSO.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is he aware of a staff report to the Committee of Foreign Relations in the US Senate in January of this year which very clearly outlined the serious problems in the Western Sahara in relation to the MINURSO operations there?  The report particularly castigated the United Nations support of the MINURSO operation and further stated that the proposed referendum was in danger because of the lack of co-operation between the UN MINURSO and the Moroccan authorities.  They also said that the matter was being viewed very seriously.  Will the Minister raise this matter with the United Nations to ensure that the operation is not hindered and that peacekeeping duties are conducted properly instead of the personnel being involved in logistical and administrative duties, which is happening at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been made aware of the report.  The United States supply 30 of the 375 personnel and, of course, they have an equal interest in seeing that their personnel are properly looked after. It is my obligation to ensure that our six Army officers are properly equipped for the mission which they are carrying out for the United Nations.  As the House knows, it is a difficult one because of the political situation in the Western Sahara <Col N="80" /> but conditions have improved since the report was made and we are in constant touch with our officers to ensure they get adequate support from the United Nations.</P>

      <P>De ghnáth mura bhfuil bóthar ag freastal ar dhá theach cónaithe ar a laghad, nó ag freastal ar deich líon tí i gcás bóthar phortaigh nó talún, níl sé cáilithe chun críche deontais faoi scéim mo Roinne-se. Ní miste a lua chomh maith go dtugtar cúnamh ó am go chéile i gcásanna eisceachtúla i leith bóithre contae.  Sna cásanna sin bíonn ar an údarás áitiúil sciar de chostas na hoibre a sheasamh.</P>
      <P>Is mar seo a leanas a bhí caiteachas mo Roinne-se ar bhóithre le trí bliana anuas: 1989, £298,864; 1990, £672,767; agus 1991, £352,900.</P>
      <P>Bíonn ar iarratasóirí anois foirm iarratais a líonadh nuair a bhíonn cuidiú á lorg acu ó mo Roinnse.</P>

      <P>An bhfuil aon chás inar féidir deontas a fháil gan foirm iarratais a líonadh isteach don Roinn?  An nós imeachta nua é seo nó an raibh sé <Col N="82" /> amhlaidh i gcónaí gur ghá foirm iarratais a chur isteach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Go dtí seo ni raibh foirm iarratais le cur isteach.  Bhí daoine ábalta scríobh ísteach, daoíne aonair, ionadaithe poiblí, comhairleoirí nó Teachtaí Dála, ach tá socrú nua curtha i bhfeidhm agam le déanaí, an fhoirm iarratais, rud a éascaíonn an obair. Bhíodh sé iontach deacair litir a fháil agus gan na sonraí go cruinn inti agus b'fhéidir gurbh éigean an litir a chur chuig an choiste contae ionas go mbeadh siadsan in ann an bóthar a fhiosrú.  Tá súil agam, dá bhrí sin go gcuirfear fáilte roimh an bhfoirm iarratais.</P>

      <P>An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit a rá cathain ar cuireadh tús le nós seo na bhfoirmeacha iarratais.  An bhféadfadh sé a rá ina theannta sin cé hé go beacht a dhéanann cinneadh maidir le hiarratas: an tAire féin, nó an tAire Stáit nó státseirbhíseach sa Roinn?  Agus cén fáth, tar éis £672,000 a chaitheamh i 1990, nár caitheadh ach £352,000 an bhliain seo caite.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>B'fhéidir nach bhfuil a fhios ag an Teachta ach sa bhliain 1990 bhí deacrachtaí ann sna Gaeltachtaí éagsúla agus chuir Roinn na Gaeltachta £300,000 ar fáil chun bóithre contae a dheisiú: £100,000 i nDún na nGall, £90,000 i nGaillimh, £60,000 i Mhaigh Eo, £30,000 i gCiarraí agus £20,000 i gContae Chorcaí.  Bhíomar ag iarraidh a chur ina luí ar na húdaráis áitiúla cé chomh tábhachtach is a bhí sé na bóithre sin a dheisiú.  Níl an dualgas sin orainne.</P>

Sa chaoi sin bheadh ar chumas na Roinne meastachán ceart a dhéanamh maidir leis an méid airgid a bheadh ag <Col N="83" /> teastáil ó na Gaeltachtaí ó thaobh dheisiú bóithre de.</P>

Is féidir linn iad a chur ar fáil don chomhairle contae chomh maith.  Ceapaim féin go ndéanfaidh sé seo an córas i bhfad níos éasca do gach uile dhuine a bhfuil caidreamh aige leis an bpobal.</P>

Is í an cheist atá agam ná, nuair a chuirtear iarratas isteach le haghaidh dheontas tí bíonn uimhir chánach an iarrthóra le cur isteach.  An gá an uimhir chánach seo nuair a bhíonn deontas bóthar Gaeltachta á lorg?</P>

      <P>Maidir leis na saoráidí calaíochta ar Oileán Thoraí, cheadaigh Roinn na Gaeltachta deontas lánchostais £76,000 chun a chumasú do Roinn na Mara suirbhéanna áirithe agus staidéar mionsamhail a dhéanamh d'fhonn a aimsiú cad iad na muiroibreacha is fearr a d'fhreastalódh ar mhuintir Thoraí.  Tá na suirbhéanna déanta agus tá an staidéar mionsamhla ar siúl i láthair na huaire.  Nuair a bheidh an staidéar sin críochnaithe, déanfar pleananna a dhearadh agus ullmhófar meastachán costais.

Is gné bhunúsach den togra, áfach, aersheirbhís a chur ar fáil agus tá an cheist áirithe sin á scrúdú ag an Údarás.  Beidh an togra in iomlán idir aerstráice agus aersheirbhís le bhreithniú go cúramach ag an Údarás i dtráth chuí agus, má shocraíonn siad gur chóir dul ar aghaidh leis, tar éis dóibh an costas a bhainfeadh leis a chur san áireamh, beidh an cás le cur faoi bhráid mo Roinne-se le scrúdú.</P>

Tá sé trí bliana beagnach anois ó láinseáladh plean forbartha ar an oileán agus ba é ceann de na príomh-mholtaí a bhí sa phlean ná calafort ceart.  Nach n-aontódh an tAire Stáit, agus bád farantóireachta ag dul i mbun dualgas idir an mhórthír agus Toraí gan mhoill an samhradh seo, go bhfuil sé níos tábhachtaí ná riamh nach ndéanfaí níos mó moille nó faillí faoi chalafort cheart a chur ar fáil ar an oileán sa dóigh is gur féidir leis na daoine dul go dtí an oileán agus teacht ar ais.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

Would he consider that this is something we should examine at this stage with a view to participating and sending a battalion?  Would he not further agree that if we were to do this it would give him an opportunity to recruit more personnel into the Army and thus increase the present number quite substantially? It would appear that the Yugoslavian involvement could be for a number of years; the repayments would <Col N="91" /> eventually come back from the UN and it would be an overall benefit to the Irish Government.</P>

      <P>A total of 17 NCOs were appointed to be officers in 1987 following completion of a potential officers' course. In 1991, one NCO in the Ordnance Corps was appointed to be a technical officer in that corps.  At present 24 NCOs are undergoing a potential officers' course at the Military College, Curragh Camp.

Will he accept that this is a very disappointing record and that urgent attention by his Department is required to ensure that the pattern is <Col N="93" /> redressed?  While I accept that a better picture is emerging in so far as there are 24 NCOs in college at present will the Minister accept that this was the most important area, from the point of view of the status of NCOs within the Defence forces, dealt with in the Gleeson report? Will he confirm if an immediate review of the promotion procedures for NCOs, as recommended in the report of the Gleeson Commission, paragraph 11.2.18, took place and was acted upon?</P>

The number of officers, cadets, NCOs and privates has been increased, from a small number admittedly but percentage wise substantially. As the House knows, 200 women were recruited into An Fóras Cosanta Áitiúil in 1991 and we are continuing to develop the role of women in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 17 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that 24 non-commissioned officers who are due to complete a potential officers course in May 1992 have been given the opportunity of <Col N="99" /> applying to become trainee pilots in the Air Corps following their commissioning as officers.  Two of these NCOs have applied for flying training.</P>
    <P>In 1943, from a class of 31 trainees, 20 sergeant pilots were qualified to fly but by 1950 all of these had left the Air Corps. That was the last occasion on which NCOs were given pilot status.  The question of training NCO's for pilots duties is under consideration.</P>
    <P>A break-down by rank of the current number of pilot officers in the Air Corps is as follows: Brigadier-General 1; Colonel 1; Lieutenant-Colonel 6; Commandant 12; Captain 35; Lieutenant 27 and Second Lieutenant 5.  This makes a total of 87.</P>
    <P>In 1991, seven pilot officers submitted applications for early retirement.  Four of these applications were subsequently withdrawn, two applications were granted and the remaining application was refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1990 it has been the policy to allow a limited number of Air Corps officers to retire each year.  The number granted permission to retire in 1990 and <Col N="105" /> 1991 was four and two respectively.  It is proposed to allow a further two officers to retire this year.</P>
    <P>Since 1989 a total of 17 officers have qualified as pilots and a further seven officers are due to complete their flying training in May 1992.  Twelve Air Corps cadets are due to be commissioned in 1992, after which they will commence flying training.  A competition for the award of eight Air Corps cadetships is being held at present.  I might mention in that regard that a new selection system has been introduced which it is expected will lead to a substantial reduction in the failure rate during flying training.</P>
    <P>During the past three years two additional officers have been transferred from the Army for training as air traffic controllers.</P>
    <P>In 1990 two aeronautical engineer officers were recruited as a result of a public competition.  It is hoped to recruit a further aeronautical engineer this year.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendation of the Gleeson Commission, pilot officers, air traffic control officers and aeronautical engineer officers who have completed 12 years' service are paid an ex-gratia sum of £3,000 in respect of each year for which they are retained in service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it the Minister's intention to comply with the recommendation in the Gleeson report that there should be a terminal date for compulsory retention?  When will the Minister make a decision on the terminal date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made some inquiries about this very delicate subject.  The Army authorities and my Department have a very soundly based philosophy on this matter, involved with the investment in the training of such an officer and the service to be rendered to the State as a result.  It is a perfectly equitable view. My Department and the Army authorities are progressing along the lines which I outlined in my reply.  Due consideration is being given to the careers of the people concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the present policy is an intrusion on the freedom of the individual and could be considered to be unconstitutional?  The military authorities are adopting a very dogmatic dictatorial attitude in relation to this matter. Will the Minister explore the possibilities of relieving these personnel on the basis of some kind of agreement between the individual and the military authorities in relation to compensation for the training provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that there is any intrusion on the freedom of an individual who willingly and knowingly takes on a certain period of duty.  Nevertheless there is a good deal of substance in the suggestion by the Deputy that this whole consideration should be very carefully monitored and examined with a view to seeing to it that equity prevails with regard to members of the Air Corps.</P>

      <P>Three out of a total of eight air traffic control officers in the Ai Corps were former NCOs.</P>
      <P>None of the nine NCOs in the Ai Corps who are employed in air traffic control applied to undergo a potential officers course which commenced in September 1991.  The 24 NCOs who are on that course were given the opportunity of applying for training as air traffic control officers after being commissioned, but none applied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate when the three people he mentioned were appointed?  To what extent <Col N="107" /> have the Air Corps responded to the Gleeson recommendation that steps be taken as a matter of urgency to facilitate the appointment of non-commissioned officers to the position of air traffic controller? Has anything specific been done to ensure that the recommendation is acted on urgently?  Would the Minister comment on the reluctance of NCOs to seek the position?  Is that due to the absence of adequate inducements to NCOs to work in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Three of the air traffic controllers are former NCOs.  I do not have details of the date they were appointed.  I do not quite understand the Deputy's suggestion about inducements. The conditions of pay and service of air traffic controllers are well known and are obviously attractive to some.  In this case the 24 NCOs when asked if they wished to apply for training as air traffic control officers simply said they did not want to apply.  That does not necessarily mean that the conditions of pay and service were unsatisfactory from their point of view.  They made a professional choice which did not involve air traffic control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a remarkable inconsistency between, on the one hand, the matter of urgency identified by Gleeson and, on the other hand, the fact that the entire complement of NCOs did not see the attractions of taking up training in a highly specialist and desirable career? Regarding appropriate inducements, paragraph 11.2.20 of the Gleeson report recommends the putting in place of a series of inducements such as remuneration and promotional prospects to attract NCOs into areas where they otherwise might be slow to trespass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the individuals concerned looked at the promotional prospects.  The position of air traffic control officer is very responsible and highly qualified.

The contents of the regulations are reviewed and updated on a continuous basis by: the making of amendments thereto providing for additions and deletions; incorporating amendments into the main regulations and having them reprinted; rewriting new versions of existing regulations; and cancellation of obsolete regulations.

Would the Minister agree that, in the context of the recommendations of the Gleeson report with regard to the redress of wrongs and the need to improve the appeals and complaints procedures within the Defence Forces, a very useful working basis for such improvement would be a simplification of the regulations which govern virtually every aspect of a soldier's life on a daily basis?</P>

Arrangements for the implementation of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, within the Defence Forces have been made and an advisory committee comprising civil and military representatives of my Department were established more than a year ago to coordinate and monitor progress in this area.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee have had consultations with the representative associations in the case of military personnel and trade unions in the case of civilian employees with the Defence Forces.

Is the Minister satisfied that there is full understanding and appreciation of the legalities that exist with regard to the implementation of this important legislation throughout the Defence Forces?  Is he aware of an incident reported in the media since the establishment of this committee, of officers refusing to cooperate with inspectors from the Department who were seeking to establish whether or not the Act was being implemented?

All units of the Defence Forces have already elected their safety representatives.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 3 to 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that we have been able to give this Bill a fair amount of public airing in the past week or so.  Amendment No. 1, in the names of myself and my colleague, Deputy Browne (<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>), covers an important issue to <Col N="170" /> which I wish to refer.  It aims to delete section 6, which alters the rates of the family income supplement.  The objective in tabling the amendment is to bring to the Floor of the House the importance of the elimination of the poverty trap.  As I said on a previous occasion, it is very important to have a basis on which to have that elimination and in my view the family income supplement provides that basis.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was introduced in the mid-1980s it was intended for people in a low-paid job who could not aspire to earn a living from the rewards of that job.  It was felt that if assistance was necessary to keep a job alive then there was an onus on the State to keep the worker off social welfare.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I am somewhat disappointed at the results of the family income supplement to date.  Fewer than 7,000 people have made successful application for funds and some of those who have been successful have received so little from the scheme that they would be almost as well off if they were not eligible. In the past couple of weeks I have made the case very strongly &mdash; and I reiterate it today &mdash; that it is important to change the present system to have calculations made on a worker's net pay rather on than his or her gross pay.  It makes very little difference to a wage earner, particularly if that person is married and has a family, to be eligible for family income supplement of, perhaps, £20 or £30 a week, if before that supplement can be claimed the Revenue Commissioners take £20 or £30 a week off his or her pay in tax.  The worker is running to a standstill.  It is very important that this issue be addressed now.</P>
    <P>The Minister did respond to my suggestions when the topic was discussed last week but I am somewhat disappointed that he does not envisage a greater role for the family income supplement.  I should like that scheme to have a dual role.</P>
    <P>I have examined legislation governing many aspects of the famous poverty trap syndrome that we have in Ireland.  There are many matters I cannot go into today <Col N="171" /> because I assume that would be out of order in so far as tax is concerned.  So far as social welfare is concerned, it certainly appears to me that there is no better basis upon which to build than the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Bell who raised the other side of the coin during previous discussions.  I accept that if we are not careful the family income supplement could become an instrument to be used by employers who want cheap labour.  In our efforts to strike a balance we have to consider that point.</P>
    <P>Under present conditions in Ireland, in which we have 280,000 people out of work a figure that is rising by the month, it should be possible for this scheme to apply to more than 7,000 people.  That is my basic principle.  For instance, if 12,000 to 15,000 people could be brought into the scheme those people would be saved from going on the dole.  Many people decide to sign on for the dole when they realise that they would be better off on the dole than working.  This issue hits at the very ethos of our society and that is why I have talked so much about it throughout the debate.  I am sure the Minister would agree that it is very important that we get the answer.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that all unemployment problems will not be answered through the family income supplement.  However, in relation to the objective of the scheme, many previous Ministers for Social Welfare in different Governments have stated that the only reason the scheme did not work was that people did not know about it.  I do not accept that argument. Many people go without a medical card simply because they do not know whether they are eligible for one, but that is not the real reason that the family income supplement has not been very successful.  On Second Stage we spoke about the importance of providing information to applicants for social welfare and I hope that the Minister will take on board many of the points that were made then.  However, there is something deeper behind this issue and I should like to try to tease that out here in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> I wish to put before the Minister the importance of getting this issue right this time.  No Government have got it right yet.  I shall only believe that we have got it right when many more families become eligible for the family income supplement. I do not care how many leaflets the Government send out, there will not be too much of an uptake of the scheme under the present circumstances.  From inquiries I have made of the Department, I understand that the figures for 1992 are expected to be no better &mdash; perhaps the result will show a difference of a few hundred one way or the other.</P>
    <P>If we believe that the scheme is an important weapon in the battle to beat the poverty trap and eliminate it as much as possible &mdash; as I believe and as Fine Gael believe &mdash; then we will have to stop talking about the issue and do something about it.  So far as this overall area is concerned, in our discussions here over the past week, it had been hoped that in the next year or two at least an additional 6,000 to 10,000 families would see it was better for their breadwinner to be working than be on the dole.  I imagine there are very few people who would not agree with that contention.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is that people are afraid of applying for this family income supplement.  No doubt the Minister's national network of social welfare officers must have built up a great bank of knowledge as to why this scheme is not working.  I would have to say I believe it is not working.  I have been in touch with the Department on behalf of many constituents.  These would be people not in good financial circumstances but, because of the manner in which the guidelines for our provisions of the scheme are worded, they would need to be very badly off before they would benefit substantially.  That indicates to me that it is the framework of the scheme that is wrong or at fault.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne and I have been proposing the idea over the past week or so, indeed for much longer, that if the Department would only revert to the system of assessment based on net rather <Col N="173" /> than gross income that might resolve the problem.  I know that all schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare are paid on the basis of gross income and that to revert to net income would be a substantial change.  Nonetheless we here must determine once and for all whether jobs are sufficiently important. That is why I said a week ago I believe that, in many respects, the provisions of this Bill are anti-work, anti-employment, which has been manifested by the threat to redundancy payments and the curtailment of the pay-related social insurance schemes.  The family income supplement was a positive scheme designed for a particular purpose within the workforce.  To the extent that it has achieved that purpose it has to be welcomed but is totally under-utilised. Nothing I have heard the Minister say by way of reply over the past week would indicate to me that there are any ideas within his Department to change the overall position.  If it is that the combined wisdom within the Minister's Department is to allow sleeping dogs lie, then we must assume that whatever benefits the family income supplement may have had have been delivered and the scheme will be of little advantage in the future.</P>
    <P>I had always understood that it would be very important that the provisions of the family income supplement be extended to small farmers and others. The Minister replied, in part quite positively, to the effect that he was examining whether, in certain circumstances in the future, its provision might apply to small farmers.  At the time I think that proposal carried a price tag of £10 million.  Since then I have had discussions with some of the farming organisations, and from my knowledge of this sector I find it extremely difficult to understand how it would cost £10 million.  I will tell the House why.  If it is that 7,000 people can be eligible under the normal criteria obtaining, which costs something in the region of £9 million, of course there would be many farmers whose incomes, would be such that the benefits of this scheme would be a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo;.  Therefore, as is the case now, many would receive <Col N="174" /> only a small amount of money.  Obviously the Minister must be thinking of including about 20,000 farmers.</P>
    <P>When one bears in mind that there are approximately 13,000 farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance, that raises two issues, one of which I have been repeating for years, which is that the circumstances in which many farmers find themselves are indeed distressing. However, this is neither the time nor place to speak of farmers' problems.  But, as regards the family income supplement I always believed its provisions had a part to play in respect of such farmers.  For whatever reason many agencies have engaged in analyses of and research into the eligibility guidelines for unemployment assistance as they relate to farmers, have found that many thousands of farmers do not have anythng like a taxable income and are not entitled to unemployment assistance.  It is about such people I am speaking.  As the Minister himself will be aware, farmers' dole creates circumstances in which many people become less productive on their farms than they might have been otherwise because it is assessed on an income/expenditure basis.  Obviously this means the more one has, or the more income one generates for oneself and one's family the less is the likelihood one will receive the dole.</P>
    <P>I spent some time examining this aspect in the eighties and discovered there was no easy answer.  That is why I was of the impression that the family income supplement should fill that vacuum perfectly.  Obviously this would necessitate the preparation of accounts with the involvement of the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not for a moment suggesting that anything other than strict guidelines should apply.  This would mean that Members of this House and the Minister could stand over a scheme that would channel Exchequer resources to such people.  The Minister's predecessor must have had something like this in mind when, in the 1991 budget, £1 million was earmarked to help farmers at a particular income level.  An unusual position arose in that that amount actually <Col N="175" /> went back to the Exchequer because nobody could devise a scheme that would allow that amount be paid.  Our amendment No. 1 relates to that, in that the self-employed &mdash; and I am not now speaking only of small farmers but of small shopkeepers and many others with a very reasonable level of income &mdash; would have had their jobs secured had this money been paid them.</P>
    <P>There has been too much glib talk over the past five years in particular about the importance of eliminating the poverty trap without there having been anything done about it.  I suggest that this Bill presents an ideal opportunity.  We acknowledge that the bed has been made for this year, but we would like the Minister to give us some indication of the direction of the entire scheme and what he envisages the provisions of this scheme might be able to achieve by way of, (a) protecting existing jobs, and (b) reducing the numbers in receipt of the dole, I would very much appreciate the Minister outlining his views, or what he thinks about it, for the benefit of the House.  It is a most important concept, something we should examine closely before turning our backs on it and trying out something else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>On first sight I thought this amendment was a typographical error in that it seeks the deletion of an entire section which, unless I read it incorrectly, would mean that the family income supplement would disappear from the Bill and no longer obtain.  I was somewhat confused when Deputy Connaughton spoke because I thought he was making a case for its extension to small farmers, whereas his amendment seeks its abolition. Then I thought there might have been a proposal to insert something in its place but I do not see any.  Perhaps I am misinterpreting the provisions of the amendment or am hearing incorrectly, but before we vote on the amendment this point needs to be clarified: is what appears on the amendment sheet accurate and does it actually mean that the family income supplement should be <Col N="176" /> abolished completely without any replacement?  As I read it, that is what is proposed.  Obviously the Labour Party could not support such a proposal.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have consistently called for improvements to the family income supplement scheme and I spoke about this issue at length on Committee Stage.  I suggested that an application form for the scheme should be included with the certificates now being issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  This would explain the system to those in the PAYE sector, make more people aware of the scheme and explain how they should apply for the benefit.  The Minister said he would look seriously at my suggestion. I assume his officials have had consultations with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to making that alteration and I would be interested in hearing this response.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party strongly believe that responsibility for the family income supplement scheme should be transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Labour.  There was some disagreement about this proposal on Committee Stage.  Since then I have discussed it with trade union representatives, with people interested in labour legislation, those interested in the activities of FÁS and those who did not avail of the family income supplement scheme because they thought the benefit was given to the unemployed or those in part-time jobs.  Those people thought they would have to queue to receive this benefit and did not realise it could be sent by post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Labour can best promote this scheme.  I hope the Minister can give a positive response to my proposal. If the scheme was administered by the Department of Labour people would not regard it as a social welfare benefit. It would not be any different to the payments by FÁS to people who are on courses or receiving training.  By transferring responsibility to the Department of Labour the scheme would be regarded as a benefit given to people at work rather than a handout by the State to the unemployed. I am more in favour now of transferring <Col N="177" /> responsibility for this scheme to the Department of Labour than I was on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not know the implications of my proposal.  Obviously, it would be necessary to have consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the trade unions representing officials in the Departments of Social Welfare and Labour.  The scheme would operate better if it was organised and controlled by the Department of Labour and payments made through FÁS offices which are located in virtually every urban area. In addition, it would tidy up the scheme.</P>
    <P>The bulk of workers in low paid jobs are represented by organisations and committees which are under the auspices of the Department of Labour.  I am referring to organisations such as the joint labour committees for the clothing, textiles and footwear industries, farm labourers and hotel and catering workers.  A large proportion of people employed in those industries would be entitled to benefit from the scheme. Will the Minister indicate if he has initiated discussions, or will initiate discussions, between the two Departments and interested parties?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party could not support this amendment as it would eliminate the payment of up to £40 per week to 7,000 families.  If this happened the scheme would be withdrawn.  This point needs to be highlighted.  Deputy Connaughton referred to the payment of the family income supplement to farmers.  The Labour Party support the principle of paying this benefit to farmers who cannot make a living from their small farms in the same way as it is paid to workers in the industrial and services sectors.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to Deputy Connaughton, who moved this amendment, that a large percentage of small farmers are entitled to receive what is called the farmers' dole or a reduced rate of unemployment assistance.  I assume the Deputy is not proposing that farmers who receive unemployment assistance should also be entitled to receive a family income supplement.  People in the commercial sector are not entitled to receive both <Col N="178" /> benefits and, obviously, the Labour Party could not support the concept that one section of the community would be entitled to draw unemployment assistance and a family income supplement.  I assume Deputy Connaughton is not suggesting that.  The payment of two benefits would not only be financially impossible but would be irresponsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> We tabled this amendment to indicate our dissatisfaction with the family income supplement scheme as it is operated.  I am sure Deputy Bell appreciates that if we had brought in another amendment it would not have been in order and we would not be discussing the matter now.</P>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, I believe workers should be given every encouragement to stay at work.  Entitlement to benefit should be based on net rather than gross pay.  There is something ironic in having tax paid to the Government recorded as income. This is what gives rise to the poverty traps.  In some cases people would be better off unemployed with a medical card and so on than working.  Assessing a person's eligibility for a family income supplement on the basis of gross pay is causing havoc for workers.  I accept that if income tax is deducted and a family income supplement is paid it may appear that money is going around in circles. However, the people involved might be better off if this was done rather than allowing tax concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something wrong about expecting people to accept deductions of income tax as part of their salaries when their eligibility for a family income supplement is being assessed.  People get very annoyed when they are told that the scheme is based on their gross pay.  It would be more realistic if people on low pay who pay a small amount of tax could be assessed on their net rather than gross pay.  If this were done obviously the Government would have to adjust many other allowances to balance the system. If the system was fair it would encourage people to stay at work.  We must do everything possible to keep people at <Col N="179" /> work and make them believe they are better off at work.</P>
    <P>I wish to give two examples.  I know one person who is receiving £39 under the family income supplement scheme while another lost £4 in income by taking up employment.  There is something very wrong in our system when that can happen.  Anybody at work should not be worse off than someone who is unemployed. Perhaps the family income supplement could help in such cases.  Will the Minister comment on the net income factor and how he sees the self-employed benefiting from the family income supplement?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat what I said on Committee Stage.  However, I should like to know whether the Minister took on board the suggestion that the family income supplement should relate to the net income, not the gross income?  That point was raised in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare in referring to the low take-up of this scheme.  They said that as fewer than 7,000 families benefit we should do something to encourage those who need it to apply for it.  A sum of £9 million has already been channelled to families on low incomes who are receiving benefits.  Various reports highlighted the fact that a substantial number of families are eligible but, for some unknown reason, they have not applied for the family income supplement.  I hope the Minister and his officials now know how to target those eligible for benefit because it is outrageous that so many people who are eligible do not claim this supplement.  Will the Minister tell the House how he proposes to encourage families who are eligible for this funding to apply for it?</P>
      <P>Sadly, many young people are earning less than £140 per week for full-time work.  That indicates the startling number of people who are badly paid in the community. As people are so badly exploited by unscrupulous employers, perhaps the Minister would consider introducing a basic, minimum hourly rate of pay so that people will not fall into the poverty trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> If such a rate was established the family income supplement would not be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very interesting debate on this matter the last day we discussed the Bill and I know that the family income supplement is very dear to Deputy Connaughton's heart.  At the time of its introduction he saw it as the vehicle for eliminating the poverty trap. However, it has not worked as well as he had hoped.  His amendment proposes eliminating the family income supplement but I know that is not his intention, it is merely to give him an opportunity to reiterate what he said previously.</P>
      <P>Two reports were prepared in relation to the family income supplement, one from the ESRI and another from an independent consultant.  According to the independent consultant, approximately 12,000 recipients should be benefitting under the scheme.  However, in 1991, approximately 7,200 people had taken it up.  Deputy Bell suggested that the Revenue Commissioners should send out an explanatory leaflet with the tax free allowance certificate.  We will take that on board for future occasions.  Deputy Bell also said that payment of the family income supplement is more appropriate to the Department of Labour than to the Department of Social Welfare.  I said I would consider that matter because it relates to people in employment.  Perhaps the reason that people entitled to the scheme have not claimed it is that they regard it as an assistance scheme for unemployed people.  I will examine the feasibility of bringing it under the aegis of the Department of Labour.  There certainly is merit in Deputy Bell's suggestion and perhaps it could be dealt with more effectively in the Department of Labour and in the FÁS offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Connaughton, Browne and Byrne said that the figures should be based on net pay and not on the gross income.  In principle, I have nothing against examining that aspect but perhaps Deputies have not considered the <Col N="181" /> down side.  If there is an adjustment of net pay, a number of things must follow. We would have to change the income limits and the ceilings, otherwise it would cost the State a great deal of extra money. I know what the Deputies are getting at and I thought the same for a while until a few years ago when I realised the difficulties involved in setting net and gross pay levels.  If the family income supplement and other schemes are based on net pay then various thresholds will have to be changed and some people would probably have to pay more tax.  Since we are taking money in tax and PRSI from people, as Deputy Browne pointed out, and giving some of it back in family income supplement the easy answer would be to increase the tax exemption limits.  However, that is a matter for the Minister for Finance and over the past couple of years tax exemption limits have increased.  The reason they have not been increased further&mdash;I am not the Minister for Finance but I can guess what he will say &mdash; is that it would be a very heavy cost to the State.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about disincentives and poverty traps and I also referred to the matter.  I am sure that is the case in some instances but one of the big problems is that gross take home pay is high but a large amount is given to the State.  We must find a system of channelling some of that money to the family income supplement.  I have nothing against looking at the net concept but it must be remembered that I will be adjusting the income limits.  A lot could be done if our financial situation improves.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bell said we must guard against the danger of the family income supplement being a subsidy for employers who will then have low paid employees. That is the balance which must be struck the whole time.  If we increase the upper limits, increasing numbers of employers may believe they can get away with paying lower wages because the family income supplement will bring the family income up to the normal level.  We do not want this to happen.  In that context Deputy Byrne asks why we do not set a <Col N="182" /> basic minimum wage.  As the Deputy may know, I am noted for having done peculiar things in the past but I cannot take it upon myself to announce minimum wage levels as this is a decision for Government and is totally outside my responsibility.  I have no particular view on this matter but we have to guard against employers taking advantage of the increase in the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton made a very good point today, as he did on Committee Stage, as to why the number availing of the family income supplement has not increased.  The Department have done everything they can to publicise the scheme and the Deputy accepts that, however, we have not reached the expected take-up level.  Deputy Connaughton made the case for bringing small farmers into this scheme.  He did not have the opportunity to reply to Deputy Bell who said that Deputy Connaughton would not be expecting small farmers to get the dole.</P>

      <P>As I said the last day, I have no objection to extending the scheme to small farmers and the self-employed. I pointed out that in 1991 a certain amount of money was set aside for this but the negotiations between the IFA, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Social Welfare stalled when they could not agree on a basis for implementing the scheme. That is the situation at present.  If I were to extend the scheme to the small farmers it would cost in the order of £10 million. Deputy Connaughton could not understand why it would cost so much money but the reason is that not only would farmers who qualify for dole come into the scheme but other farmers would also be eligible for the family income supplement. The costing is based on this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, one of my predecessors had gone down the road of extending the scheme to small farmers but after many meetings with the Department of Agriculture and Food and with <Col N="183" /> the IFA they could not agree on how the scheme should operate.  We are experiencing similar problems but I am not ruling this out totally and perhaps we could succeed where greater men than I have failed.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Connaughton may know, I will have to oppose his amendment, otherwise I would be abolishing the family income supplement scheme in total.</P>

They are another layer entirely.  I pointed out very clearly that I wanted to see the scheme tightly controlled.  I understand this is one of the reasons the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the IFA got bogged down in negotiation. I sincerely hope they will reach agreement on it soon so that the Minister may be able to introduce such a scheme in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>The Minister proposes to amalgamate two maternity schemes.  By the clever sleight of hand he intends to use his power to debar a very important group of women from benefit.  That is the reason we want this issue debated.  I have no problem with the section when it deals <Col N="186" /> with the benefits to women who are in full time employment and are entitled to maternity benefit but I am trying to protect those women who, to date, have been in receipt of a maternity allowance. Those women are in receipt of maternity allowance, as per his own booklet which states that this maternity allowance scheme is for women who are not in employment or who do not intend to return to work.  It specifies how they would qualify and how they would be eligible for benefit if they have 39 PRSI paid contributions, of which, at least, 13 weeks must be paid contributions in the governing tax year.  We teased out this matter on Committee Stage but I am worried that a substantial number of women, who are not in full time employment and who do not intend to return to work, will be excluded form benefit.  Not only that, there is another group of women who will be equally effected.  The effect of the rationalisation of the two existing maternity schemes will be to remove entitlements from certain women and make it more difficult for others to qualify in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present most women in regular employment can qualify for maternity benefit so long as they follow the prescribed procedures and have a job to return to following their maternity leave. However, the women to whom I am referring are those who have left, or have lost, their jobs a short time before the pregnancy but still satisfy their PRSI contributions, that is, that they have worked and paid PRSI for the requisite number of weeks in the previous tax year.  Up to now they have been eligible for £50 per week under the general scheme and extra benefit was to be paid for each child dependant.  I do not want to see a single woman lose the benefit of that scheme.  I am concerned that a substantial number of women will lose out in the scheme but also there are women in receipt of certain other payments, for example, deserted wives, lone parents, widows and prisoners' wives who are entitled to maternity allowances at half the normal rate.  I understand these categories will no longer qualify unless they are in <Col N="187" /> employment, and clearly the vast majority are not.</P>
    <P>We are opposing four pages of suggested deletions because we do not want to see the principal Act amended in a way which would debar those who are eligible at present for maternity allowance because of their PRSI cover.  I would ask the Minister to take those points on board.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned that the Minister is abolishing credits for PRSI. A large number of women are in credit but the Minister proposes to abolish those credits.  It will have a shattering effect on women in particular but on men, too, that they will not be able to accumulate sufficient credits.  It is important to make that point.  If a person is ill or on maternity leave for 14 weeks and is on disability benefit or whatever, the credit that would normally accrue to them would leave them in benefit at a later stage.  I am concerned that under the Minister's proposals that would no longer be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment briefly on the last point raised by Deputy Byrne.  The question of credits is causing havoc for women in particular.  I would ask the Minister to confirm whether this proposal is to be implemented or whether he is withdrawing it, having seen another flash of light.  It is not fair that credits would be eliminated.  It would do much harm to people who would normally qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with the last point regarding credits.  I do not see any change in the Bill but perhaps the Minister would clarify the point made by Deputy Browne.  As I understand it, credits do not qualify for any payment. The only credit that qualifies for payment is effectively a credit where a person is in receipt of disability benefit.  Therefore, that would qualify for credit for payment of unemployment benefit if the person subsequently went on unemployment benefit or needed 39 contributions or credits within the contribution year.  It is <Col N="188" /> important that the Minister clarifies that point.</P>
      <P>There are two kinds of credits: one effectively gives benefit and the other is where a person is out of benefit and signs on credit, and qualifies only for optical or dental requirements.  If the dental benefit is agreed then the person concerned could claim benefit on the spouse's contribution but that does not apply in respect of optical benefit.  That point needs to be clarified.  My understanding of credits is substantially different from that of the Minister in relation to both the present Act and the regulations.  I would be concerned if what Deputy Browne said proved to be correct.</P>
      <P>In regard to maternity benefit I would share Deputy Byrne's concern.  I understood from the debate on Committee Stage &mdash; where I raised the matter &mdash; that if a woman is in receipt of maternity benefit for 14 weeks and decides, before she draws it in full or at the time when her benefit is exhausted, that she will not return to work, she is entitled to claim unemployment assistance subject to a means test if she is not in benefit.  If she is ill following the birth of the baby she is entitled to go on to disability benefit, if she is in benefit.  I do not follow the issue from the point of view that I do not think that is what the regulations specify at present.  Again, that matter should be clarified by the Minister and his officials. Will it mean that at the exhaustion of the maternity benefit allowance &mdash; which is to be benefit now because the two will be amalgamated &mdash; a woman would be entitled to claim unemployment or disability benefit or, if she was not entitled to benefit under those two headings, to apply for employment assistance or the disabled persons maintenance allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Byrne has noticed this but the only amendments which have not been ruled out of order are amendments Nos. 1, 7, 19, 20 and 21. As I see it, if we were to vote for the amendment, which would effectively delete sections contained in approximately four and half pages of the Bill, given that amendment No. 8 has been ruled out of order, the maternity allowance <Col N="189" /> scheme would disappear.  The position therefore needs to be clarified. Obviously, this could not be seen before the amendments were ruled out of order. As amendment No. 8 cannot be moved, if amendment No. 7 were passed, the maternity allowance scheme would disappear and we would be left with no allowance.  I am sure that was not the intention of Deputy Byrne.  If that is the effect it would have, we should not discuss the matter any further and certainly not vote for it.  As I see it, that is the effect it would have.</P>

      <P>While I realise my amendment has been ruled out of order, I wish to seek clarification from the Minister. When I raised this matter on Committee Stage the Minister agreed to examine and clarify it with regard to the maternity allowance scheme.  I take if we are talking about the section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but I was at a meeting.  Perhaps this matter has been discussed already but in relation to this allowance can the Minister say once the Bill is passed, if it will continue to be payable to women who are not in employment and who do not intend to return to work?  If they had paid PRSI for 39 weeks or had paid PRSI and received credits for 39 weeks of which 13 at least has been paid for, in the governing tax year, this allowance was payable, and was availed of by women who had left work and decided not to return after having their baby.  They had signed on for credits and paid the necessary contributions in the relevant tax year.  No reference is made to this matter in the Bill?  The provision requires that the contributions must have been paid in the previous year.  This alters the position completely.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned to the Minister last week, two women, who are to lose the maternity allowance, have contacted me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> I have spoken to some trade unionists who have indicated to me that they informed officials in the Department that they wished to be told if changes were to be made in the maternity allowance scheme.  However they were not informed of this change at the initial consultation and it was only when they probed further that they were told that the allowance was going to be axed and that women who were signing on and receiving a reduced rate of benefit would not be allowed to avail themselves of it. Perhaps I am wrong and this will prove not to be the case but I would like to complete what I have to say because I can speak only once.  I hope this change is not being made by stealth because no reference was made to it in the budget speech.  It would be regrettable if this was the case.</P>
    <P>While many women and trade unionists are very concerned, I should say that I welcome the section.  Indeed, one is almost made feel guilty for criticising the section what the Minister is doing is worthwhile &mdash; is including part-time female workers in the maternity allowance scheme.  While this is important and good, I would like to know what is going to happen to the other group.  It would be most unfortunate if this group of people were to be placed outside the scheme once the Bill is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision was made for this change in last year's Bill but it will not take effect until part-time workers are included in the scheme.  The two schemes will be merged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last day I said I would clarify the position in relation to some of the matters raised.  In relation to the matters raised by Deputy Bell, he was mostly correct with regard to the maternity allowance scheme but I have learned a little about credits in the meantime.  Deputy Byrne accused me of being a Thatcherite but to paraphrase the words of the great lady herself, &ldquo;credits are credits are credits&rdquo;. Those in receipt of unemployment benefit and disability benefit are given credits. Even though they sign the register they do not get a payment but rather <Col N="191" /> are given credits which may prove to be useful when they become entitled to a payment again.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out previously &mdash; indeed, Deputy Fennell pointed this out today &mdash; there are some good things in this section, the purpose of which is to merge the two maternity allowance schemes.  The last day we decided to leave the matter over until today so that I could clarify the matter in relation to a number of the points raised.  When Deputy Byrne accused me of being a Thatcherite as well as being a feminist he forgot to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that matter later.  I have no difficulty in defending this change.  As Deputy Fennell is aware, there are many people &mdash; I have seen this for myself in the towns <Col N="192" /> of Kildare &mdash; who have not been part of the workforce for a long time and who are still signing on for credits in the expectation that at some date in the future they may have another child and qualify for maternity benefit even though they have no intention in the wide earthly world of returning to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that only 100 people will be affected; how can he expect everybody to know who these will be, given that there are only 3.5 million to four million people in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We estimate that that number of people will be affected.  These are signing on for a particular reason.  As Deputy Byrne knows, every woman does not decide to get pregnant every year either.  That is a matter for themselves but many people sign on for this purpose. As I said, we think that only 100 people will be affected in any one year.</P>
      <P>There are two maternity allowance schemes in operation at present &mdash; the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment, which is known as the new scheme, and the general maternity allowance scheme, which is known as the old scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new scheme was introduced in 1981 and applied to women who were covered by the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981.  That Act provided for maternity leave and the right to return to work for women in the workforce who became pregnant.  Broadly speaking, the Act covered women working more than 18 hours a week.  The new <Col N="193" /> maternity allowance scheme provides a 14-week maternity allowance for women who are covered by the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act who satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions.  The Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act was extended in 1991 to cover part-time workers.  It now broadly covers all women who work for more than eight hours a week.  The scope of the new maternity allowance scheme was automatically extended to cover these workers.</P>
    <P>The general maternity allowance scheme was in existence prior to the introduction of the new scheme.  It provided an allowance for 12 weeks at a lower rate and subject to similar contribution conditions as the new scheme, except that a minimum of 13 paid contributions were required in the governing contribution year.  This assumed that the women concerned had a recent attachment to the workforce.</P>
    <P>Consequent on the introduction of the new scheme the only women covered by the old scheme were those at work but not covered by the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, that is, women working fewer than 18 hours per week, and women who were not at work but who could fulfil the contribution conditions. The extension of the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act in 1991 to women working eight hours a week or more extended the coverage of the new maternity allowance scheme and reduced the old scheme to a more residual role.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Social Welfare Act provided for the discontinuance of the old maternity allowance scheme consequent on the extension of the scope of the new scheme.  The relevant provision of the 1991 Act has not, however, been invoked pending a review of the arrangements for the social insurance cover for part-time workers in the context of the extension of the new scheme.  The social insurance system now covers workers earning £25 a week or more, regardless of the hours worked.  They will be covered for maternity allowance.  Section 19 provides for the discontinuance of the old scheme and the extension of the new scheme to <Col N="194" /> cater for working women earning £25 or more who would not otherwise be catered for by this new scheme.  The arrangements now being introduced will result in a single, streamlined maternity benefit scheme covering all women at work or who intend to return to work and meet the required contribution conditions.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the discontinuance of the general maternity scheme is as follows.  The scheme caters at present for three categories of claimant. It caters for women who are in employment and paying social insurance contributions but who fail to qualify under the scheme for women in employment because they are not covered by the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act.  These are part-time workers working fewer than eight hours per week and contract workers.  This category constitutes 10 per cent of claimants under the general scheme.  All women in this category will now qualify under the scheme for women in employment.</P>
    <P>The second group covered under the general scheme are women who are claiming unemployment benefit or disability benefit immediately before claiming maternity allowance.  From now on, women in this category, who account for about 88 per cent of all claimants, will remain on whatever social welfare payment they are receiving.  Their rate of payment will be the same as if they were on the general maternity allowance scheme, or higher, depending on individual circumstances, for example for women entitled to pay-related benefit with unemployment benefit and women entitled to an increase for a dependant spouse.</P>
    <P>The third group covered under the general maternity allowance scheme are women who are not in employment and are not in receipt of unemployment benefit or disability benefit.  Women in this category account for 2 per cent of claimants under the general scheme.  These women can qualify under the general scheme at present on the basis of PRSI contributions paid during an earlier employment.  This happens because of <Col N="195" /> the practice of determining entitlement to benefit on the basis of contributions paid during the governing contribution year, which can be up to 21 months prior to a claim being made.  For example, the governing contribution year for a claim payable at any time during 1992 is the year ended April 1991.  Even though the contribution conditions under the new arrangements for the scheme for women in employment are more lenient than those applying under the general scheme, a prerequisite for qualifying under the scheme for women in employment is that the claimant must be in current employment or returning to a specific employment. Consequently, a very small number of women who are not in employment will not now qualify for maternity benefit.  The numbers involved are estimated at fewer than 100 in a year.  The underlying <i>rationale</i> of maternity leave and maternity benefit is that the schemes exist in order to allow the woman in employment to take leave from work without undue loss of income.</P>
    <P>The only other change provided for under the new arrangements is that the minimum payment available under the scheme, currently set at £76 per week, will be reduced to £60 per week in view of the extension of the scheme to part-time workers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I am fully aware of the &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; situation in which I find myself.  I move the amendment deliberately because on Committee Stage we were unable to reach section 36 which deals with the carer's allowance.  One of the reasons for my putting down this amendment with my colleague, Deputy Browne, <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> is our frustration at the way the carer's allowance scheme is being operated.  I do not want the amendment to be construed as an <Col N="197" /> attempt to take away benefit from the relatively few participants in the scheme. This is the only mechanism I can think of to highlight in this House the scandal of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>This allowance was introduced as a follow-on to the prescribed relative's allowance.  That is the origin of the carer's allowance.  I distinctly remember that a few years ago when the then Minister for Social Welfare announced his intention of bringing in a carer's allowance there was a sigh of relief from thousands of people who were charged with responsibility for looking after the elderly and disabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we discussing amendment No. 19?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was originally section 36.  At that time it appeared that it was the Government's intention to give recognition to the carers of the sick and the elderly.  I know that the funds are limited and that obviously there would have to be checks and balances on whatever scheme is introduced, but in the two years of the operation of this scheme only 9,000 people applied, over 50 per cent of whom were deemed ineligible.  Of the remaining number, only 50 per cent actually received the allowance.  In other words, only slightly over 2,000 people were deemed eligible for the carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various figures have been given as to the number of people who care for the elderly.  If, as some people say, the figure is as high as 80,000 to 90,000, it is ridiculous that only 2,000 people receive the allowance.  I have no intention of delaying the House on this matter because I spoke at great length on it on Second Stage.  However, I would like to make three or four brief points.  When concluding Second Stage last week the Minister spoke about the desirability of transferring responsibility for this allowance to the Department of Health. Maybe it is a health issue, but nevertheless a different perspective will have to be taken of it.  Otherwise, people will <Col N="198" /> find that they are ineligible for the carer's allowance for the silliest of reasons.</P>
    <P>This matter needs to be considered in a very balanced way.  I asked the question on Second Stage what would happen the people being cared for if the carers were not looking after them, taking into account that only about 2,000 people receive up to £50 per week while others receive very little.  Obviously, there would be great social disorder because our geriatric homes, which are already filled to capacity, would not be able to cater for these people.  Perhaps we would introduce a scheme to subsidise private nursing homes &mdash; à Bill to this effect was introduced in the House some months ago.  However, I am not sure that the money required would be available for that purpose.  At the end of the day we would have to build many more public geriatric homes, which would be a very costly exercise.</P>
    <P>Somebody should carry out an evaluation of the costs involved in extending the scheme and the Minister is the most appropriate person to do so.  From my experience as a Deputy and from deputations I meet in relation to this matter, there are thousands of women looking after their elderly or disabled relatives who feel that they have been ignored by the State.  These people give a 24 hour service but at the end of the day their work is not recognised by the State.  It is true that the carer's allowance is not always related to the income of a particular family.  That is why it is quite difficult to find a solution that is reasonably equitable and is not overly costly.  I get the distinct impression from many women that if they were to receive even a very small payment they would be happy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I do not know whether we could afford to pay all the people involved.  Various rules have been laid down in regulations which have the effect of excluding applicants from the scheme.  I would like to refer to a letter which I received from the Department <Col N="199" /> of Social Welfare today dealing with this matter.  It states: &ldquo;In accordance with Social Welfare legislation, a person may not receive the Carer's Allowance if they are currently employed&rdquo;.  That is reasonable because if a person is employed they could not care for their relatives.  The letter goes on to state: &ldquo;According to the Social Welfare Officer's report, he informed us that the applicant concerned is employed on his farm.  Therefore, he is not entitled to the Carer's Allowance in respect of his brother&rdquo;.  The person concerned has only 30 acres of land and has practically nothing to do.  He would not be there at all were it not for the fact that he is caring for his brother.  I understand that it would cost £300 a week to keep that person in the local geriatric home in Loughrea, Galway, which will have no vacancies for the next six months.  There are many instances of people who, because they are in receipt of social welfare, are ineligible for the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>I have always believed that it is not the State's function to pay every person to look after his or her relatives.  As a community and a Christian society families owe it to their parents to do the best they can for them.  That is something I was taught and have always believed. However, there are many thousands of families who find it extremely difficult to care for people who have been bedridden for years, who are disabled and who get very cranky, as one can understand from people who are in great pain.  As a caring society we will have to do more for these people.  I fully realise that it is not possible to put this matter to a vote.  If I did, some people might say that I would be taking the few pounds from the people who receive it.  Of all the amendments that I have tried to table this is the one on which I wanted a vote, and I would have called a vote on Committee Stage if we had reached the amendment then. There are many other aspects to the issue to which my fellow colleagues here will testify because the carer's allowance is a big issue for any TD, whether from a city, town or rural constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> Unless a change is made in the implementation of the carer's allowance fairly soon the number of people applying for it will fall off because it is now regarded as a laugh.  People have no confidence in the carer's allowance.  I am not sure of the official figures but I do predict that unless there is a major change in the system there will be no significant increase in the number of applications, not because people are satisfied but because people are absolutely fed up with the system and want nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>I should like the Ministers to elaborate on a comment he made on Committee Stage about the interaction between social welfare and health in this area.  One way or the other, the carer's allowance is a recognition of work done.  I think that the people who receive it &mdash; in general they are women, as women make up 98 per cent of the carers in Ireland &mdash; would be happy with a very small payment.  Our carers deserve greater recognition than they get.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Everything about the carer's allowance seems very impressive.  A quick examination of the scheme is rather like having a look at a house that is painted on the outside but is wrecked on the inside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as amended on Committee Stage takes one and a quarter pages to define a relevant pensioner.  Those who qualify as relevant pensioners make a very long list.  There are those in receipt of old age pension, invalidity pension, blind pension and maintenance allowance under section 69 of the Health Act; those who receive pensions from Europe; those who receive death benefits by way of widow's or widower's pension; or by way of parent's pension; those who receive retirement pension; those in receipt of lone parent's allowance; and many, many more.  After making one's way through such a long list one realises that the person who is actually caring for someone does not qualify.  That is the real oxymoron.  The list of people who would be covered is as long as my arm but the carer herself &mdash; because, as my <Col N="201" /> colleague said, about 98 per cent of our carers are women &mdash; has to undergo a miserly means test.  The miserly means test provides that anyone with an income greater than £2 has the allowance cut. That concept hangs over any Minister who has to deal with this Bill.  I know it was already hanging over the portfolio when the present Minister took office, but nothing infuriates me more than the realisation that the allowance is cut for anyone with an income greater than £2. These days one could not give £2 to a first communicant who called at one's door without that child talking about one afterwards.  That is a crazy way of dealing with those who apply for the allowance, people serious in making application. There is a long list of people who could be minded, but a wife who is at home looking after someone will find that her husband's income is divided by two and that she is assessed as having an income of half the total.  Nine times out of ten, the carer is assessed as ineligible.</P>
    <P>So often we have discussed in the House the cost that would be incurred by the State if all of the people cared for within the family were in hospital.  They are kept in a home environment out of people's kindness.  I reiterate the point made by Deputy Connaughton that it is very important that we do not forget that families who can help one another should do so.  However, there comes a time when people cannot be looked after at home because of the terrible inconvenience that results.</P>
    <P>We should remember the projection that in the next 20 years there will be 55,000 more people over the age of 65 years than there are at present.  That constitutes an upcoming demand for beds. At the rate the State is not providing beds at the moment, from there will we get 55,000 extra beds?</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that anyone who keeps an old person or an invalid at home is saving the State a fortune. I know that the point to which I have just referred does not perhaps come precisely within the Minister's responsibility and is a matter for the Minister for Health, but if we do not start to provide <Col N="202" /> extra beds for the elderly in advance of a crisis then we will be in fierce trouble. To give a carer an allowance is a very cheap form of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that there will have to be standards.  It should be insisted that a grandmother who is up at 7 o'clock every morning to get the breakfast ready for her family, then has the dinner ready and is able to run out to Mass at 6 o'clock in the evening is looking after a household rather than being cared for.  However, I want to emphasise that sometimes a carer is looking after people who are in bed permanently and who have to be carefully looked after, the carer having to take steps to prevent or treat bedsores and so on.  Often those carers do the work of two nurses.  Sometimes the daughters and daughters-in-law who look after our elderly get nothing from the State, even though it is beyond question that those people are bedridden and were it not for the kindness and care of those women those they care for would have to be in hospital.  Our carers are saving the State £250 a week by keeping those people at home, yet the State can deny them £50 a week.  That aspect should be considered seriously.  We should give consideration to having no means test apply when someone is caring for a person who is confined fulltime to bed.  The women who look after such patients are a bonus to the State and are worth a lot &mdash; literally, they are worth £250 a week.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not bring in an amendment in relation to the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  I realise that a change may come about under regulations, and because of promises made, I am keeping my fingers crossed.  I gave an example of a woman who looks after two DPMA holders. Those two people are genuine cases and have been medically certified as being sufficiently ill to be in receipt of the DPMA.  The carer is a fulltime housewife, but when the husband's income was divided by two she was ruled as ineligible for the allowance.  I previously sought by way of Adjournment Debate that anyone minding two people in receipt of DPMA be given double the qualifying allowance, <Col N="203" /> £104.  I know that the Minister can make that provision by way of regulation.  I saw a man on the other side, whose name I cannot mention, moving his head &mdash; I hope that that means the provision is about to come in under regulation.  No? In the name of fairness, such a measure will have to be implemented if justice is to be done.  Why should a carer be given the allowance for looking after only one person if she is looking after two people? We should remember that those being cared for are not fictitious.  Those I referred to in the case I previously drew to the attention of the House were mentally handicapped adults who are being looked after by their sister.  Why should that woman not be allowed to earn £104 a week?  I am asking for only one payment to that woman, but I am asking for double the qualifying allowance.  I do not understand why, in justice, that cannot be done.  I hope that the Minister will be able to make that change under regulation.  If he does not then I shall ask him to step aside in favour of a previous Minister who was very kind when I raised the issue before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone would share most of Deputy Connaughton's views on the subject.  Of course, I am glad that he has explained that he will not move the amendment, because otherwise we could face the possibility of having no carer's allowance at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would certainly be speaking for all of my colleagues, and virtually everyone else, if I were to express total concern in relation to the carer's allowance.  The wrong impression was created when the scheme was announced.  Everyone thought that people who took care of an elderly person would automatically get the carer's allowance.  Whether that impression was given by the Minister of the time or by the Department or was wrongly interpreted by the news media, the public at large took it that the carer's allowance applied to everybody who took care of an elderly person.  We soon discovered that that was not the case. Indeed the longer it continues the greater <Col N="204" /> is the confusion, Virtually every week Members receive queries from constituents as to why they cannot receive that allowance while others do.  One gets weary trying to explain, I would go so far as to say, to undo the wrong impression created in the public mind whether deliberately or otherwise, there should be a clear definition of who is and who is not entitled to this allowance and in what precise circumstances.  Certainly there is no such clear definition in the public mind while there may be in the case of the Department.</P>
    <P>I have given thought to the points raised about transferring the administration of his allowance to the Department of Health, thence to the health boards.  I have to say I am always somewhat worried about transferring the administration of anything to health boards because they leave much to be desired <i>vis-à-vis</i> administrative efficiency.  Undoubtedly they play an important role in many aspects of hospitalisation, but I do not think they would have the requisite manpower or resources to administer another benefit. I do not want what I say to be interpreted as a criticism of the people who work for health boards; they do the best they can in very difficult circumstances.  Indeed the people drawing on them are becoming increasingly numerous, community welfare offices in many areas being totally overworked, understaffed, endeavouring to cope with the numbers of people and/or subjects they must now endeavour to deal with.</P>
    <P>I would not disagree with the general sentiments expressed in relation to the carer's allowance if I could be assured that the respective health boards would be given the necessary resources with which to undertake that task or administer that allowance, because it relates to health.  Equally it relates to social welfare in that people in receipt of unemployment assistance or, for that matter, unemployment benefit, but particularly those in receipt of unemployment assistance, very often find themselves taking care of an elderly relative.  I remember this issue being debated a few years ago <Col N="205" /> with one of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Dr. Woods, when I contended forcibly that effectively people in receipt of unemployment assistance were being rendered ineligible for it because local deciding officers deemed they were not available for work.  At that time I received an assurance in the House that that direction to deciding officers would be reviewed or changed so that people in receipt of unemployment assistance, men or women, taking care of a relative living with them, or not living in the same house, would not lose their unemployment assistance on the basis of their not being available for work.  I am not satisfied that that direction has been given to deciding officers particularly at regional or local level.  Perhaps the Minister would check on this because it would eliminate a substantial problem.  People actually in receipt of unemployment assistance would have to be transferred to the carer's allowance when the same old rigmarole would begin, necessitating their being meanstested and so on.  There would be a very great proportion of people taking care of elderly relatives who would already be in receipt of one social welfare benefit or another.  They should not be deprived of that benefit if they are able to provide such care.  I contend they should remain on that benefit rather than disqualify them, forcing them to apply for the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Another group of people in respect of whom there should be a hand's off approach are married people.  For example, take the case of a woman whose husband is earning; his total income is taken into account in the means testing of the carer.  That should not be the case. I contend that what a husband or wife earns should not be taken into account. The assessed income should not be based on family income but rather on the income of the person who provides the care.</P>
    <P>Of course, I would not advocate that somebody should be eligible for receipt of two social welfare benefits or that somebody who is working should be granted the carer's allowance; if a person is working obviously they will not be able <Col N="206" /> to take care of a relative or have time to do so.  But in the case of somebody who is not working and whose husband or wife earns in excess of the means test limit, that spouse's income should not be taken into account at all.  By so doing we would encourage many more people to look after their relatives at home, to the benefit of the elderly person and of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be well aware that demand for geriatric beds has reached chronic proportions in most areas.  That is not a criticism of this or any other Government; it is fact of life.  People are living longer.  For example, on average women live 15 years longer than men in geriatric homes.  I do not know the reason, but that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that now men and women can be accommodated in geriatric homes for 20 to 30 years.  It would be preferable to see such elderly people being taken care of by their families. Very often they do not have visitors; they are forgotten about and are simply put away in geriatric homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take a detailed look at this carer's allowance, ascertaining whether he can bring all of the strands together to encourage people to take care of their relatives and to rationalise that allowance.  It may well be that it could best be administered by the Department of Health through the health boards.  If the Minister so decides, it would then have to be administered by the health boards on the basis that community welfare officers would be provided with the necessary facilities and manpower to do so efficiently.</P>

      <P>I suspect that if other Members of the House were aware we were discussing this &mdash; some may not have their monitors turned on &mdash; the benches here would be filled because no other area of social welfare is perceived by politicians generally to operate so inadequately.  They receive constant requests to ascertain whether anything can be done about it.  I would hazard a <Col N="207" /> guess that the gender of carers would be 95 per cent female.  Would I be correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought so.  This raises the female dimension, that group of people who are put down all the time.  I think Ministers are afraid that they would run away with themselves, lose a sense of themselves if they received too much funding or were recognised too fully.</P>
      <P>Like some other speakers, I am one of those old-fashioned people who believe we should care for our relatives.  I should like to think that the tradition in my father's family in County Galway &mdash; the county Deputy Connaughton spoke about &mdash; would strongly prevail, all of us recognising that our parents fulfilled a very useful, honourable role and were deserving of all the care we could give them in their old age.  That is the ideal to which we would all subscribe and which many of us are in a position to provide, but not everybody can do so.  That is the purpose of having a social welfare payment that takes account of need or of dire need.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, I welcomed this allowance with open arms.  In fact I wrote a glowing article in a magazine on one of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Dr. Woods, saying what an enlightened person he was and how wonderful it was that somebody had an insight into these problems.  I genuinely saluted him for this very fruitful change.  I wrote that article at a time when there was general euphoria about the scheme; people thought it was one of the best benefits ever to have been introduced.  However, shortly afterwards we realised that restrictions would be put on the means-testing and women would be deemed to receive half their husband's income.  This meant that thousands of women who were entitled to receive the allowance and should have received it did not qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know of such cases.  I am talking about people who have to look after bedridden grandfathers and grandmothers and aged aunts and uncles who never <Col N="208" /> married and who are unable to look after themselves.  These people require full-time care.  If these people do not have someone to look after them at home they have to go into geriatric homes.  The nurses and people running nursing homes for old people are attempting to do a good job but it is virtually impossible for them to do this.  The degree of luxury and comfort old people receive depends on the payments made.  The degree of comfort my family would like to give to one of my relatives would cost in the region of £300 per week.  This is an extraordinary amount of money, particularly when it is compared to the amount of money given by way of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>There are many defects in the carer's allowance scheme.  In view of the very reasonable submissions and comments which have been made I thought the Department would go back to the blueprint stage of this allowance, realise it was not working or meeting the need for which it was intended and that it needed to be re-examined.  I constantly come across cases where carers are living down the road from or next door to the person who requires care.  The carers look after these old people all day and settle them down for the night.  They are carers in every sense of the word but because they do not live in the house they do not qualify for this allowance.  I think the Minister indicated that responsibility for the scheme may be given to the health boards.  If the scheme is kept in the Department I hope, in view of the way it has been operated, its flaws and the problems which have arisen that the Minister will put his imprint on it and ensure that it is improved and made more relevant to the people who need it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to people who do not receive a carer's allowance.  It should be remembered that 95 per cent of carers are women who work at home.  These people have to provide constant care for their relatives who, in most cases, do not go on holidays and cannot go out for the day; they require care every day of the week.  These carers do not get any respite from this work.  Perhaps the Minister would consider providing some respite to <Col N="209" /> enable these people to take a holiday with their husbands for a week or two.  I am sure all of us have seen how elderly relatives are lovingly looked after. However, the people who look after them need a break.  I should like to think that some of the submissions, comments and recommendations we have made will be taken on board by the Minister and that he will re-examine the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the prescribed relatives allowance was not a great scheme either.  In order to qualify for that allowance a sick person had to nominate a person to receive it.  Because many people were glad to see the end of that scheme I believe they welcomed the carer's allowance without fully examining how it was going to be applied.  I support the comments made by my colleagues in this regard.  I do not think the Minister will hear anything different in any of the contributions about this allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, on his appointment and I wish him every success.  I have no doubt he will do a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, for introducing the carer's allowance, which has been a major development. Like other Members, I would love the carer's allowance to be provided without any means test.  However, anyone who has served in Government will appreciate that that is not possible because of the various competing priorities for the limited resources available. The carer's allowance was a major improvement on the prescribed relatives allowance.  This allowance gave relatives £28 per week compared to the carer's allowance which gives carers £50 per week, which will be increased to £53 a week from July.  It is equally important to point out that the range of people who can qualify for a carer's allowance is much wider than the range of people who could qualify for a prescribed relatives allowance.  The prescribed relatives allowance was very restricted.  I want to <Col N="210" /> give an example of this.  I remember meeting an 88 year old woman in my practice who was being looked after by her son whom she had adopted when he was three years of age.  He had to look after her all the time.  He was not able to look for work or apply for unemployment assistance.  When he applied for a prescribed relative allowance he did not qualify because he was an adopted son and not a natural son.  That is one of the restrictions which existed in that scheme. I believe the carer's allowance is a very worthwhile scheme.  I have no doubt that the Minister will expand the scheme as time goes on.  Indeed, it is expanded each year both in terms of the rate of payment and the range of people who can qualify.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to the administration of the carer's allowance through the health boards.  I would not be in favour of such a proposal.  What we need more than anything else in the delivery of the social welfare system and the support allowances which are in place is integration.  One of the big problems experienced by the people administering the scheme and by the recipients is that when the Department of Social Welfare run out of benefits they are obliged to go to the health board for a new allowance. Of course, the classic example is the disability benefit and the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  People who no longer qualify for disability benefit have to apply to the health board for a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  They may be left for many weeks without support.</P>
    <P>All these benefits should continue to be administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  Indeed, the disabled person's maintenance allowance should be taken over by the Department of Social Welfare.  I believe legislation introduced in recent years would allow for this.  Such a move would make sense as the Department already administer an unemployment benefit system, an unemployment allowance for people who do not qualify on their contributions and a disability benefit.  However, there is no disabled person's maintenance allowance. <Col N="211" /> It would be much better from the point of view of the recipient if there was an integrated service and system of supports rather than having two Departments administering different supports. This is a good scheme although we would like it to be improved.  The Minister should strongly consider integrating the various support mechanisms in his Department instead of dividing them between the health boards and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how good our nursing and geriatric homes are, the quality of life which aged parents receive in their homes is far superior to anything elsewhere.  A characteristic of our society is that, irrespective of the size of the family, when a parent has to be cared for the responsibility is always left to one member of that family.  Other members come on a Sunday but they never take on full responsibility for the care of a parent.  The carer can often be a single daughter who gives up her job to look after an aged parent.  That is the finest kind of carer there is, someone who is prepared to make the sacrifice of giving up her job to look after an aged parent. They often forfeit their right to marriage because they have to look after a parent and they do not have the same freedom as other members of the family to engage in pursuits which they enjoy.  If people make sacrifices to look after an aged parent the Minister should respond by ensuring that the social welfare system is less rigid in monitoring the amount of money payable to the carer.</P>

      <P>We do not need stewards, he is a winner.  The Minister has shown openness, frankness and initiative, he is the person most likely to introduce a radical dimension to any ministerial post he may fill.  There is none better to start with than the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>When the carer's allowance was introduced it was welcomed by every Deputy. Unfortunately, it has turned out to be a three card trick.  The numbers availing of it are derisory and show it to be a sham. I recently suffered a bereavement before which I saw at first hand the amount of work necessary in looking after an aged parent.  He had to be turned every four hours on a 24-hour basis until he died and it showed the stark reality of the difficulties of caring for aged people. Geriatric hospitals are totally inadequate to care for people and the carer's allowance is crying out to be redressed.  It should not be means-tested for average earners; the cost of care, perhaps on a 24-hour basis, is above the means of the average family.  The prices asked by private nursing homes are also, in most cases, totally prohibitive.  Help should be given to almost every family caring for an aged parent or relative because very often professional help is needed to look after them, sometimes during the night. In most families this poses strain, financially as well as physically and many families have to club together to pay the care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told from time to time of the extraordinary cost of occupying a hospital bed.  Figures range from £300 to £700 per week, it is unbelievable and I do not understand that system of accountancy.  I know at least 20 people in their eighties whose families are seeking to place them in geriatric hospitals. They have cared for them lovingly for many years, through their sixties, seventies and into their eighties but there comes a stage when professional help is needed.  Very often, they must wait until someone dies before there is a chance of <Col N="213" /> a bed.  The waiting list in geriatric cases runs into thousands and yet we hand out huge amounts of money from the national lottery to affluent golf, rugby, soccer and GAA clubs instead of providing money for the health services and the carer's allowance which would enable people to look after their relatives at home.  The high earner can be subjected to means-testing but a concession should be made in relation to the average earner, particularly when there is a need for nursing at night for which private nurses must be paid.</P>
    <P>The concept of the carer's allowance is a very good one and commendable but its implementation is wrong.  It's too rigid. There is a need for a degree of flexibility in this worthwhile scheme.  If, as Deputy Connaughton suggested, a small payment was made it would perhaps encourage more people to look after their aged relatives at home.  I ask the Minister to look at this scheme, make it more flexible and include more people in this payment. The scheme should be maintained and enhanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A short time ago we were talking about the family income supplement, targeted at low paid families, which was not being availed of.  The Minister and his team continue to wonder why it has not been taken up to the extent it should.  There is a pool of people eligible for this scheme who have not applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complete opposite is the case in relation to the carer's allowance.  When the carer's allowance was first introduced people applied in their droves.  I remember when the former Minister introduced it he almost did a whistle stop tour of the country to announce to all and sundry at press conferences, on radio and television and to all elements of the media that he was a great Minister who was now introducing progressive legislation, unlike the legislation brought in by this Minister which is regressive to an extreme degree.  The then Minister envisaged a take-up rate in excess of 8,000. Following the publicity, 8,400 people applied in October 1991 for the carer's allowance.  It appeared that the Minister <Col N="214" /> was very near the mark because he had estimated that 8,000 people would benefit under the scheme.  Whereas 8,400 people applied for the allowance, fewer than half were eligible &mdash; so much for the number who we believed would benefit under the scheme.  The criteria for eligibility and the means test were so rigidly applied that only 1,613 people were awarded the allowance in full.</P>
    <P>Both the family income supplement and the carer's allowance schemes are failures because the take-up rate is so low.  The present Minister said last week that it would be better to transfer the scheme to the Department of Health because it was not operating successfully under his Department.  I do not agree that the scheme should be administered by the Department of Health but the Minister should make his name by ensuring that the scheme works so that more people benefit from it.</P>
    <P>We must remember that Ireland is a the crossroads.  We know how expensive it is to care for the elderly.  Thousands of people make daily sacrifices on behalf of elderly family members.  It should be recognised that if they did not care for their elderly relatives, the State would have to ensure they were cared for. Private nursing home care is very expensive and it is very difficult to get a place in a health board geriatric home.  I believe we are at a crisis point.  We read reports of elderly people being dumped on the streets in Japan and recently in the United Kingdom because their relatives were so distraught at trying to care for them and they could not find a place in either a hospital or home, private or public, where they would be taken care of.  Some elderly people were literally taken out in their wheelchairs and abandoned on the high streets of London. The same thing is happening in Tokyo.  I would not like to see the situation reaching this point here but we should be conscious of the international developments and do all we can to prevent something similar happening.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely scandalous that only 1,613 are in receipt of the carer's allowance in full and 1,972 are in receipt of a <Col N="215" /> reduced allowance.  Some carers are being paid the paltry sum of £3 per week for caring for somebody under this scheme.  It must be remembered that in order to be eligible for the allowance one must be caring for the person on a full-time basis.  It is therefore, quite insulting to pay somebody £3 a week.  The Minister should provide a minimum payment to all those eligible under the scheme.  The minimum payable to those eligible for unemployment allowance is £5 and we proposed raising that to £10 but the Minister failed to take that suggestion on board.</P>
    <P>This gives the Minister the opportunity to make a name for himself.  There should be a minimum payment of £30 per week to anybody eligible for a carer's allowance. The Minister should agree to change the working of the scheme.  It is primarily directed at those caring for pensioners who are 66 years or over.  I know that those caring for DPMA recipients are now eligible but I doubt if the scheme ever got off the ground.  When one considers that this scheme replaced the prescribed relative's allowance and yet only 1,613 are being paid the allowance in full, this scheme is a total and absolute sham.  Let me make three suggestions.  The Minister should broaden the range of people deemed to be eligible.  The person being cared for has to be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention but the scheme is limited to carers looking after old age pensioners, persons aged 65 in receipt of a retirement pension or persons in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  This age limit is too high because the Carer's Association of Ireland estimate that there are nearly 65,000 women engaged in caring for the handicapped, the elderly and others. They claim that 25,000 carers are providing care on a full-time basis.  If 25,000 people are providing care on a full-time basis and yet fewer than 2,000 are in receipt of the full allowance, this is frightening. It highlights the need for reform of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The means test is excluding many <Col N="216" /> carers.  It is absolutely outrageous that income in excess of £2 per week is assessed as means.  While this is essentially a good scheme the conditions that have to be met are brutal and as a result fewer than 2,000 carers are benefiting in full from the scheme.  The residential qualifications also disqualify people from benefiting under the scheme.  If memory serves me right, the person being cared for has to live with the carer and this is a further restriction on the scheme.  To summarise the means test, the residential requirement and the age profile serve to disqualify people from the scheme.  If we could broaden either one or all of these conditions, a greater number could benefit under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Whereas the Minister has asserted that he is in favour of protecting the rights of carers, the irony is that in another section he is effectively discriminating against home help who play such an important role in caring for elderly incapacitated or ill people on a daily basis.  If a home help who does one or two days work is in receipt of unemployment assistance, the wages the person receives for the one or two days insurable employment would be assessed as means when deciding on the level of unemployment assistance.  This will squeeze out the part-time home helps from the system.  I ask the Minister to re-examine this.  Again I suggest that he broaden the age profile, the residential qualifications and the means test that apply to the carer's allowance as this would considerably improve the scheme.</P>

      <P>In winding up on Second Stage and on Committee Stage I spoke about the carer's allowance. Before I became Minister for Social Welfare I had much to say about the carer's allowance.  People who have listened to the debate over the last week or so will be aware of what I have said.  At the recent party conference I also spoke about the carer's allowance.  I share the same view as Deputy Connaughton. Many people from Deputy Connaughton's constituency came in the thirties, forties and fifties to the part of Kildare in which I live.  There is a great <Col N="217" /> tradition, particularly among those from the west that people are cared for well into their eighties and nineties.  I know of many houses in my locality where people who have celebrated their 92nd and 93rd birthdays are still there.  It is a particularly west of Ireland farming tradition to look after the old.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a Kildare tradition too, but it is particularly strong in the country.  As I have said on previous occasions, the principle of a carer's allowance is an excellent one.  It would be as well not to have started it if we are not going to do it well.  I remember well the day the carer's allowance was announced because it was announced in the budget speech.  It is possible that the present Taoiseach announced it but it was the idea of the Minister for Social Welfare. The principle of establishing it and getting a foot in the door was a very good one.  I, too, welcomed it and we were inundated for weeks afterwards with questions from health boards and so on as to when the conditions would be announced and how it would operate. When it was made known how it would operate it caused much more political trouble than any kudos we got from the announcement in the first place.  On the principle that one can do worse politically by giving the people an expectation of something and not providing it, one would be better off not to tell them in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, my view of the carer's allowance is that if we were to call it by that name, it should mean that.  In effect, it replaced the prescribed relative's allowance.  When people are given an impression and an expectation of something which cannot be delivered it is a sure recipe for political disaster.  My idea of a carer's allowance is the same as that of many other Deputies who have contributed here this evening.  I would go further than Deputy McGahon and say why have a means test.  The biggest growth industry in my constituency is <Col N="218" /> private nursing homes to look after the old.  I do not know what the position is in Deputy Connaughton's constituency or in the north-east.  I can inform the House &mdash; and my colleague Deputy Stagg will support me &mdash; that in County Kildare, where there were one or two homes ten years ago, there are approximately 25 now.  Statistics will prove that people are living longer.  We will have a dependent population.  I am afraid and whether Deputy Connaughton and I like it or not &mdash; I do not like it &mdash; the tradition of the family looking after their old is disappearing.  As another Deputy pointed out, some people never get an opportunity of living their lives until the old person passes on.  I know of many hundreds of cases where single women and married women with children do not have that opportunity until the old person dies. If that is going to be the case in years to come then, as I advocated, on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, if we are to have a carer's allowance it must be a carer's allowance.  In my opinion it is a matter of taking the resources of the State from a number of different Departments and putting them together to give a proper carer's allowance to those people.</P>
    <P>As Deputy John Browne said, the cost to the State of keeping people in homes funded by the State is inordinate; it is costing hundreds of millions of pounds. As I said on previous occasions it would be better to give a small amount of money to a lot of people and then we would save the State vast sums of money over a number of years.  I committed myself earlier to saying I would look again at the carer's allowance.  I also queried why it comes within the ambit of the Department of Social Welfare.  Is it not a health matter and should it not properly be regarded as a health matter?  It is a great idea but if we are to operate it properly it should be done by the Department of Health.  There would be no point in the Department of Health operating it either if sufficient resources were not available. If we are not going to put the resources into it we could give it to the Department of Industry and Commerce and it still would not work effectively.  I will initiate <Col N="219" /> discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Health, in the coming year to see whether we can pool resources and say this is how it will be done in the future. It does not make any difference which Department is responsible for it; I have no hang-ups about having it in the Department of Social Welfare.  I could not disagree with many views expressed here tonight.</P>
    <P>I will examine the matter referred to by Deputy Browne of one carer looking after two carees.  He said my predecessor, Deputy Woods, gave a commitment in that regard, that he might be able to do something.  I do not know why it has not been done in the meantime but it is probably for cost reasons.  I do not imagine the cost would be enormous. Since becoming Minister for Social Welfare I have read a fair amount of material about the carer's allowance.  The carer's allowance was announced with a great deal of ballyhoo and ruaille buaille.  We created this great idea, but it was not great in the long term when people found they could not get it.  At that time nobody in the Department knew the statistics and who could claim.  The allowance was restricted so much that one would almost have had to be starving before one could qualify.  I am not going to defend the indefensible now that I am in the Department. Perhaps my predecessor was correct; he got his foot in the door to establish the principle and that is the basis on which we will try to work forward.</P>
    <P>With my colleague, the Minister for Health, I will try to evaluate the actual costs that would be saved by the State.  I think &mdash; and I have said this previously at Question Time &mdash; that there would be a massive saving to the State.  A lot of people throughout the country would take care of their old people rather than put them into homes funded by the State. It is getting to the stage, as various Deputies said, when we will have to recognise that in years to come there will be an enormous health problem in this regard and we will not have the carers unless we have a vast programme.  If we have to go down that road it will cost <Col N="220" /> the State hundreds of millions of pounds whereas the total cost of the carer's allowance this year is only about £10.4 million. The cost to the State in years to come could be of the order of £1 billion; I am not sure what it would be in 1992 terms. As I have said, that is what I intend to do this year in relation to the carer's allowance.  I have initiated discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon mentioned the need for a more integrated system.  As the House is aware, one of my main aims in the Department is to have such a system covering all welfare payments.  While Deputy Byrne did not agree with some of the things I said during the past few weeks he agrees with us in that regard. He suggested that the DPMA scheme would be the equivalent of a disability allowance scheme in my Department. While we have a disability benefit scheme in the Department there is no disability allowance scheme.  He suggested that the matter should more properly be dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>However we would not be anxious to consider this suggestion &mdash; let us say I am glad that the health boards and the Department of Health administer the DPMA scheme rather than the Department of Social Welfare.  We would not be anxious to administer a scheme which would give us a headache.  Having said that, however, it would be hard to stand against the principle on the grounds that it would be the equivalent of a disability allowance scheme.  Indeed, I said last week that I did not want to be seen as a Minister who introduced new schemes in my Department.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to look at it and possibly my Department will end up operating the DPMA scheme with the Department of Health operating the carer's allowance scheme.  However we would have to give the matter some thought.</P>
    <P>On both Second Stage and Committee Stage Deputy Fennell mentioned the need to provide a respite care scheme. The idea interests me in relation to those <Col N="221" /> who care for old people for 50 weeks of the year.  Surely they are entitled to a break for two weeks?  I might mention that people who care for handicapped persons at home in my constituency are given the opportunity by homes in County Kildare to take a holiday.  I think that is what the Deputy has in mind. As against this, pressure is increasing to provide beds for old people and the matter may become serious.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon mentioned the means test and I agree with him.  If we recognise the caring principle and a person devotes all his or her time to looking after an old person, who is an invalid, and has not placed that person in a home I would be inclined to go further in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Connaughton will not press his amendment to a vote because it would delete section 36 of the Bill, which, as the House is aware, will extend the carer's allowance to cover the recipients of invalidity pension transferred to retirement pension on reaching the age of 65 because of the higher rate of payment available.  I am aware that it is not his intention to do away with the concession being granted here and that his only purpose was to initiate a debate.</P>
    <P>In relation to each of the matters mentioned by Deputy Byrne there would be additional costs and until I examine the carer's allowance scheme and discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Health, to see if it can be viewed in a different way, I will not commit myself. As the Deputy is aware, I have no more money to spend.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the number of full time carers and the benefit of the scheme to the State in the years to come as people receive more money for looking after old people rather than placing them in the care of the State.  The Deputy estimated that there are 25,000 full time carers and between 60,000 to 65,000 carers in all.  At 31 January 1992 a total of 4,232 persons were awarded the carer's allowance of which 2,224 were granted the allowance at the full rate and 2,008 at a reduced rate.  If the Deputy's figure of <Col N="222" /> 65,000 carers in the country is correct, given that only 2,224 have been granted the allowance at the full rate and 2,008 at a reduced rate, the vast majority of carers are not getting anything from the State.  This also means that if an allowance was payable there would be substantial additional costs.  What I hope to do is to consider the matter in the context of the overall cost to the State.</P>

      <P>For the reasons I gave earlier when I moved the amendment, I will not press it to a vote, but it was the only mechanism available to me to initiate a discussion.  I think everyone would agree that this was one of the better discussions we have had.  While I cannot disagree with the Minister in relation to the views he has expressed, there is a responsibility on him and on the House to ensure that this becomes a reality.  Action will have to be taken from now on because, as I said, many people are frustrated and anxious and they would like to see changes made.  We will all be looking to the Minister during the next few months and year to see what changes are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 54, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until a motion approving of each draft has been passed by each such House.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech said it was announced on the publication of the 1992 Estimates in December last that the Government had decided that responsibility for short term sickness payments should be transferred to employers through a scheme of statutory sick pay. He went on to say that in order for employers to participate in this type of <Col N="223" /> arrangement the rates of benefit required to be simplified and streamlined and that the continuation of pay-related benefit would not be possible in the context of a statutory sick pay scheme.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that section 41 empowers the Minister to make regulations delegating certain administrative functions of the Department of Social Welfare to other organisations to be prescribed.  The Minister will surely tell me, if I am jumping the gun and reading too much into section 41 and the statement he made in his speech, that once regulations are made employers will pay disability benefit to their employees; but if that is the case the Minister is going down the wrong road. Our amendment reads:</P>
    <P>Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until a motion approving of each draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>One of the features of this Bill is that regulations will have to be made to implement what the Minister has in mind and what cannot be discussed on the floor of the House.  The number of regulations required under this Bill could result in a document as big as this Bill, substantial as it is, being produced.  We are only half debating this Bill.  We cannot get to the nitty gritty, the finer points which are in the Minister's head.  I am very disturbed about what the Minister intends putting into regulations.  The House should be able to debate the ideas which will be transferred into regulations.</P>
    <P>It would be a disaster to allow employers pay short term sickness payments to workers.  Is not the Minister familiar with what happened in Great Britain?  Four separate evaluations of a similar scheme in the United Kingdom led to the conclusion that far from saving money for the State the scheme involved additional cost, through increased staffing to administer it and the subsidisation of employers sick pay costs, for example <Col N="224" /> payment to employers who already operate sick pay schemes.  Given the British experience, we should ensure that any regulations the Minister intends making and any powers he intends to devolve on employers can be thoroughly analysed and debated here.  Allowing employers in Great Britain to pay sickness benefits led to increased fraudulent activity on their part.  Non-unionised workers, young workers, women and part-time workers had great difficulty in getting benefit from unscrupulous employers.  It is not a step in the right direction to entrust to employers the task of guaranteeing weekly sick payments to vulnerable workers.  In small enterprises which are not strongly organised by unions or management, the intimacy of the workplace can be very intimidating and a person who might genuinely be ill and who would wish to take time off work could find&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be entitled to conclude.  He is the only Deputy entitled to make two contributions by virtue of the fact that the Deputy moved the amendment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The section concerns the administration of social welfare schemes and the regulations required.  The regulations will implement the provisions of the Bill.  The amendment seeks to have the regulations placed before the House in the form of a motion which must be passed by the House before they come into effect.  I strongly support that proposal. The practice in the Department of Social Welfare, and in other Departments, has been to use the regulation system to implement black aspects of legislation, the politically undesirable aspects hidden in a Bill.  This is a secretive stealthy way to bring into force new regulations that affect people.  This House has no effective means of discussing quite substantive changes that affect people. The old system whereby regulations were placed in the Library of the House and a Member could bring the regulation before the House in the form of a motion has gone by the board.  The rules of the House have been changed and Private Members' time must be available within 21 sitting days of the making of the regulation in order to bring the matter before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment would have the effect of giving authority back to this House and taking it away, not necessarily from the Minister but from his officials who have an immense amount of authority, given the convoluted language they use in the regulations.  One would need a barrister to interpret them, never mind somebody who is unemployed and, perhaps, illiterate.  I know a fair bit about social welfare, from practice and when I get copies of regulations from the <Col N="226" /> Department I have great difficulty in understanding what they mean.  It would be good if such regulations had to be laid before this House.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the Minister will be required to make regulations concerning the new means test for unemployment assistance.  Under the new regulations if somebody on unemployment assistance gets a day's work and signs off, he will lose two days pay, so he cannot under any circumstances take part-time work. That is an outrageous new poverty trap created by the regulations the Minister must introduce to implement unemployment assistance under this Bill.  We will not have any opportunity to debate that regressive step which means that the long term unemployed will be effectively excluded from taking up insured part-time work.  Up to now the person who worked one day lost one day's benefit; the day's wages were in lieu of the benefit. Now one will be means-tested against the other days by the wages one earned on the day one worked.  That is a new poverty trap and it will be implemented by regulations without this House having any say in the matter.  The amendment will give this House the authority to express its opinion.</P>

The Minister may have as much ability as any of us and perhaps more than many of us. <Col N="227" /> He is, however, taking to himself the power to make decisions which we cannot discuss.  There are several matters which need to be teased out, including the problem of dental and optical care for people earning over £25,000 a year.  There is also the question of the self-employed and the carer's allowance scheme.  All these matters can be dealt with by way of regulation. Because the Minister has not accepted publicly any changes we have proposed, I have written the following verse: O Minister, my Minister, this Social Bill is through, The problems we discussed, I know, were hardly new to you, But yet you baulked our every try as we explained the flaws, and so it seems we'll once again bring forward muddled laws, Unless you bring in regulations that suit us and that we can approve.</P>

      <P>I, too, am concerned about ministerial authority being exercised by way of regulation.  Ministers have given as a reason for not telling the Dáil all the details on certain matters that they had to negotiate with outside bodies. That is the way Government works and I have no objection, but the buck should stop here.  The Minister should come back to the House and tell us exactly the reasons for his actions.  The Minister may want to talk to the employers and the unions on, for instance, the case of spouses who will not be entitled to optical and dental benefit.  I asked at an earlier point in the debate what would happen in the case of two spouses both earning £24,000.  Perhaps the Minister would answer that question when he has spoken to people outside the House but before the measure is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question arises regarding the penalty involving loss of unemployment benefit for up to nine weeks where a certain level of redundancy payment is received.  I want to know that level.  The <Col N="228" /> interested parties outside the House will have this information but I will not be aware of it.  This is the Chamber where we decide what will happen.  Perhaps it is a debate for another occasion.  I certainly support the amendment because we are the people who should decide these questions, after the interested parties have been consulted.</P>

It is desirable that those who are affected by this legislation from 6 April should know the impact it will have on them and their dependants.  Representations were made to me during the week in relation to redundancy payments.  In cases where redundancy payments have now been decided but will not be paid until after 6 April, will the recipients be caught in the nine weeks unemployment benefit trap? This is a major concern.  The level of redundancy above which this penalty comes into play will not be clearly demonstrated in the legislation.  The Minister might clarify the matter.</P>

The amount of redundancy money which will disqualify a person for up to nine weeks will be prescribed by regulation but it will be some time before we decide on that amount.  I must enter negotiations with the ICTU and the employers federation. This will not apply to anybody receiving a redundancy payment next week.  The enabling power is in the Bill and it will be utilised when agreement is secured and a decision is made.  The Deputy may be assured that it will take some time.</P>

Section 41 relates purely to administrative <Col N="229" /> matters in my Department. Deputy Stagg and Deputy Byrne are talking about the principle of regulations. There are sections in this Bill which give the Minister power to make regulations. Deputy Stagg raised a matter relating to unemployment assistance which is dealt with in section 27.

    <P>Deputy Byrne has gone off on a tangent in regard to statutory sick pay.  I announced on Second Stage the Government's decision to have a statutory sick pay scheme.  I spoke on Committee Stage about such a scheme and doing away with pay-related benefit and disability benefit. A statutory sick pay scheme will be the subject of a Bill before this House, when <Col N="230" /> the Deputy will have ample opportunity to make his case.  We will be taking on board some of the ideas expressed by Deputies in this regard.  The idea of a statutory sick pay scheme was first mooted in 1987 but we have yet to do anything about it.  I hope to prepare a statutory sick pay scheme this year and Deputies will have ample opportunity of speaking about the matter at that stage. Therefore, there is no need to be concerned about it now.</P>

    <Title>Private Member's Business. - Tallaght (Dublin) New Hospital: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy R. Bruton on Tuesday, 31 March 1992:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the decision to again postpone the commencement of the Tallaght Regional Teaching Hospital; requests that the Kennedy Group complete the Interm Report on Tallaght Hospital at the earliest possible date; and resolves itself to be of the opinion that the necessary capital should be set aside to commence building work in 1992.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on Amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" />&ldquo;welcomes the commitment of the Government to the Tallaght Hospital Project and supports its initiative in commissioning the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group to review and make recommendations on the functions, scope, scale and funding of the proposed Tallaght Hospital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Health).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned last night I had referred to the fact that £8.7 million has already been spent on the development of the Tallaght Hospital, going into site preparation, the preparation of detailed drawings, plans and so on.  I wish to remind the House that in December 1988 this House debated Tallaght at length in the course of a Private Members' motion moved by the Labour Party, when the House was asked to declare its concern about the microcosm of disadvantage that Tallaght represented and to establish a special programme to address and resolve a range of highlighted problems.  I should now like to quote just a few of the contributions of Members of the present Government to that debate.</P>
      <P>Minister Flynn, who was Minister for the Environment at the time, in the course of his contribution to that debate, stated at column 471, volume 385, of the Official Report of 6 December 1988:</P>
      <P>This Government are committed to the Tallaght Hospital project and approval has recently issued to the board to proceed to Stage 4 of the planning process.  It is anticipated that if the present rate of progress is maintined construction work will commence in mid-1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know what happened.  In fact, if the present rate of progress is maintained Tallaght will never get a hospital.  Now that Minister Flynn is a senior member of the present Government, I can only express the hope that he will add his voice to the legitimate demands of the people of Tallaght in order to make good on that <Col N="234" /> promise which he made in this House four years ago.</P>
    <P>Minister Harney also spoke in that debate.  She was, of course, in Opposition then and might not wish to be reminded of some of the things she said.  Nevertheless, they are worthy of repetition.  At column 774 of the Official Report of 7 December 1988, she said:</P>
    <P>As somebody who has sat on both sides of this House in my six years since becoming a Member of Dáil Éireann it seems to me that when people move from the Government side to the Opposition side suddenly they can find the penance for all Tallaght's ills and nothing is impossible.  Tallaght, for its size, has never been given any recognition by any Government in this country.</P>
    <P>At column 777 the Minister made the further comment &mdash; column 777 &mdash; and how prophetic it was:</P>
    <P>Not until such time as there is at the Cabinet table &mdash; and I do not mind who is in power &mdash; somebody who represents the area will Tallaght get the kind of resources it deserves.</P>
    <P>Speaking specifically about the provision of a hospital, Minister Harney told the Dáil that night that she could think of no more worthy project for Structural Funds than the building of a hospital and other much-needed facilities in Tallaght.  She added that if Structural Fund moneys were not available, then the Government should borrow the money &mdash; she even specified the bank from which it should be borrowed &mdash; and repay it over a period of years.</P>
    <P>At column 779 of the Official Report of 7 December 1988, she concluded:</P>
    <P>The country is not so badly off that it cannot afford that level of finance. We must have a determination and a commitment to help deprived and disadvantaged areas like Tallaght.</P>
    <P>No one could disagree with that sentiment. But the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy <Col N="235" /> Harney, has now been in Government for three years, close to the Cabinet table while all that has happened to the hole in the ground that should be the Tallaght Hospital is that the weeds grow higher there by the year.  It is no good coming into the House replying to questions saying: I support this project; I am committed to this project; it will be done; it cannot be done now, that kind of response is of no interest or value to the people of Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Such promises have been given over the years.  I suppose two or three times a year questions have been tabled by myself and other Deputies to the Minister for Health asking: what about it?  The reply keeps on being given that the Government are committed to the Tallaght Hospital.  But where is it?  Where is the beef?  Why do the Government not do what the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, told them to do away back in 1988, go out and borrow the money for this worthwhile project?  That is much to be advocated when one considers some of the far less deserving or worthwhile projects on which money is spent and has been borrowed over the years.  What more worthwhile project than this could there be?  The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, gave them the correct advice back in 1988.  Why now does she, along with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, not insist that the money is provided, in some measure, to get the Tallaght Hospital project under way?</P>
    <P>The complaint is made that the project will cost £118 million; that was not always so.  At the end of 1987 I tabled a parliamentary question to the then Minister for Health and the reply was to the effect that the development of the hospital was to take place on a phased basis, that initial site works were in course of completion, that detailed planning would be completed by the end of 1988 &mdash; the first phase of the development having about 450 beds and expected to be completed in 1992-1993.  It was said that the estimated cost of that phase was £43 million of thich approximately £3 million had been spent <Col N="236" /> up to that date.  Therefore, the then estimate for the hospital of 450 beds was £40 million.  Now, because of the delay, it is £118 million.  If we do not get on with it now and quickly the £118 million will escalate as time goes on, when the problem will appear even greater.  That is why it is of the utmost importance there be no further delay on this project.</P>
    <P>Tallaght is entitled to this hospital by reason of its size alone.  Comparisons have been drawn with Limerick and other areas.  It is the one remaining huge conurbation in this country that does not have the basic, essential facility of a hospital, which is needed nowhere more than in Tallaght.  There are so many people living there, women in particular, who suffer grievously as a result of the appalling expense and, in many cases, risk to life involved in having to take one or two buses or other transport into the city to seek hospital treatment in out-patients departments, already overcrowded or to have operations performed for which the waiting lists are already too long.</P>
    <P>In 35 years Tallaght has grown from being a village in the foothills of Dublin, with a population then of approximately 400, to a major conurbation, bigger than any other city in this State with the exception of Dublin and Cork.  If the people of Cork or Limerick were treated in the manner the people of Tallaght are treated, no Government could survive the outrage.  A Cheann Comhairle, you and other Members of this House will recall the uproar and mayhem created here when it was suggested that one of three hospitals in Limerick might be closed, although Limerick has a lesser population than Tallaght, all hell broke loose; yet we cannot get the building and construction of this project under way, promised for so long.</P>
    <P>For all too long the people of Tallaght have been patronised, on the one hand and, on the other ignored.  This has to stop and stop now.  Now is the time we require and must insist on the implementation of the commitment given to the people of Tallaght.</P>

      <P>I am very glad of the opportunity afforded me by Deputy Richard Bruton to speak about the proposed Tallaght Hospital.  Before responding to a number of specific points raised by Deputies, I should like to place on record my position and that of the Government in relation to this project. First and foremost, we are totally committed to the provision of a hospital in Tallaght at the earliest possible date.  Our commitment has never wavered.  I can assure the House of that.</P>
      <P>I should like to digress for a moment, having listened to Deputy Taylor for whom I have great regard and having been a party colleague of his over so many years.  Here I am not trying to score political points but I would say to Deputy Taylor: remember the Tallaght project has been there since 1981; the Tallaght project was there when Deputy Taylor's party were in Government in 1981, and the Tallaght project was there from 1982 to 1987 during which period Deputy Taylor's party were in Government.  Deputy Taylor said he had tabled a parliamentary question in 1987 to the then Minister for Health.  But he did not ask a parliamentary question during the time his party formed part of the Coalition Government then in power.  Rather he tabled the parliamentary question immediately after that Coalition Government went out of office.  I can understand that because he himself was not a member of that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor himself was not a member of that Coalition Government &mdash; I must make that clear &mdash; but his party formed part of that Coalition Government.  I am not trying to score political points but it is very important to put the matter in perspective.  I mean no disrespect to Deputy Taylor; he himself was not a member of the then Government.</P>
      <P>I want to be very frank about the availability of funds.  The Tallaght Hospital project has been costed at £118 million. I did not cost it; I asked my Department to do so.  They made very detailed costings from a number of sources and have come up with this figure.  I might add that it will be the single biggest health project ever undertaken in the history of this State.  I take the point Deputy Taylor made about what the cost would have been had the project gone ahead earlier but, in real terms, it would not have been considerably less.  Deputies Richard Bruton and Taylor gave the impression last evening that all that was needed was £5 million to get the project started.  If that was all they wanted, we could get it started for a lot less.  Of course, that would be unrealistic and we would merely be dishonest to so claim.  In addition it would be irresponsible and, I contend, grossly unfair to the people of Tallaght to commence building not knowing when the balance of the funds would be available to complete the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the people in the area, people and their families I have known in Drimnagh, Crumlin, Kimmage, Ballyfermot and Walkinstown. I know how long they have awaited this vital amenity, how frustrated they are by the whole process, but I will not send in the bulldozers simply to placate them temporarily or to pretend that <Col N="239" /> things are finally on the move.  That would be dishonest.  No, when I start this project, I will ensure I have sufficient funds to finish it and finish it quickly.  That is the very least the people of Tallaght deserve.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton's suggestion that we allocate £5 million from this year's health capital budget is too simplistic. If I did not know him better I might even consider that suggestion a little mischievous.  I do not think he meant it to be.  He knows full well that our capital funds are already totally committed. Perhaps he feels there are hospital projects under way in other parts of the country less deserving that Tallaght. If that be so, I should be glad to hear from him.  I have examined the project in every conceivable way, and I wish it were possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor suggested that a Supplementary Estimate should be introduced to allow the project to commence this year.  However, I should like to ask where the balance of £113 million will come from.  These figures must be seen in the context of an annual health capital budget of £42 million. To push ahead with the Tallaght project we would need to put a stop to virtually every other hospital development for the next four years.  Is that what Deputy Taylor is suggesting?  A commitment has already been made to many of these projects and we have no way of stopping them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Deputy is suggesting that we should borrow more money.  Governments have been condemned for overborrowing. It would be irresponsible of us to ever again go down the road of excessive overborrowing.  The requirement on the Government is to achieve an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 1.5 per cent in 1993 and to make progress towards the general Government debt targets implicit in our membership of the European Monetary Union.  We have a <Col N="240" /> commitment to this Union and we must comply with the demands.  This makes the allocation of significantly increased capital resources to the health sector very problematic over the next few years.  We need to seek innovative solutions to the Tallaght Hospital funding problem. There are possible options and these must be fully explored.  The Dublin Hospital Advisory Group are examining the various possibilities and I look forward with interest to receiving their advice and recommendations in this area.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised too in relation to my comments about the size of the proposed hospital.  Much of what I have said in this regard has been misrepresented as a scaling down of the hospital.  This is clearly not the case.  I was very encouraged to hear some of the contributions made last night, particularly Deputy Bruton's contribution, which acknowledged that the changes in hospital practice and the advance in technology mean that we can now cater for the same throughput of patients with significantly fewer beds.  I did not invent this theory; it is a result of advancement in medicine.  Operations which took many days three to four years ago can now be carried out in one day.  Almost 50 per cent of surgical operations can now be done on a one day basis.  I did not dream up or lay down any rules.  Indeed, the modular system proposed allows for this. I did not step out of line; all I said to them was that they should look at this possibility.</P>
    <P>I was not aware that this was already provided for in the drawings for that hospital.  I do not wish to dwell on this point any further but I wish to point out for Deputy Taylor's information that the Tallaght Hospital Board now accept that it would be possible to adequately cater for the needs of the area with fewer beds than originally envisaged.  It is they who have said this.  I did not lay down any laws for them.  It would be very wrong of me to do that.  I said that they should merely look at the issue.  This is their thinking.  They were not responding to what I said; they thought of this on their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is correct.  I am surprised that this point was not mentioned previously.  As I said, they thought of this independently of me. The Deputy has my word of honour on this.  I merely said that we should look at the issue.  When I was checking the drawings this evening I found that they had already come up with this idea. Therefore, my idea was not original.  I do not have a monopoly on wisdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of beds which should be provided has yet to be determined.  There are not hard and fast rules about this issue.  This question is being examined in depth by the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group and I look forward to receiving their recommendations on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group are also examining the interim arrangements which might be put in place pending the completion of the hospital.  I recently discussed this matter with the Tallaght Community Council and the Tallaght Regional Hospital Action Group.  Both groups have adopted a very reasonable attitude to this matter and have been very patient.  I had discussions with the Meath Hospital about the matter two weeks ago.  I explained to both groups that even if the hospital were to start tomorrow it would be five or six years before the first patient could cross the threshold.  This is understandably frustrating to the four Deputies from the area.  In the meantime I am anxious to do what I can for the people in the Tallaght area, particularly for mothers with young children who are dependent on public transport to get them to hospital.  As I previously mentioned in the House, I have also asked the Meath Hospital to consider this matter in association with their colleagues in the <Col N="242" /> Adelaide Hospital and the National Children's Hospital and to let me have their recommendations as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>When I put this suggestion to them I was told that discussions on this matter had been ongoing for years.  As I said, the problem is that the discussions have gone on for too long.  I suggested that they come back with a proposal within two weeks.  I am awaiting their proposals on the matter.  It might be possible to do something in the short term in the area of outpatients, x-rays and blood tests.  I will look at the matter sympathetically. The general practitioners in the area, who have a very good knowledge of the problems there, believe that x-rays and blood tests should be available in the initial stages.  As I said, I will look at the matter sympathetically so as to give an assurance to the people of the area that the project will go ahead.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Adelaide Hospital and their future role in the Tallaght Hospital.  I should say at the outset that I have great admiration and respect for the Adelaide Hospital.  I have had a long association with that hospital.  As a nipper I visited their accident and emergency unit more often than anyone else.  I also had associations with the hospital as a student and patient.  I completed my final medical examination in the hospital. I know the hospital well and I have great regard for the wonderful consultants working there who have given a great service to the people of the area.  The hospital's reputation in the area of patient care has been well earned and richly deserved.  Since their foundation over 150 years ago the hospital have been recognised not just in Ireland but internationally for their pioneering work in medicine.</P>
    <P>I know that the Protestant community are concerned that the Adelaide Hospital's very distinctive tradition and ethos could be lost or in some way diminished if they are amalgamated with the Meath and the National Childrens' Hospitals and moved to a new location in Tallaght.  Indeed, the community at large would regret any such development. One has only to talk to the people <Col N="243" /> of the south inner city to appreciate how highly they value the Adelaide Hospital and how much they appreciate the quality of nursing and medical care which has always been their hallmark.  The Adelaide Hospital are renowned for their standards.  It is in all our interests to ensure that these standards are not only protected but are nurtured and fostered.</P>
    <P>When I suggested that the Adelaide Hospital might wish to remain in Peter Street apparently my motives were misunderstood. All I was saying is that they might consider such a move in order to protect their interests.  I also made the point that many hospitals in the inner city had closed down &mdash; for example, Sir Patrick Duns Hospital, Mercer's Hospital, Baggot Street Hospital and Steeven's Hospital.  There are very few hospitals in the inner city and I put it to them that they might wish to make such a move.  Whatever their wishes, they will be facilitated.  I think this clarifies the matter.  We should see to it that whatever they want is done.  They must be given this guarantee.  I should like to put it on the record that that is what I was thinking of when I made that suggestion.</P>
    <P>I am also mindful of the history and traditions of the Meath and National Childrens's Hospitals, both of which have made a significant contribution to the development of medicine in Ireland. These hospitals have a very special place in the hearts of the people in the south inner city.  If these hospitals move to Tallaght a paediatric section will be provided in the hospital.  This is part and parcel of the project.  As the Minister of State said last night, the challenge facing us is to ensure that all that is rich and valuable in the traditions of the three hospitals is successfully transferred to the new hospital in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The Kennedy group expect to report in six weeks.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, and I will bring their recommendations to the Government and I think we will get a sympathetic hearing. I should like to assure the people of Tallaght that there is no equivocation or vacillation on our part; they have my <Col N="244" /> assurance in that regard.  The Government are fully committed to the Tallaght Hospital project, the Adelaide ethos will be protected and, as soon as the report is available, we will submit it to the Government as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for Health for agreeing to give me some of his time.  I congratulate him on his appointment to his position.  I am not normally involved in debates on health in this House as I have responsibilities at the Department of the Environment.  Therefore, this is the first opportunity I have had in the House to compliment him on his appointment. Other people as well as myself are looking forward to great things from the Minister because, given his medical experience, that he is a Dubliner and has represented for many years in this House areas of huge disadvantage, he is in a unique position to understand the needs of the Tallaght area in relation to hospital services.</P>
      <P>Since the debate began there has been too much political squabbling.  It does not really matter tonight who did what and when; the fact remains that we do not have a hospital in Tallaght and until such time as resources are allocated we will not have a hospital in Tallaght.  Whether it was a Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour, a Fianna Fáil Government which we had from 1987 to 1989, or the present Coalition Government does not really matter; what matters is that the allocation of resources will be made so that Tallaght Hospital, which is required, gets under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Taylor that I have never made personal remarks in this House in relation to any Deputy's performance.  I have always chosen to concentrate on the Government of the day.  When Deputy Taylor was a back-bench Member during the term of the two Coalition Governments between 1981 and 1987, I never singled him out for criticism in relation to anything he might have done or said and I do not <Col N="245" /> intend to do so tonight.  To have a personalised political squabble in relation to this issue would be the very worst thing we could do.  I have not changed my views since 1988.  I stand over everything I said then and I will repeat it if Deputy Taylor is interested.  It is a fact that when Deputies from the Government benches of this House go to the Opposition, everything suddenly seems possible.  A long litany of things is called for.  I know political points are often scored, but I do not engage in that kind of politics and I will not do so tonight either.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, since 1980 it has not been possible for the State, or any Government in office during that time, to provide the necessary resources so that Tallaght Hospital could get under way. Up to 1987 a sum of £1.8 million was allocated to the Tallaght Hospital project and since then £6.8 million has been allocated to it.  It is only a drop in the ocean and a lot more needs to be done.  I want to concentrate tonight on what we might do to provide hospital services in the Tallaght area.  I acknowledge, as the Minister of State said last night, as the Minister said tonight and as is generally acknowledged in medical circles everywhere, that we have made enormous advances in medical practice.  New technology and microsurgery mean that, thankfully, many cases can be dealt with on a one day basis.  I welcome that because having a patient recovering at home with the family is always preferable to staying in hospital.  However, in acknowledging that, it should not and must not mean any scaling down.  What is required in Tallaght by way of bed compliment is what is needed there and if a specific number of beds is needed to deal with the health cases in the area then that number of beds must be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister for Health announced his intention to provide interim services in the Tallaght area because we all recognise that even if the Government provided resources in the morning it would take to the end of this decade before the first patient <Col N="246" /> entered Tallaght Hospital.  In the meantime we want the kind of intermediate services which would allow many of the individuals who have to travel by public transport to hospitals around the city for physiotherapy, pathology, blood, urine and sputum tests to have them carried out in Tallaght if possible.  I hope that following consultation between the three hospitals in the MANCH group it will be possible very soon to provide, as a basic minimum, a physiotherapy centre and a pathology centre in Tallaght.  I refer to a physiotherapy centre because people who are immobilised as a result of a fracture or break find it particularly difficult to travel on public transport.  The same applies to diabetes patients who may have to have a blood test every year; it takes maybe three hours to travel to and from the hospital for a test which takes about five minutes.  Obviously it would make sense to have those facilities in the area.  I would also like to think that we could have an X-ray facility although I accept that it is particularly expensive. Nonetheless, I hope we can provide the resources for it.</P>
    <P>I understand that the medical school in Trinity College &mdash; in not too large a room &mdash; have a modern, comprehensive physiotheraphy centre.  Even with relatively small resources we could provide such a facility in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>In relation to an out-patients casualty service, I would be concerned to ensure that any service would have the proper staff and that it would be more of a staging service so that an ambulance would be on call if difficult serious cases arose. My worry is that if there was a casualty out-patients facility at Tallaght many cases involving serious accident would be taken there where they could not be properly dealt with because operating theatres and so on would not be available. The kind of delay involved in first going to Tallaght, and then going on to the appropriate hospital could have serious implications for the patient. Therefore, I would be concerned that any out-patient facilities provided in Tallaght would have, as a minimum, obviously a casualty officer and the appropriate <Col N="247" /> complement of staff to make sure in particular that cases were dealt with appropriately and that there was always an ambulance on standby to take people to other hospitals if required.</P>
    <P>Great tributes were paid during this debate to the Adelaide Hospital and I join in these tributes.  I was a patient there some years ago and we could all speak very highly of it.  It is often not understood what the significance is of protecting the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital.  It was one of the first hospitals in this city to provide, for example, tubal ligation for women on a public patient basis.  At present University College Hospital, Galway, Victoria Hospital, Cork and, I think, the Rotunda now provide the service.  But until recently it was very difficult, if not impossible, to get this service except in the Adelaide Hospital for a woman who was not in a position to attend a hospital privately.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to funding options. I know that during the last round of the Structural Fund money was not available for health or education related projects except for education in the sense of technical training.  Under the Delors II package, which involves a doubling of Structural Funds to the four poorest regions of the Community &mdash; Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece &mdash; health and education matters will be covered.  I know that the doubling of the funds to the four poorest regions does not necessarily mean that there will be a doubling of the fund to Ireland.  However, if additional funds are available to Ireland, and if health and education are now being included for the first time, I hope the Government will make a strong case for resources to be provided for the building of Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>If the development of the Community is about anything and if the whole concept of cohesion funds to bring up the poorer regions to nearer the norm of the wealthier states means anything, areas of great disadvantage and need, like Tallaght, must get resources from the Structural Funds if we are to have a community where everybody has a fair opportunity <Col N="248" /> and access to health and education.  This is fundamental.</P>
    <P>I know I am probably running out of time but before I finish I would like to comment on the public perception of Tallaght. Deputy Fennell referred to the poor headlines that Tallaght often attracts.  This is a fact and it is most regretable. If anything has done much to improve its image it is the experience of the many people who may only have driven through Tallaght in the past but have since come to visit the square.  Many people who came to shop or to go to the cinema have been greatly impressed by the facilities there and the kind of place Tallaght is.  I represent a great many other areas but I must put on record &mdash; and it is unlikely to be challenged &mdash; that no other area of my constituency has the same kind of community spirit, the same level of community involvement right across the board, as Tallaght.  This is one of the fantastic things about the area.  If it was not for the community leaders, the residents groups, the community council and the people involved in all kinds of organisations in Tallaght, it would not be the kind of place that we all feel so proud to represent.  It is a great privilege to represent an area in this House, it is a particular privilege to represent an area of great need and disadvantage, an area which is new but has all the challenges and opportunities that go with that.  This new area needs and deserves the type of facilities which would allow it to become a town in the real sense.</P>
    <P>We now have the facilities at the Square, a variety of fantastic schools, the regional technical college will open this year and what is really needed to complement the development of Tallaght is the new hospital and a proper transport service.  I hope to be part of the Government that will start that process in a real sense.  I do not wish to be part of a Government that either fuel expectations or make false promises because an election is in the air.  That would be doing a great disservice to the people of Tallaght who are in great need and suffer great disadvantage.  I do not want to see the types of ceremonies we have had in the <Col N="249" /> past.  I did not go to the famous sod turning ceremony because I saw it for what it was, a political PR sham, which it subsequently turned out to be.  We want no more of that and this Government will not be a party to any more PR exercises of this kind.</P>
    <P>What we need are resources to build a hospital and a firm commitment to the provision of those resources.  We really need now, at the beginning of 1992 &mdash; and I hope the Minister is in a position to provide this &mdash; is an intermediate service that will provide for mothers with young children, or people suffering from broken ankles or back injuries.  We need a service in Tallaght, that will alleviate much of the suffering and pain caused by having to travel to the city.</P>
    <P>This has been a particularly useful debate and I hope it will be productive. It is in all our interests, whether we are in Government or in Opposition &mdash; there are four Deputies for the Tallaght area &mdash; to work together for the provision of this hospital.  Of course the Government have a unique and special responsibility to come up with the funding for the hospital.  That will not be easy, no matter who is in power.  In addition to the capital sums required for the provision of the building there is the cost of staffing the hospital on a full-time annual basis.  I hope the Government will be in a position, whether through EC funding, from the national Exchequer or from whatever source to provide the resources to allow this hospital to begin in earnest over the next number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little time and there will be a great many things that I will not be able to say but it is worth while sharing time if it is only to emphasise the all-party approach to this problem.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, <Col N="250" /> for tabling this motion and giving us the opportunity to discuss it.</P>
      <P>I have a constituency interest, of course because my constituency is on the edge of Clondalkin but, even apart from that, anybody looking at the situation in the Tallaght-Clondalkin area would be acutely aware of the need for a new hospital in the area.  I am not sure where the catchment boundary area will be, but I assume the sensible thing would be to have the River Liffey as a boundary.  If that is the case I will have a greater interest in this matter because not only Clondalkin but Palmerstown and Lucan will be served by this hospital.</P>
      <P>Tallaght itself has a minimum population of 70,000 people and approximately 260,000 people live in the catchment area, so we are talking about facilities required by a population of over 300,000.  While Tallaght may not like it, my suggestion underlines the fact that it is not just Tallaght that is involved.  I dare not suggest that the hospital be called the &ldquo;Dublin West Hospital&rdquo;, because that would be too parochial, but what about the &ldquo;South-West Dublin Hospital&rdquo;?  This might receive a certain welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to record my appreciation of the other major hospital in the area, that is Blanchardstown hospital, which has provided a great service not only to the people of Dublin West but to Dublin people generally. Like others, I welcome the reassurance that has been given in relation to the Adelaide hospital in regard to the preservation and continuation of its distinctive traditions and ethos.  That distinctive tradition and ethos must be cherished and encouraged.  We are the better for it and long may it be the case. I have a particular example in mind when I think of the Adelaide and its future. From my previous political existence in the other part of this island, I recall the rows, hatred and passion generated over many years in connection with the Mater hospital in Belfast but now they play an extremely important role because a solution was found to their particular problem. They still preserve their ethos and tradition in war-torn Belfast and the two <Col N="251" /> communities are served by that hospital. All are served in a way they find satisfactory. If there is a problem the Minister could do worse than look at the history of the Mater hospital in Belfast and examine the arrangements that were made then and which evolved over the years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney referred to the public image of Tallaght.  I accept that this was a major problem for a considerable period of time.  I remember the first time I visited Tallaght I was amazed to find the public image of Tallaght was not the reality.  I could not understand why Tallaght had such a bad image in view of what I saw on my first and subsequent visits.  However, we have to recognise that Tallaght and Clondalkin are unfortunately areas of deep deprivation and disadvantage and this of course is an additional reason for urgent action. Other places the size of the Tallaght-Clondalkin area would have strong claims &mdash; indeed one could say unanswerable claims because of their population &mdash; but deprivation and disadvantage are additional reasons for a hospital in the Tallaght-Clondalkin area.  Disadvantage, deprivation, ill-health and poverty go hand in hand; one feeds on the other, one is a consequence of the other.  That is an additional reason for pressing ahead with the hospital in the Tallaght area.  It is unacceptable that the people of Tallaght, Clondalkin and adjoining areas have had to wait so long for their hospital in the same way as they have had to wait for other services such as third level education, shopping facilities, adequate public transport and the other facilities people have a right to expect in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity this evening of putting forward their claims.  Deputy Bruton told us that Fine Gael are pressing for a commitment of money in 1992 to start building.  It is not too much to ask that a commitment be given in terms of money because that is the only commitment that matters.  I hope, even at this late stage, the Minister <Col N="252" /> will be prepared to give that commitment. There is a great deal of cynicism, disillusionment and lack of faith among the people in the area because of the promises made over the years, irrespective of the political party who made those promises and of the political parties who were in office.  The people of Tallaght require more than a promise; they require a strong indication of the determination of the Government to proceed quickly.</P>
    <P>We should have sufficient political clout behind this demand.  Two Ministers of State are TDs in that constituency, and one of them is in the Department of Health.  There is sufficient political clout there to ensure that this hospital project is pushed forward quickly.  Certainly, this year there ought to be that determination.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware &mdash; I said this privately at the time of his appointment and publicly the other night &mdash; that he will either be a great Minister or a disaster; there can be no in between for him.  I hope he will be a great Minister and he has the potential to be one.  He has the experience to enable him to be a great Minister.  I know that is his aim.  I suggest he could make a fitting start this evening by making the required commitment to Tallaght.  There is much more I could say but I will leave it to my colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputy Currie for sharing his time with me.  I promise I will allow time for Deputy Lawlor.  I compliment Deputy Bruton on giving the House the opportunity again to debate this important issue.  The record of the House will show that in my maiden speech I raised the issue of the urgency of the Tallaght regional hospital.  With the possible exception of unemployment, it is the most pressing and important issue for the people who elected me in Tallaght, Clondalkin, Walkinstown, Rathcoole, and for the 250,000 people in the surrounding region.  In the intervening period I have consistently pressed successive Ministers, Deputies O'Hanlon, O'Rourke and O'Connell to provide the <Col N="253" /> funds to enable the hospital to commence. I would refer Deputies, for example, to my most recent speeches of 5 November, 13 and 19 December 1991. The remarkable thing about the Ministers replies &mdash; irrespective of the personality in office &mdash; is that the question of funding is missing.  Time and again I have been invited to listen to a recitation of the Government's performance elsewhere, their verbal commitment to the Tallaght project and how well they have done in other locations throughout the country but never has there been any provision for the missing link, finance to enable the hospital to start.</P>
      <P>I accept when resources are scarce, it is difficult to meet the demand for improved public services.  Politics, as far as I am concerned, is about making choices. Time and again in this House we have made choices about the allocation of funds that favour the better off sections in the community to the neglect of people in less well off areas of our society.  We pay lip service to equality and to a commitment to a fairer society.  Yet resources are frequently transmitted to the powerful and the rich in our society or to the better off areas while new less well off areas struggling to become established are neglected.</P>
      <P>Thus we have in the case referred to by Deputy Currie, a super rapid transport system serving the better off areas of south Dublin.  We have no such service in west Dublin.  Similarly in regard to education, the higher education grants system is specifically structured to assist the children of large families while children of the average PAYE earner in my constituency and that of Deputies Lawlor and Currie are assessed for higher education eligibility on a different basis.  Access to hospital care is to be more expensive and more difficult for those living in Tallaght or Clondalkin than for those living in Clonskeagh or Clontarf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Tallaght regional hospital, therefore, the Government have to make a choice.  When the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Rourke, asked me during the course of the debate on <Col N="254" /> her Health Estimate on 13 December where I proposed she would find the £6 million to enable hospital construction to commence in 1992, I reminded her that she managed to find £6 million with amazing alacrity when a site for a business school had to be taken off the hands of a well known developer at Carysfort.  The point I am making is that when the political will is there the money can be found.  The question for the Minister tonight is whether he has the political will to build the Tallaght hospital.  In my view he is politically committed to it. As Deputy Currie said, I cannot believe the Minister has forgotten all his training and the thoughts he has put on the record in the past about the necessity to deliver good quality patient and hospital care to deprived communities.  Unfortunately, we do not have any yardstick by which to measure his ability to deliver at Cabinet level.  It is on that issue, as Deputy Currie said, that he will stand or fall in realising his potential after all the years he sought this office.  One thing he can do that will have him remembered as Minister for Health is to enable construction of the Tallaght regional hospital to commence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to calling it the Dr. John O'Connell Memorial Hospital after he passes on.  The Minister has an additional reason.  Many of the people organising the careful protests in my constituency about the project are prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Even if they are a little less assertive than they might be if we had a Labour/Fine Gael Government their involvement is compelling evidence of the widespread support and demand throughout the community for this hospital.  Therefore, the Minister has a powerful political reason, as well as a social and regional one, to enable work on the hospital to commence.  I am reluctant to believe he has forgotten his own background. <Col N="255" /> The point Deputy Currie made concerning the Adelaide encompasses all I would want to say about that hospital. Last night, according to the unrevised version of the Official Report, I said the Minister had said he thought it a good idea if the Adelaide stayed where they were.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, replied: &ldquo;That is not true.&rdquo;  It is true and I want to read what the Minister said last Thursday in reply to a parliamentary question concerning the Adelaide. He said:</P>
      <P>I did suggest to the Adelaide Hospital &mdash; and I am not laying down laws &mdash; that they might consider remaining where they were providing a vital medical service in the inner city.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that a Minister for Health drops the suggestion that the Adelaide stay where they are as if he was some backbencher.  I imagine that were I on the board of the Adelaide and the Minister suggested to me that I should stay where I was, I would take a very definite meaning from that.  I think the Minister should have a word with his Minister of State and get his act together in relation to this matter because we cannot have the feeble effort that was made last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who suggested that maybe they will stay where they are and maybe they will not.</P>

      <P>The inherent wisdom of scaling down the hospital is recognised immediately by the Ministers of State, Deputy Harney and Deputy Flood, but I am not an expert and there may well be some argument in favour of it because there have been changes and developments in medicine.  Many people in the public gallery may not appreciate this but if the Minister makes a start this year on a 450-bed hospital in Tallaght my party will not oppose him.  However I would like to know why he was at some pains tonight to tell us that this was not just his idea, that it was the board who came up with the idea independently and that they have been thinking along those lines. Why were we not told about this before now?

      <P>Surely, he can tell the House what the American financiers were so enthusiastic about and what implications private funding will have in relation to the delivery of and access to patient care in Tallaght because we do not want a hospital that is funds-driven and is hungry for private patients at the expense of public patients who will be treated as second class citizens.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that I am using up some of Deputy Bruton's time and hope that I will be able, from the back benches on the Government side of the House, to echo some of the views that my colleagues in the Opposition would like to express.  This debate reminds me of the great arguments which took place in the House in regard to the provision of a town centre and a third level college in Tallaght.  There was a need for decisive and dramatic action and all the politicians who represented Tallaght and the surrounding areas cooperated with each other.  Construction on the town centre went ahead when tax incentives were provided and after great pressure had been exerted a third level college was provided.  All that remains to be provided is a hospital.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the strategic planners, from 1972 onwards, they drew up a cohesive plan but they have been criticised ever since for failing to complete the satellite towns.  Deputy Currie and I represent two of those satellite towns, Tallaght being the third.  I echo the points made by Deputy Currie in regard to the Tallaght Hospital.  It will also be the hospital of those living in the greater Clondalkin-Lucan area.  It will be a regional hospital to serve a population of close on 300,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the need to find innovative solutions to the problem of funding, as mentioned by the Minister in his speech, and regardless of how many reports are necessary from advisory groups or the Kennedy review group, I sincerely hope that the Minister will bring pressure to bear &mdash; I have full confidence in both him and his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Flood &mdash; to ensure that real progress is made in the provision of a regional hospital at the Tallaght site.  To echo the point made by Deputy Rabbitte it is essential, if a scaled down version is provided, having regard to advances made in medicine, that proper out-patients facilities are provided, to complement the services to be provided for the <Col N="259" /> north Clondalkin area at the Tallaght hospital.</P>
    <P>Those of us who represent areas which have been newly created have a responsibility to those areas.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, various projects have been proceeded with in areas which are already well healed and adequately served with regard to transport and other facilities. Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown are new towns which have been built on green field sites and, unfortunately, it is taking us far too long to catch up and to provide the basic facilities which are accepted as the norm in other parts of the country.  Because of budgetary constraints, we have to argue our case far more vigorously with consecutive Governments.</P>
    <P>I should also put it on the record that there is a task force whose function is to consider the difficulties which have arisen in urban areas.  Therefore in order to meet the demands of these areas and to tackle the difficulties which are beginning to be highlighted it is essential that a major regional hospital be provided. Therefore I vigorously support the calls which have been made to the Minister to place high on his agenda at Cabinet the question of providing funds to complete the Tallaght Regional Hospital.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased to allow other Deputies to contribute to this debate as this issue is the source of concern for everyone with an interest in Dublin.  So far as anyone who has represented Dublin is concerned, it is a scandal that while we have developed the outer suburbs we have left them denuded of basic facilities.  That point has been made very eloquently on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to recognise the long history of delays in relation to this project.  As the House is aware, the Tallaght Hospital <Col N="260" /> board were appointed in 1980 while the brief was completed in 1983.  The architects' competition was held in 1984 and an architect was appointed in 1985.  Detailed design plans were completed at the end of 1987 and it should be said that there were no delays on the part of the Coalition Government at any stage during the process.  The project was ready to go to tender in November 1990 but then it ground to a depressing halt.</P>
    <P>During the course of the general election campaign Fianna Fáil gave a firm commitment that the project would start in 1990.  Indeed, they accelerated the process to bring the project to the detailed final planning stage but once the dust had settled following the election fever the project was left languishing.  We therefore have to look with a jaundiced eye on their latest proposal to reappoint the Kennedy review group to reconsider the functions, scale and funding of the project.</P>
    <P>I say this advisedly because the Kennedy review group produced excellent recommendations on organisational structures for the Dublin region.  They proposed that in south-west Dublin a hospital providing comprehensive care should be built in south-west Dublin.  It would not leave the Adelaide Hospital behind as the Minister suggested in this debate.  It would be the focus of developing integration between the primary GP care and the community care services <i>in situ,</i> close to the people it was designed to serve.  The Minister and his predecessors knew that that was the whole basis of Kennedy and yet they engaged in the sham of asking Kennedy to look again at something he spent years studying, coming up with a blueprint for the Tallaght area and the other five regions. They asked Kennedy to look again at the functions of the Tallaght Hospital when he had spelt out in elaborate detail that its core function was to provide comprehensive care, not lacking any of the specialities, for the people of Dublin South West.</P>
    <P>The Minister is reintroducing a red herring when speaking again here tonight about the issue of scale of <Col N="261" /> hospital as something that needed very careful review.  When this project was originally drafted the idea was for a 600 bed unit; but it was always to be in phases, with phase one being for 450 beds.  In the middle of 1990 the Minister's predecessor agreed to the idea that the three phases should be brought together to make this a 600 bed unit that would cost the £118 million to which the Minister's predecessor so often referred in the House.  That was not the thinking of the Tallaght Hospital board captured in time and oblivious to the changes in trends in hospital care.  The Tallaght Hospital board knew better than we did how hospital care had been developing and how day care rather than long term stay care has become a feature of modern hospital care.  It was they who redesigned their needs and they are completely agreed that the 600 bed unit is not a priority now.  We did not need Kennedy to come up with that.  The Tallaght Hospital board knew it and I am glad that tonight the Minister has finally accepted that.  That at least is some progress. Neither the functions nor the scale of the hospital were issues for Kennedy to review.  We knew of the most modern thinking on those issues before this committee was appointed.</P>
    <P>The remaining issue was funding.  I am sad that there seems to be no hope of imaginative thinking in the two ministerial heads across the floor.  We know a lot of the facts even without having a committee.  We know that leasing will be dearer for the taxpayer in the long run than funding by State borrowing, and any suggestion that we can make this cheaper is wrong.  We know that EC Structural Funds, to which the Minister, Deputy Harney, rightly referred as offering some opportunity for us, come to us through the Minister and not through the Kennedy Committee.  That will come to us through the Minister's ability to use the Maastricht Treaty to get support from our EC partners for care, particularly care in a deprived part of the city.  I do not have time to go through the Maastricht Treaty as it refers to health, but there is obviously <Col N="262" /> hope in this Treaty.  But it is not the Kennedy group that will bring those funds home to us; it is the Minister across the Chamber.  Funding for an organisation like the VHI comes through the Minister and not through the Kennedy group.  If new imaginative sources of funding are to be provided out of private funds to finance a privately managed hospital, it will not be the hospital we want to see, and I am glad that the Minister has agreed that that is not the sort of hospital we want to see for the people of Tallaght and the surrounding areas of Dublin South-West, Wicklow and Kildare.  The only message that came across from the two ministerial speeches last night and tonight was that none of the £42 million to be spent this year on hospital projects will be devoted to Tallaght.  Money will not be set aside to start this project in 1992.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by the Minister of State last night, and re-echoed by the Minister tonight, that as soon as the Kennedy report is completed it will be on the Cabinet table is a hollow promise when the Minister admits that he will not allocate a brass farthing to the project from his £42 million budget this year.  It is clear from reading the two speeches that neither Minister is willing to make a commitment in future and that it is not just 1992 that they have reneged on in respect of Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referring to the cost of the project said that these figures must be seen in the context of an annual health capital budget of £42 million and that to push ahead with Tallaght we would need to put a stop to virtually every other hospial development in the country for the next four years.  That is not an honest approach to presenting the facts on the Tallaght project.  We know that the cost of the Tallaght project, on the basis of the scaled down version with 450 beds and having spent a good deal on site development already, is in the region of £80 million to £85 million to be spent over the six year period the Minister and the Minister of State repeatedly told us <Col N="263" /> about.  That works out at £14 million per year out of the capital budget.  Last year Ardkeen Hospital in Waterford, catering for a much smaller catchment area, got more then £14 million from the Minister's capital budget.</P>
    <P>This is not just a question of funding; it is a question of political will.  There is a Minister in the Government today who gave up the Whip in order to preserve the third hospital in the city of Limerick. We have two Ministers in this Government and we have not been able to see a start for this hospital 12 years on.  I would ask the House to recall that since 1986 when the sod was turned on the hospital site, £350 million has been spent by this Government on hospital projects and none of it was for the Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of last year the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> made specific commitments in the health area to be financed over seven years.  These commitments amounted in total to a commitment of £450 million to be spent on health, but there was no money to start the Tallaght project. Tallaght was not even mentioned in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> When one looks at the health priorities that face us as a community it is unbelieveable that for Tallaght, an area inhabited by 260,000 people for whom there is no hospital despite recommendations in many reports dating back to 1968, the Government could not bring <Col N="264" /> themselves in their programme for the next seven years to include a reference to their commitment to the Tallaght project and to set aside some money to get it off the ground.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look again at his attitude to this and not be taken in by the responses we have had from so many of his predecessors year in year out on this issue?  The Minister has come to the Department of Health with a reputation for concern and is known to be a Minister who has represented some of the most deprived communities in our city, to be a man who has provided good care for people in his own area as a doctor and as a Deputy.  Will the Minister look again at the priority he and the Government are willing to give the community in South-West Dublin many of whom rank among the most deprived sections of our community? They are afflicted with high unemployment, low incomes and poor health.  The figures are there for the Minister if he wishes to study them.  There are clear links between deprivation and poor health.</P>
    <P>It should be a Government priority to provide funds for Tallaght Hospital.  I hope the Minister will think again in regard to the attitude he has shown in the course of this debate and that Tallaght will come back to the top of his list and will figure in the ten-point plan which we are so eagerly awaiting.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Before moving to my prepared speech on Second Stage of this Bill I should like to take this opportunity to refer to some rather heated debate in the House this morning on the urgency of the Bill in question.  I accept that Deputy Bruton was acting in good faith when he put forward the view that the proposed increases in authorised share capital and borrowing limits under sections 7 and 8 respectively were not of sufficient urgency to warrant speedy enactment of the Bill.  I agree with him.  However, the financial limit that does warrant urgency in this matter is the one which governs the ability of the ACC to lend outside the agriculture sector.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1988 prescribed that the corporation could lend up to 25 per cent of its agricultural loan book to non-agricultural sectors, that is, for every £4 loaned to agriculture, £1 could be loaned elsewhere. The ACC have now reached this ratio of lending and are prevented from further lending to the non-agricultural sectors unless they were to artifically increase their agricultural lending in order to be able to loan 25 per cent of that increase to non-agricultural business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is this limit, the 25 per cent limit, which has been reached and which demands urgent action by way of legislative amendment.  This is provided for, <i>inter alia,</i> by the provisions of section 5 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Without the removal of the existing restrictions on non-agricultural lending, the ACC will remain at a standstill in their efforts to develop and diversify. Effectively they are blocked from taking up good lending opportunities even now. The option of artificially boosting agricultural lending, to which I have referred already, is not a serious one.  Hence the need for urgent action.  I hope I have explained the urgency satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Essentially, the purpose of the Bill is to assist in the further growth <Col N="272" /> and development of the corporation and their activities; to facilitate the Agricultural Credit Corporation's development as a bank by bringing them within the normal banking supervision of the Central Bank; and to ensure that the corporation will be in a position to meet EC regulatory requirements in the banking area.</P>
      <P>The various provisions and amendments contained in the Bill are summarised in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill for the convenience of Deputies.  Before moving on to discuss the contents of the Bill in some detail, I should like to say a few words by way of background about the ACC.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the ACC were established to cater for the special needs of agriculture in this country, in particular by way of the provision of long term credit not easily available from other sources.  The process of growth of the ACC was a slow one, however.  It was not until the sixties that the corporation began to establish themselves as a major lending agency, assisted by legislation which increased their borrowing powers and enabled them to accept deposits from the public.  In this period and in the following decade, growth in agriculture was generally strong, boosted by Ireland's entry into the European Community. The subsequent economic difficulties of the early eighties impacted adversely on the agricultural sector, however and, as a consequence, on the performance of the ACC.  Defaults on loans outstanding and increases in arrears seriously affected the profitability of the corporation, culminating in heavy losses in 1987.  The Agricultural Credit Act, 1988, sought to help address the problems of the ACC, in particular through the granting of powers to the corporation to lend to non-agricultural sectors amounts up to 25 per cent of loans outstanding in the agricultural area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1988, the ACC have turned the corner in relation to their financial position and are now heading for their fourth successive year of increasing profitability. The application of strict lending criteria <Col N="273" /> to new loans, the vigorous pursuit of arrears of payments and the contribution from new areas of lending to the income of the corporation have helped make this new, healthier position possible.  It is not now considered good banking practice to confine oneself to sectoral banking or, indeed, to over-expose a loan book to a single sector.  The Bill is intended to ensure that the improvement in the corporation's situation continues by making provisions to assist in the further development of the ACC, in particular through diversification.  In line with Government policy on the sale of State assets, the disposal of the State's interest in the corporation will fall to be considered in due course when the time is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill itself.  Sections 1 and 3 are, of course, standard provisions relating to necessary definitions to be included in the legislation. Section 2 provides for a change of name of the ACC.  The new name will be &ldquo;ACC Bank&rdquo;.  Although there is no change in substance involved in this new name, it does signal a change in the direction which the corporation are taking.  As part of their development and diversification plans, the ACC are seeking to attract new customers from the non-farm community.  In particular, the major urban centres of population present a potential new market for the corporation's products, such as competitive home loans, cheque book and cheque card accounts, credit cards and personal loans, which were introduced in the recent past.  However, market research has indicated that many urban dwellers have little or no awarnesss of ACC and their activities: in so far as knowledge of the corporation or their role is concerned, they are perceived as an organisation which relates to farming only and not of relevance to the majority of people.</P>
    <P>The change of name, accompanied by appropriate marketing efforts, is intended to help change this &ldquo;rural only&rdquo; image of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The word &ldquo;bank&rdquo; in the new title will put across the message to people <Col N="274" /> that the ACC can offer a full range of banking services relevant both to farming and agri-business on the one hand, and personal and business customers on the other.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the application of certain supervisory provisions contained in Central Bank legislation to the corporation at a date, or dates, to be determined by Ministerial order and after consultation with the Central Bank. These provisions of course will be administered by the Central Bank in respect of the corporation while I, as Minister for Finance, will continue to exercise my existing functions with regard to the ACC.  The proposed Central Bank supervision is in line with Government policy in this area, namely, that given the small scale of resources available for financial supervision of deposit-taking institutions in Ireland and given EC requirements for the regulation of financial markets, it is appropriate that a body such as the ACC should come within the appropriate prudential supervision of the Central Bank. This has occurred already in the case of the Trustee Savings Banks and building societies, and is part of the consolidation process required by the imminent completion of the internal market in financial markets with its attendant increase in competition.  The board of ACC are fully supportive of this new relationship with the Central Bank and see it as an essential step on the way to becoming a competitive banking institution subject to the same rules and regulations as the other credit institutions supervised by the Central Bank.  Indeed, the corporation for some time now, have been submitting financial reports to the Central Bank on a voluntary basis, similar to those which the bank requires of other credit institutions.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is concerned with making explicit the powers of the corporation to engage in normal, modern banking and financial transactions and to provide associated services of his nature, subject to conditions which may be imposed by the authorities.  To this end, section 8 (1) of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978, is being amended and a related provision, <Col N="275" /> namely, section 2 of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1988, is being repealed by section 13 (b) of this Bill.  Apart from some few changes in the description of the activities which may be engaged in, the activities of the corporation covered by section 5 are the same as those enumerated in the 1978 and 1988 legislation referred to.  There are two additional amendments, however, to section 8 (1) of the 1978 Act.  Firstly, section 5 now provides for consultation with the Central Bank in respect of any conditions which the Minister for Finance may impose in relation to the lending and other activities of the corporation.  This consultative process however, will be reversed when the Ministerial order or orders to be made under section 4 of this Bill come into effect; that is, when the Central Bank take prudential supervisory control of the ACC as provided for by section 4.  The Central Bank will then assume the power to impose conditions on the corporation's activities, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, which is provided for in section 5.</P>
    <P>The second main difference between this section and the corresponding provisions of the Agricultural Credit Acts, 1978 and 1988, is that the existing formal restriction on lending outside the agricultural sector is removed.  The 1978 legislation prohibited any such lending while the 1988 Act limited such lending to 25 per cent of the corporation's lending to the agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>This removal of the restriction on lending outside agriculture is a logical one in the development of ACC.  The corporation's share of the farm lending sector has been on a downward trend in the last ten years, but overall they remain a single-sector bank with far greater exposure to this one area than their competitors. As the corporation are set to come under the supervision of the Central Bank in the near future &mdash; under section 4 of this Bill &mdash; it is necessary that the ACC should be in a position to move towards the standards which the Central Bank will wish to lay down in relation to their exposure to risk.  These bank <Col N="276" /> standards, for example, limit the amount which credit institutions may lend to any one borrower or associated group of borrowers or to any particular sector. However, I want to emphasise that the removal of the existing limit on non-agricultural lending by ACC will not precipitate an untoward rush into diversified lending outside agriculture.  I intend, and the Central Bank are of like mind, that the development of ACC's lending in other directions will be a controlled one which is why section 5 includes the provision I have already mentioned that the lending activities of the corporation may be made subject to conditions imposed by the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Central Bank, and <i>vice versa,</i> when regulations under section 4 are made.</P>
    <P>Of course there are other reasons why the removal of the present lending strictures on ACC are necessary apart from the prudential one already mentioned. The ability of ACC to provide credit for the agricultural sector is not enhanced by limiting their opportunities to lend and gain profit in other sectors.  ACC's competitors, who have by far the lion's share of the farm loan market, have no similar restrictions on their lending outside agriculture. ACC's return to profit since 1988 has been aided by their, albeit limited, powers to lend to the non-agricultural sectors and it is envisaged that extension of their ability to lend in these areas will contribute increasingly to their profitability in the future.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the disposal of the State's interest in the corporation in the future, if this course of action becomes appropriate, it would be foolish not to recognise that an organisation which continued to be hamstrung by restrictive lending conditions would be less likely to realise their full potential and thereby maximise the return to the State in terms of the price to be obtained for them.</P>
    <P>However, the further diversification of ACC's lending should not be seen as a diminution of the corporation's commitment to the agriculture sector.  The farming and agri-business sector is recognised <Col N="277" /> as one which will continue to be the single most important strand of the corporation's activities for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an increase in the maximum number of directors of the corporation from seven to nine.  This will allow additional expertise to be brought onto the board at a time when the ACC are at a critical stage of their development and diversification and, incidentally, will bring the corporation into line with the other State bank, ICC, who have nine board members.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for an increase in the authorised share capital of the company from £35 million to £50 million.  This is an enabling provision only as it relates to authorised rather than actual share capital.  The total share capital subscribed for to date is £25.4 million.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for an increase in the existing limit on borrowings by the corporation from £800 million to £1,000 million.  It also provides that the Minister for Finance may attach conditions or limitations to such borrowings, after consultation with the Central Bank.  Again, this is an enabling provision only as borrowings by the corporation, at around £628 million at present, are comfortably below the existing limit of £800 million.</P>
    <P>Section 9 requires that the ACC alter their memorandum and articles of association in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  This is a standard provision.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 are of a technical nature.  They extend the scope of the Banker's Books Evidence Act, 1879, as amended, and section 2 of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, as amended, to the corporation.  These Acts already apply to banks and building societies.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides explicit powers for the ACC to engage in guarantee-type business by the amendment of section 27 of the Insurance Act, 1989, so as to include the corporation among the institutions who are named in that section as being empowered to carry on guarantee business.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (a) recognises that as the ACC are now engaging in the provisions of mortgages in competition with other <Col N="278" /> financial institutions, exemption from payment of Land Registry and Registry of Deeds fees is no longer justified.  The reason for the exemption in the first place had been recognition of the restricted nature of the activities that ACC could engage in, that is, restricted to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (b) provides for repeal of section 2 of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1988.  I have already dealt with this when talking about section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 14, is a standard section.  I hope I have explained clearly the provisions of this Bill but, of course, I shall be happy to elaborate on them if required by any Deputy.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I should like to compliment the board, management and staff of the ACC for their work in turning the corporation around in terms of their financial performance.  I am confident that this Bill will enable the corporation to make further strong advances towards becoming a modern, diversified credit institution who are capable of serving all sectors of the community equally well while retaining their long-established, important relationship with the agricultural sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the frustration felt by my colleagues and, in particular, my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, at the decision to rush through this Bill in a short time.  It was annoying to hear the Taoiseach state then that this was purely a technical Bill.  As we can deduce from the Minister's speech, it is more than a technical Bill.  Having analysed it, it is hard to understand why it is being rushed through the House.  The Minister said it was necessary to move with this Bill urgently.  However, I remain unconvinced of this because so far as I can see the main purpose of it is to increase the share capital of the corporation from £35 million to £50 million. This is an enabling provision as the capital subscribed by the Minister for Finance at present is £25.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC were established in 1927. Over the years they have been closely linked with the development of farming. <Col N="279" /> In keeping with modern trends they will be known in future as the ACC Bank plc. According to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the core business objective of the ACC will continue to provide the agriculture and food sector with credit facilities.  The Government have given a commitment that the ACC will adopt a central role in the provision of necessary credit facilities.</P>
    <P>In the present climate in agriculture it is unlikely that farmers will want to extend their borrowings.  However, increasing, financial pressures on farmers, particularly on those with low incomes, will force them in the direction of seeking extra credit.  The necessity to conform with environmental and pollution control measures will place an added strain on farm incomes which are already in decline.  One-third of Irish farmers have taken out loans.  However, due to the decline in farming many of them are not able to pay off their outstanding loans.  It behoves the ACC to be constantly sensitive to the plight of farmers, especially farmers who are in financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>Farmers with dry stock receive a higher proportion of their income from short term sources.  In the cattle system 40 per cent of the money borrowed is for the purchase of livestock.  While farmers with farms under 20 hectares account for 56 per cent of the farm population they only account for 12 per cent of the total farm debt.  This is an indication of just how viable these small holdings are and is the reason a large number of farmers are not in debt.</P>
    <P>Together with other sectors small and low income farmers are under siege at present.  The long term survival of this segment of the farming sector is at stake. I am referring in particular to farmers who have less than 20 hectares.  As we know, the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT negotiations, which overshadow all other issues in agriculture, will have a further destabilising effect on this sector.  The cost of implementing the new dairy hygiene regulations will also have a destabilising effect on this sector.  We <Col N="280" /> can appreciate why farmers are under serious pressure.</P>
    <P>Milk is to Ireland what oil is to Texas and the small quotas given to many farmers have placed them in an intolerable position.  Proof of this is contained in the recent statement by the Minister for Agriculture and Food that the 16,500 small scale milk producers who have a quota of less than 12,800 gallons will receive an additional allocation of up to 500 gallons.  While this is desirable, it indicates the seriousness of trying to remain financially viable.</P>
    <P>The area of headage grants has caused a lot of concern and many farmers who made small mistakes were deprived of payment.  There has been a little relaxation in the Department's approach and I compliment the farming organisations on their increased vigilance in this area in along with the politicians, pressuring the Minister for Agriculture and Food to make some positive moves in this area. However, many farmers are still being penalised.  At times one would need to be a graduate to understand all the regulations applying to these schemes.  It is not recognised that many farmers left school at an early stage.  I am advised that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is examining this whole area at present to simplify it.  As a result I trust that the Minister will be far more sensitive and appreciate the financial hardship which a refusal of these headage grants causes.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also look at the staffing level in the Department of Agriculture and Food offices.  Over a period of time many politicians in this House have been critical of the slowness and inefficiency of these offices.  I would not like to cast aspersions on the staff of these offices because I am aware that in the Limerick office in my area they work extremely hard and diligently.  However, when one talks to these officials it is obvious that their workload has increased considerably over the last few years as a result of more farmers being eligible for headage grants.  Their workload has also increased because of the extension of the disadvantaged areas and the reclassification which has been going on for the <Col N="281" /> last few months and which is due to conclude shortly.</P>
    <P>This whole area has been the subject of much controversy in farming circles, although 72 per cent of the country has been included.  One hopes that the extensive survey, the appeals which are now being completed and the task of processing the large amount of data will be done quickly.  I understand that in the autumn the Minister will be making submissions to Brussels.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is no restriction on the areas to be included in the submission to Brussels.  If farmers are eligible they should be included and there should not be a stipulation of 1.5 per cent or 1 per cent on eligible farmers because there has been a deep distrust of this scheme in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals outlined in the budget delivered another Scud missile against farmers by removing the tax exemption on the co-operatives and expecting them to pay 40 per cent.  Is the Minister aware that powerful countries such as France, Germany and Italy are exempt?  The co-operatives employ about 16,000 people in Ireland, the vast majority of whom are in rural areas and provincial towns where there are few other jobs.  In addition, the co-operatives and the jobs involved create service employment and in the region of £50 million is provided to the Exchequer in PAYE.  Those co-operatives have a membership of up to 120,000, many of whom are living on an income of less than £7,000 per annum and they are dependent on farmers' dole.  The Minister should seriously reconsider his proposal in relation to taxation of co-operatives.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss, of me not to mention a significant event which indicates the Government's attitude to rural Ireland.  I will illustrate it by means of a small example.  In my constituency, in Carrigkerry, a place I am sure the Minister never heard of, there was a rural post office.  We have all heard references to the Leader, the INTERREG programmes and others, but those references are hypocritical in the extreme. This was an example of a post office in <Col N="282" /> an isolated area in hilly terrain on which 88 old age pensioners depended, but, according to An Post, it was no longer viable because it would have cost an extra £6,000 per year to run.</P>

There is a social aspect to these post offices in rural areas and the Minister should approach the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, to give a subvention in cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one caveat in regard to this legislation.  The ACC have been synonymous with the development of <Col N="283" /> farming.  Can the Minister assure me that it will still be their core business, a statement enshrined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> when it becomes the ACC Bank plc?  I trust the Minister will give this assurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a simple measure; its purpose is to turn the ACC into just another little bank.  The reason is to enable it to be sold to the first available bidder, not to facilitate people waiting for loans, as if in effect they did not have a choice in relation to the rest of the Irish commercial banking sector. Note that I did not say it would be sold to the highest bidder.  When this Bill has been passed the ACC will be disposed of for petty cash.  The Minister has all but admitted that it is being prepared for privatisation and we have seen what happened in relation to that in the past.</P>
      <P>This Bill is nothing more than a coat of polish for the family silver, to borrow a phrase from across the water.  That coat of polish is designed to make it more attractive when it is taken to the pawn shop.  There is no strategic thinking behind this measure, and I will return to this later on.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we should be preparing Ireland for 1992, and for the period after that, when we have the completed internal market in the run up to the implementation of Economic and Monetary Union.  Within a very short period of time, with the advent of Sweden, Austria and Finland to the European Community, there will be a market of 350 million people.  By 1997 we will have an economic and monetary system which will have, <i>inter alia,</i> a single currency. Against that background we should look at what the Government are doing or, more to the point, what they are not doing, in relation to this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of selling our few banking assets should we not now be looking at the future and at the possibility perhaps of linking the existing banking institutions which are indirectly under the control of the Government?  I will name them.  ACC, which is being fattened for <Col N="284" /> sale in the marketplace now that it has turned the corner in regard to profitability. The ICC has effectively been on the marketplace for the last two years, but because of internal constraints &mdash; namely, the Devlin report &mdash; there are no bidders.  The Trustee Savings Bank is ready for sale, now that the legalities have been removed in relation to the nature of its precise ownership; and, to refer to Deputy Finucane's contribution, there is the entire network of the post offices around the country.  Those four institutions, if brought together, could form the nucleus of a diversified and integrated banking system under the control of the State and provide some of the benefits to which the Minister referred in his opening speech.  The idea that ACC could enter the marketplace which is by common consent already over serviced by the banks and gain a significant market share is highly optimistic.  I would like the Minister to indicate the growth ACC anticipate over the next number of years when they redirect their focus from the agricultural sector.  This is a signal to rural Ireland and that section of the community that depended exclusively on ACC for agricultural credit that the Government are getting out of this business in real terms.  I think the Deputies from the Fine Gael Party agree by their presence here.  If the Government want to re-enforce the agricultural sector of ACC there is a much better way of doing that and I suggest that could be achieved by broadening their entire base and by linking them with ICC and the Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>As far as the Labour Party are concerned we, as an island country, with a market of 3.5 million people, which is about to be integrated in an open market of at least 350 million by the end of 1995-97, depending on which way you wish to anticipate it, cannot confine our perspective and analysis to the Irish segment of what will be an integrated European market.  For that reason I would like to see the Irish Government engage in strategic thinking so that they would group into a complementary structure those components of banking, deposit <Col N="285" /> taking or money lending that the Irish Government currently have and which are under their control for various reasons. Not only should those components be integrated in a modern, efficient and rational way but the Government should now be actively looking for partners of like mind and like tradition in the broader European Community.  There are State banking systems right across Europe, some banks have been nationalised in the past for political reasons and other banks were set up in a manner not dissimilar to ACC.  That is where the marriage broking, strategic thinking role of a progressive Minister and his Department of Finance should be focused and not on the sordid little exercise that we are now engaged in.  This has nothing to do with the inability of people to get loans but everything to do with meeting the imperative to dispose of assets.  It is necessary in order to meet the budget targets for the realisation of assets in 1992 and it is necessary in my view to get this little matter out of the way so that a willing buyer can be found and the proceeds of the sale will go to the Minister for Finance in 1992.</P>
    <P>We already saw the indecent haste with which the Department disposed of their shares in Greencore, much to the chagrin and annoyance of the marketplace because there was a general view, which was never adequately replied to by the Minister, that the market had been misled in the way in which the shares were sold but also in the manner in which they were sold.  There is no strategic thinking in this Bill other than the short term one of selling the family silver.  I defy the Minister and his advisers in the Department of Finance to contradict me in relation to that.  If there is to be a future for ACC &mdash; I accept they are locked into a particular position at present and as far back as the early eighties they were saying to people in Fóir Teoranta and other places that they wanted to reduce their dependence on the agricultural sector and broaden their lending base.  If they want to broaden their loan book into different sectors of the economy there <Col N="286" /> are different ways of doing that and in my view this is not the way to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be looking at why ICC are so unattractive in commercial terms.  In banking circles around town ICC are affectionately known as the &ldquo;FAS&rdquo; of banking, that is where bank officials on restrictive wages are trained by the State and then those who are talented are head hunted into the commercial private banking sector or into the wider banking network.  Anybody in the finance industry will tell you that ICC are great for producing people but are not a great institution because they operate under the constraints of the Devlin wage and salary structure.  It is not so long ago that it was revealed that ACC had found creative ways of getting around the constraints imposed by the Devlin Commission.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be opposing this measure.  We believe this is the wrong way to plan for the future of ACC, ICC or Trustee Savings Bank.  We view the Minister's task as creating a new vibrant banking sector that will meet the scale of the challenge that this economy has to face between now and the year 2000.  I suggest that a strategic timeframe should be taken; that the domestic components of the State's financial institutions &mdash; essentially the four elements I have already described &mdash; should be integrated in so far as this can be done effectively and that the Government should look for a partner in the context of the wider European Community &mdash; and not somewhere in New Hampshire or outside the EC market because we have seen the disastrous results that policy has effected in respect of the two major domestic banks here.  I would even go further, there is possibly a better prospect of introducing a dynamic commercial element to Irish banking by linking these institutions with a continental State owned bank.  Anybody who is familiar with the Irish banking system can but wonder at the vibrancy of the way the Woodchester Bank has entered the Irish market and has emerged as a major force. One of the reasons is that they have the backing of Credit Lyonnaise which itself <Col N="287" /> is a State-owned bank.  There is no conflict whatsoever, and there never has been as far as the Labour Party are concerned, between State ownership on one hand and vibrant commerciality and competitive performance on the other.  Some people would argue that the sluggishness and conservatism in the market place of both Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland owes as much to their historic traditions as to the nature of the ownerships of the banks in question.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated the sections which are merely technical, that is, that ACC will pass from the Minister's responsibility, properly in my view, to come under the supervision of the Central Bank and will be treated as just another little bank.  It is quite clear that the bank is ready for sale and will be sold off as soon as possible.  There is no strategy in relation to buyers.  There is clearly no strategy in relation to ICC. Will the Minister indicate if the possibility of ACC merging with ICC has been considered so that they will have the kind of mixed loan book they were seeking. In addition, they might be able to tap in further into the post office network in order to bring about additional synergy in that direction.  These questions have to be put but there is no reference to the possibility that that alternative was considered.  Instead we are faced with what has been proposed by the Minister &mdash; and let me repeat that this refuses to recognise the European dimension.  At the end of the day this will impact on every Irish person whether we see themselves as having a left wing or right wing perspective on the future of our society.</P>
    <P>We are entering into uncharted economic and monetary waters to the extent that the economic levers that will determine economic policy on this island will be controlled from somewhere in the region of Brussels.  The traditional options open to those on the right or left in terms of a nation State economy will be removed as a consequence of the economic and monetary union component of the Maastricht Treaty.  If you accept that analysis it is absolutely essential, as Culliton <Col N="288" /> and many other Irish commentators have proposed, that we have rooted in the country economic institutions, corporate enterprises and other bodies with sufficient clout who have an overall loyalty to this place and the capabilities of our society.  Unless we can create strong financial institutions that are capable of performing in an open competitive market of 350 million people and yet have a rooted sense of loyalty to this particular place, we will jeopardise the future for all of us whether we are of the left or of the right persuasion.</P>
    <P>To prepare the ACC for sale without having any strategic vision as to what kind of role, what kind of allegiance or affiliation with any other particular institution they should have, is an act of irresponsibility. Not only will the interests of that sector of the agricultural community who depend on it be damaged &mdash; and there are Deputies in this House who are better able to comment on that than I &mdash; but it will not, in the long term, reinforce the already frail Irish institutions in the financial sector by virtue of their existing scale and size.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is, in fact, further weakening the potential for a financial consolidation of various institutions by this particular act of pawn broking, at a time when, in the context of the completion of the internal market and the free movement of capital, he should be doing everything possible to consolidate those institutions within a broader market.  Would anybody think an Italian, Spanish or French Minister for Finance would engage in this type of exercise?  This is the residue of discredited Thatcherism whose legitimisation has long since been discarded even by the adherents of Thatcherism across the water.  The residue which is now discredited is being implemented here and if it goes ahead it will have disastrous results.</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill this evening.  In doing so I pay tribute to the management and staff and the board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation who have done some great work over the years in providing risk capital to the agricultural industry and mainly to the farming community.  There are very few farmers who would criticise the ACC for their contribution to Irish agriculture. Were it not for their role in the development of agriculture in providing the kind of moneys I have stated we would not see our agricultural industry developed to the extent it has reached today.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is a difficult business &mdash; a risk business &mdash; and there are very few people who would like to get involved in it.  I would like to see a greater commitment from the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the continuation of their financing of agriculture.  We are told this evening that the purpose of this enabling legislation is to broaden the base and to make it an ACC bank which would compete with the commercial banks.  In doing that I am aware it has a successful network throughout the country who have served the people well.  We are seeing it diversify into the areas of the commercial banks.  I am genuinely worried as to whether we will see the same commitment to agriculture and to the farming community as we have seen in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main trust of the ACC in the deposit area has often come from people in the urban community.  The farming community must have the same trust in depositing money in that organisation.  I wonder why we have not seen cheaper moneys being made available to Irish farmers in terms of Euro loans, because they are at a much lower interest rate than Irish loans.  I am aware of the broad <Col N="290" /> base of loans available from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>Land purchase has been one of the areas that has bedevilled Irish agriculture, and the enormous prices being paid for land have done irreparable damage to the reputation of Irish farmers. There should have been some agreement between the financial institutions in this area where land has made astronomical prices, often with no capacity in earnings to repay, which has put many Irish farmers in grave difficulty and put many packs on the roadside.  We have seen harsh measures being introduced by all Irish financial institutions on the farming community.  I believe that problem arose because of the manner in which the institutions involved themselves in seeking new business.  They were prepared to take risks at all times which was foolish on their part.</P>
    <P>Farmer financial difficulties have been with us for some time and they have been sad on many occasions.  I am aware of one case, a late as today, in my own constituency on which I do not want to dwell.  It was a sad case and I am glad there has been a compromise.  I would ask the question: Why do we not see a greater involvement of the co-operative movement in owning a farmer bank?  We have only to look at the French agricultural industry which is mainly financed from Credit Agricole in France &mdash; a major financial institution.  I think it is the eighth largest financial institution in the world.  I do not understand why Irish farmers and the co-operative movement generally do not make an effort to establish a farmer's bank because we have heard here this evening from the Labour spokesman on Finance, Deputy Quinn, about the threat of privatisation.  I am fully committed to privatisation because capital can be secured only from the market place to further develop the ACC to the level required in the Bill.  The Irish farmers and the co-operative movement generally should interest themselves in the purchase of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and have a farmer bank in this country as we have a farmer-owned <Col N="291" /> insurance company which has been very successful for Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that borrowings by the corporation at around £628 million at present, are comfortably below the existing limit of £800 million.  That is good housekeeping on their part and I compliment them in having the ratio in order.  With the right to borrow to the extent of £1 billion I see the increase as going to another sector of our society and less emphasis, as I have <Col N="292" /> already stated, in agricultural development. Agriculture is a capital-intensive business.  If there is to be any cutback in that area it will be to the disadvantage of our economy and to the disadvantage of Irish farmers and the agricultural industry generally.  I hope we will see the same commitment from the Agricultural Credit Corporation as we have seen in the past.  We are all aware of the fine network of branches throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I was annoyed a few years ago when I say my local branch in Fermoy facing closure.  Much reference has been made to the closure of rural post offices.  I do not like to see ACC branch offices closing especially in an important market town like Fermoy which is known to have the finest agricultural production in the country and the finest cattle sales ring in Munster. Much business was lost which they could have controlled had they remained in the area.</P>
      <P>I wish the Bill well.  If the ACC is privatised I have no difficulty with that because that is the way forward.  I ask the Minister to contact the farming organisations in an effort to get them to take an interest in the ACC so that farmers once and for all would have a say and an input in relation to the financing of agricultural development as money would be available to them in the corporate sector.  I think that is the way forward for our farmers.</P>

      <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister for Finance is showing a lack of confidence in the agricultural industry and is writing off our young farmers.  The ACC were created chiefly for the benefit of our farmers and it is a sad day when the Minister for Finance admits to the House that there is no potential for further expansion in the agricultural industry which would warrant increased borrowing by our farmers.  In relation to their lending powers, the ACC will be <Col N="293" /> dictated to in the future by the Central Bank.  It is apparent that in the future the ACC will only be a figurehead with no lending powers.  The Minister has thrown in the towel and has shown no vision so far as the future of the agricultural industry is concerened.  It is a sad day when the Minister for Finance admits that there is no future for our young farmers when it comes to borrowing from the ACC.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be ashamed of himself for making such an admission in the House, because when the last of the oil and gas is drained out of the Celtic Sea and the seas around our coasts, agriculture will still be our predominant industry.  We have not been blessed with any industry of any consequence apart from agriculture, but down through the years it has been bedevilled by quotas since our entry into the European Community.  The trumpets blared when we joined the European Community.  It was said that there would be no end to the rainbow so far as farming was concerned, but it is evident that the end of the rainbow is now visible.</P>
      <P>It is also sad that a country which depends to a great degree on agriculture is now enlarging the borrowing and lending powers of the only lending agency with a responsibility for the development of agriculture.  The Minister should think again.  He stated that the farm sector's share of the corporation's lending business has shown a downward trend during the past ten years, but what attempts have the Government made to redress this trend?  Have they made any attempt to restore the confidence of the agricultural industry.  Given this lack of confidence, the directors of the ACC have asked the Government to grant them special powers to enlarge their business, but as a result they will be dictated to by the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be seen from the Bill before us tonight that the Government have failed in their efforts to preserve our only industry. It is also evident that the Agricultural <Col N="294" /> Credit Corporation in the future will be dictated to by the Central Bank who will decide their destiny.  This is a sad day for agriculture and our young farmers, who will now be exposed to the whims of the Central Bank.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food have shown a lack of confidence in the agricultural industry.  Indeed, I am amazed that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not present in the House tonight for this important debate for our young farmers.</P>

      <P>As an urban Deputy, I welcome the Bill.  Given the way banking has developed in the nineties, if the ACC are to survive they will have to diversify and find a place in the marketplace.  They cannot fight a battle among the banking giants with one hand tied behind their backs, but that is exactly what is happening. Those banks who have attempted to survive by depending and relying solely on the farming sector have got into serious trouble.  If the ACC are to expand they must move in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the number of staff in the ACC increased by 4 per cent at a time when unemployment was and still is a major scourge.  This in itself was an admirable feat.  The ACC have flexed their muscles and are now preparing to take their place in the banking system in Ireland.  Perhaps they will move on from there to other spheres of activity under the excellent stewardship of Mr. John McCloskey and the chairmanship of Mr. Dan McGing.  They have an excellent team at work.  The ACC have modernised and are in tune with the requirements of farming.  It would be unrealistic for any rural Deputy to suggest that the <Col N="295" /> ACC will abandon their rural base, their core value base.  That is the one way they can develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that they are working throughout the country speaks for itself.  Furthermore, they are also prepared to make changes, unlike many of our major banks today who are far more rigid.  There is a lack of competition and the major banks are charging their customers outlandish fees.  Indeed, they are operating almost &mdash; I do not like to use the word &ldquo;cartel&rdquo;&mdash; in a dictatorial way and they leave much to be desired.</P>
      <P>It is undersirable that our banking system is now gaining a bad image because we have to depend on the major banks.  However there is no competition, and competition is the lifeblood of trade. That is stated in the House day in, day out; yet, when the ACC are preparing themselves to move onwards, reservations are being expressed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of clearance, I would like to see the ACC competing within the clearance system.  While I realise that this is a costly operation and that it costs in the order of £2 million to become a member of this rather exclusive club, nonetheless they should have this option.  I would like to see the base of the ACC strengthened and I would welcome the possibility of a merger.  It has been suggested that there are other vehicles poised in such a way that this would strengthen the base of the ACC.  As a result more funds would be made available for the farming commmunity. However, they should not tie themselves solely to the farming community but make their services available in towns and cities.  They should not be associated with the rural community only.  Competition is badly needed given the way the banking system is now operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unreasonable constraints that the major banks are imposing on small businesses, particularly for collateral for security, tying in with mortgages in a very rigid sense, leave a lot to be desired. <Col N="296" /> Competition is badly needed in this sphere.  As modern technology finds its way into financial services and banking institutions perhaps the real question to concern us is the possibility of people becoming unemployed as a result of future mergers and privitisation.  The way to safeguard against that is to prepare ourselves now for that possibility.  We should install the best possible technology and personnel in the ACC bank and give them the opportunity they are seeking, not as a hand out but because they have deserved the success they have achieved. Anyone who takes the time to study the success of the ACC bank over the past few years must agree with me, because the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to the future development of ACC, and not only for the rural community. I congratulate them for getting out there, finding customers and operating a cheque system, with one of the banks acting as agent for them.  I congratulate them on having their independence and fighting for their survival.  I warmly welcome the Bill and wish the ACC bank every possible success in the future.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Chair's guidance as to the time and I will try to be more disciplined than my predecessors.</P>
      <P>The core of this Bill is contained in the Minister's speech where he says:</P>
      <P>It is now considered good banking practice to confine oneself to sectoral banking or, indeed, to over-expose a loan book to a single sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume there was a misprint in the script and that the Minister meant &ldquo;not to over-expose a loan book to a single sector&rdquo; and that the Bill is intended to ensure that the improvements in the corporation <Col N="297" /> area continue by making provisions to assist in the future development of the ACC, in particular through diversification. I will refer to this later.  Good banking practice has a particular resonance for those of us who have been watching the Irish banking sector for some years.  The sentence which is crucial in the Minister's speech is:</P>
    <P>In line with Government policy on the sale of State assets, the disposal of the State's interest in the corporation will fall to be considered in due course when the time is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>I would like to reflect for a moment on the implications of this.  I have not time to go into it in detail.  The evidence from Britain, where it has been studied, is that privatisation of an uncritical kind, which the Minister is advocating, has not resulted in greater competition in the British economy.  It has not resulted in less inhibiting bureaucratic interference.  In the British case there have been non-statutory authorities set up in the case of gas, oil and other things which are taking up more time of executives than did the previous statutory controls.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech talks of a complicated mechanism of consultation in the future in which the Minister for Finance of the day would have an opinion and would have the advice of the Central Bank, but it would have hardly any statutory effect.  It is just a time wasting exercise. Finally, there is the question whether privatisation reduces the public service borrowing requirement.  Sadly, in the case of even the most ideologically obdurate of Mrs. Thatcher's advisers, the public service borrowing requirement was not reduced in Britain; rather were the gains from the sale of State assets translated into tax reductions for those at the top of the tax scale.  The Minister in his speech very honestly acknowledged the public ownership of State assets and what their privatisation means.  There are powerful arguments to show that the inherent advantages of privatisation have not been achieved.  We have witnessed the last rattle of this kind of economic <Col N="298" /> thinking with the death of the founding high priest of this, Von Hayek, just a couple of days ago and in ten years we will find that most people will be neo-Keynesians again in Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn spoke of the alternative merger of ICC and ACC.  This is an important point which links to my reference to good banking practice in the Minister's speech.  If the Irish people have been let down by the Irish banking system in recent years it has been because of the banking system favouring a culture of speculation rather than a culture of production.  Anyone involved in producing anything significant found it difficult to get credit in terms of demand for collateral and in terms of making stage repayments.  On the other hand those within the banking sector who were also having a shady existence in the interstices of speculation were the people who found a ready availability of capital.  After all of this minor amending bank Act, which points the ACC in the direction of the private sector of banking, will he have any control over credit policy in this country?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to watch an interesting paradox in this exercise.  Privatising is moving in the direction of excluding the State from forms of control, yet when he was Minister for Labour he was moving in a corporate tendency towards inviting the trade unions to come and sit at the table with him.  If the Minister continues this tendency, he may in future be inviting the trade unions and the other social partners to sit at the table with a Minister for Finance and a Minister for Labour who have no control over anything.  The Minister will have handed the banking sector to speculators who have no commitment to anything in this country or abroad except speculative profit.</P>

      <P>The Minister was correct in that the ACC have always been seen as a basically rural organisation.  The change of name from ACC to ACC Bank has not been the cause of much public discussion to date.  The only matter of public discussion in relation to ACC is the question of when it will be privatised. I congratulate Deputy O'Keeffe for coming clean on that issue and for stating his support for the future privatisation of ACC.  The Minister's speech gave a few hints as to how the corporation will be disposed of by saying that the disposal of the State's interest in the corporation will fall to be considered in due course.  The Minister also said that if this course of action becomes appropriate it will be sold.  We should have been informed tonight by the Minister of his intentions in that regard.  It is the most pertinent thing in relation to the ACC.  I have no ideological objections to the privatisation of ACC, but we should have been informed.  The time has come to stop beating around the bush.</P>
      <P>The ACC were considered, and probably still are, as being the friend of the farmer.  That was the concept during the sixties and the seventies, which was a boom time in the agricultural industry. In the late seventies and early eighties certain factors changed, a credit squeeze was imposed and there was a crisis in agriculture.  Many people who had put their faith in the ACC and borrowed money from them received threatening letters, legal edicts and knocks on the door from the sheriff seeking money. Their faith in ACC may have been diminished somewhat.  When it comes to money matters the ACC are similar to every other financial institution and the market must dominate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the people who ended up in severe financial distress were in that position because of inflated land prices.  It was sadly ironic that land worth £1,000 per acre was making £3,000 or £4,000 <Col N="300" /> per acre.  Neighbour was bidding against neighbour and in many instances the same financial institution were providing ammunition to both parties.  That type of credit policy resulted in a degree of human misery in the late seventies and in the early and mid-eighties.  Let us not have a repeat.</P>
    <P>We are to discuss during the next few days the termination of the Land Commission, which used to provide some control over land sales.  It would be detrimental if we were again to see neighbour versus neighbour and inflated land prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned the lack of strategic thinking in this legislation and he may well be correct.  The Culliton report puts forward a number of suggestions about the utilisation of the food industry to create the jobs needed in the nineties.  Surely an institution such as the ACC should play a leading role in the developmental side of agri-industry, but nothing we have heard from the Minister tonight or from the ACC indicates that they see as part of their future a developmental role in agriculture and the food industry.  Action is required on that front. We need a concerted, planned economic policy for the future of agriculture and the food industry.  The financing of that industry must be a central part of the planning.  I hope the ACC will play a leading role.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the ACC will be enabled to become involved in related borrowing.  This will help to strengthen their position.  They should not forget the farmers of rural Ireland who, I hope, will be in a position to borrow money to develop their farms during this decade. Many speakers have said that agriculture is in crisis and suggested that we may never again see the expansion which we witnessed in the seventies.  I hope they are incorrect.  We need to see a growing agricultural industry in the years to come.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in Government with that dreaded &ldquo;P&rdquo; word, privatisation. Certain Government sections and external factions advocate privatisation, but the Minister for Finance has not come clean on this issue in <Col N="301" /> relation to the ACC.  He should outline very clearly when he sees the ACC being privatised.  His speech indicates that they are due to be considered for privatisation. We should all like to know when that day will come.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bradford made a point about the impact of legal edicts and the fact that the ACC pursued farmers relentlessly for non-recoverable loans.  That regrettably is true but it derives from the fact that the associated banks fuelled the level of borrowing in the seventies and led to the tailspin effect to which Deputy Bradford referred.  My memory of the accounts of the ACC is that about £60 million was written off in the years immediately preceeding 1990 in non-recoverable loans. That was because of this spiral&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of inflated land prices and so on.  The Minister is preparing the ground for this to happen again uncontrollably when he prepares this bank for privatisation.  The Bill is misconceived.  It would be more honest of the Minister to bring the sentence to which Deputy Higgins drew attention to the top of his speech and to say that this is the purpose for which he is introducing the Bill.  He should say it is necessary to make these technical changes to facilitate the transfer of this bank to the private sector.</P>
      <P>This Bill highlights the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of planning for industrial and agricultural development.  The Culliton report contains a key section on the development of the food industry.  Very little attention was paid in that report to the financial institutions, but it is clear that if we are to exert any strategic control over the direction of the developmental role envisaged originally for the ACC it is important that the State maintain the power to have some strategic influence. That is what the Minister is giving away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins and Deputy Quinn referred to the Thatcher experiment. Television coverage of the British election <Col N="302" /> campaign shows that after extensive privatisation the Exchequer borrowing requirement has gone up and taxes for the top bracket have come down.  Privatisation has not solved any of the structural problems in the British economy and certainly has not facilitated investment in industry.  The critical issue is investment in industry.</P>
    <P>My party produced a recent policy document which argued for a look at the area of the financial institutions.  Piecemeal measures have been taken in the abolition of Fóir Teoranta, the extension of the 10 per cent tax regime and a number of other <i>ad hoc</i> measures which are not integrated in any plan for industry. We argue for an examination of the role of the IDA lending division, the ICC, An Post and the ACC.  The elements are there which could give the Minister, the Government and the State some strategic control over the direction of development in a key industry, which is what agriculture is.</P>
    <P>Industrial development is still the key to job expansion.  Of course services are taking up a more and more important proportion of job creation and to some extent wealth creation, but industrial development is still the key to job expansion. If we are to achieve any major boost in job expansion, we will have to look to this area, including agriculture and the food industry.</P>
    <P>There has been a public outcry in recent weeks about the significance of the UMP collapse.  Local Deputies in the areas affected by that tragic economic and industrial blow, particularly the towns in the west, will argue whatever it is expedient to argue in the circumstances, and most politicians understand that.  At the end of the day there probably is an argument for a body such as Fóir Teoranta, not a body abused and used as a milch cow, as were Fóir Teoranta in the past, but a financial institution that can intervene to keep alive, or bring back to health, an industry that is basically sound.</P>
    <P>I regret that as the tide of Thatcherism ebbs in Britain, we are caught up in the wash.  On a serious political point, the <Col N="303" /> Bill is a manifestation of the struggle that continues for the soul of Fianna Fáil. Only a few years ago, the Minister for Finance in particular would have denounced this kind of <i>ad hoc</i> privatisation. It was the dynamic that drove the Progressive Democrats who clearly have won the day for the policy struggle within Fianna Fáil and we will all live to regret that.  As Mrs. Thatcher flew to the United States last night, leaving her successor sinking deeper and deeper into the mire that she created for him, capital will have to be found to renew British industry.  I do not think that this measure offers any hope for using agriculture as a basis for job creation in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available to me I will try as best I can to answer the questions raised.  Only 15 per cent of farm lending comes from ACC while 85 per cent comes from the associated banks. Obviously that is not known to the vast majority of Deputies who spoke because they seemed to think that ACC are responsible for 95 per cent of farm lending. It is important to restate that the bank have already reached the 25 per cent ceiling on their non-agricultural lending.  Since I came to the Department of Finance, both the board and the executive have been asking me to remove the ceiling immediately in order to allow the bank to continue developing.</P>
      <P>I find it hard to take seriously people who on the one hand talk about development of State companies while at the same time miss the point of the legislation. It is the usual double think arrangement.  Deputies want to stifle the company and put them out of existence but they will probably support privatisation when there is nothing left to sell.  We are not abandoning the agricultural sector.  Deputy Finucane asked a question on this matter and I am glad to tell him that what is involved is the inevitable and necessary process of diversification, of spreading the risk in order to ensure a continued increase in profitability and financial stability of ACC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> I would refer Deputy Michael Higgins to the section dealing with single sector banking, which is not now considered good banking practice.  In the modern financial world single sector banking, or putting all one's eggs in the same basket, is an activity fraught with danger.  It may jeopardise the very sector that one is trying to cosset if it results in lost opportunities to improve financial performance. That is taken into account by State banking.  I could talk at length to Deputy Quinn about Credit Lyonnaise and their experience in that regard, but I do not have the time to do so now.  I agree with the Deputy that people must be careful.  I have great admiration for Credit Lyonnaise and Woodchester and they would agree with what we are doing here for the sector.</P>
    <P>The role of ACC in the agriculture sector must be put in perspective.  As I have said, ACC have only 15 per cent of the lending market.  The bulk of agricultural lending is operated by the banks and no restriction is imposed on their lending to sectors outside of the agricultural sector.  For that reason ACC do not have the same opportunity as have the other banks.  There is a more fundamental reason for the removal of the existing restriction on lending by the ACC to sectors outside of the agriculture sector.  The Central Bank have indicated that a move in this direction is necessary if the ACC are to be in a position to comply with the normal standards and financial prudence laid down by the Central Bank in respect of banking. However, that does not mean that all powers will be lost.  The existing powers and function of the Minister for Finance in relation to the corporation will not be affected by section 4 of this Bill.  The Minister will continue to hold all the share capital of ACC and will appoint the directors.  He will continue to monitor their general financial performance.  An officer of the Department will act on the board and will, of course, remain responsible for amending legislation in the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I find some of the alternative ways quite interesting.  However, in answer to Deputy Bradford, having been in the Department of Finance for a matter of months I am not prepared to jump in a certain direction because somebody says that is the way to jump.  The future of ACC is not predetermined, as has been suggested.  My Department are aware of some of the possibilities to which Deputy Quinn in particular has referred.  I assure the Deputy that all the options are open to the State and will be examined in due course.  Some of the synergies referred to by the Deputy are quite interesting, but there is no question of a quick disposal for a quick buck. There is logic in some of the points made by the Deputy, but whether or not agreement could be reached with ICC and Trustee Savings Bank on these issues is another matter.  I accept that these bodies are entities in their own right and that they are major employers who make relatively small profits.  Unfortunately, one <Col N="306" /> of the dangers of privatisation, whether within the State or outside it, is rationalisation. The difficulty I have with privatisation &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte will have heard me say this on many occasions, both in Opposition and otherwise &mdash; is that it inevitably leads to rationalisation.</P>
      <P>In the case of Trustee Savings Bank, I pushed for amalgamation and signed the order two weeks ago allowing for that. There are about 800 people employed in that instance.  In the case of ICC and ACC there are also many people involved, although these corporations may not make a great annual profit.  I will consider Deputy Quinn's suggestion, but if these companies were to amalgamate on the basis of a joint venture with another State company it would lead to rationalisation.  What concerns me is that at a time when we are trying to protect employment, even where profits are small, rationalisation can lead not only to diversification of activities but to a loss of employment.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's point but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The announcement by Bord na Móna that they intend closing their plant at Lullymore, County Kildare on 5 June next came as a great shock to one of the most efficient workforces here. They have shown whenever it was put to them, they were prepared to meet any targets, comply with any efficiency guidelines, in order to produce and sell efficiently within their catchment area. The workforce have met all the criteria laid down by the board over the years. They are deeply disappointed that there is a proposal to close their plant which is located in an area which has suffered tremendously from the effects of unemployment and job losses in recent years. The area suffered from the loss of jobs in the former shoe factory in Edenderry and in the mushroom industry in the locality.  Such effects have been felt all the more severely by virtue of the fact that the workforce at Lullymore are the most dedicated nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this issue this evening to request the Minister to exercise a number of options open to him.  For example, he can evaluate Bord na Móna's proposals for redevelopment nationwide, using <Col N="310" /> Lullymore as a pilot project to develop alternative enteprises, so that that workforce can retain their employment.  For example, he can call on Bord na Móna to defer their proposal to close Lullymore until some such possibilities have been examined.  I ask him to do so before it is too late and before the spirit of the people of the area has been broken.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also be aware that he gave an undertaking in relation to Allenwood power station &mdash; which we fully endorsed &mdash; ensuring that it remained in existence until all of the available peat had been utilised.</P>
    <P>I can assure him that he would receive the full support of all Members representing County Kildare, and others and the admiration of local people if he examined all the options open to him.  If not he will be subjected to the contempt of the people of the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has direct, ultimate responsibility for Bord na Móna since he is the owner.  Indeed, responsibility for the closure of the briquette factory, if it goes ahead, will lie solely with the Minister for Energy.  This factory produces quality briquettes from local raw material, selling all of them at a profit.  There is no reason in the wide world this factory should be closed unless it is to be a sacrificial lamb to the God of bookkeeping and right wing ideology.  As owner of the factory I ask the Minister ro reverse that decision.</P>

      <P>The Lullymore announcement of last week was a devastating blow to the people of north west Kildare, an area which has sufferd enormously from unemployment in recent years.  If his decision is not rescinded and the Lullymore factory closes it will have very serious social consequences for the north west Kildare area.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to convince Bord na Móna not to go ahead with this planned closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna have indicated that the <Col N="311" /> sales of solid fuels have dropped dramatically over the past few years. However, they have to answer a number of questions.  Has their marketing strategy been correct?  Have they been aggressive enough in tackling the market?  It is only since the ban on the use of bituminous coal in Dublin two years ago that they have made any roads into the Dublin market.  I call on Bord na Móna to explore the other avenues open to them before they close the factory a Lullymore.  The workers in this factory have given great service to Bord na Móna.  They have adapted to the new work practices introduced in the factory, co-operated with the company in every way and as previous speakers said, met the targets they were given.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that this factory remains open.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the Deputies that my Department and I have been kept fully informed at all times of developments at board level in Bord na Móna.  Prior to the recent decision of the board I had discussions with the chairman and received all the relevant information in relation to the proposed closure of Lullymore briquette factory in County Kildare.  In the circumstances, there was no need to invoke the provisions of section 18 of the Turf Development Act, 1946.  The information submitted to me has already been made available to the press and to public representatives in Kildare by Bord na Móna, with the exception of some commercially sensitive information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated publicly, I very much regret the necessity for this decision to close one of the four factories due to gross over-capacity in the production of briquettes and the continuing drop in the consumption of solid fuels, including briquettes.  I realise the difficult circumstances for the workforce who have given loyal service to Bord na Móna over the years and I know the company will be anxious to do the best they can for them in the circumstances.  I have <Col N="312" /> been informed by the chairman that there will be no compulsory redundancies and the staff will be offered the option of redeployment.</P>
    <P>In view of Bord na Móna's delicate financial position, there seems to be no alternative course of action.  I am informed by the board that this decision will reduce the company's debt by £10 million by the end of the decade.  This decision was taken after a careful analysis of all the factors involved and a detailed comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the four briquette factories at Derrinlough and Croghan, County Offaly, Littleton in County Tipperary and Lullymore in County Kildare.  The reasons Lullymore was chosen were detailed by Bord na Móna in information issued to public representatives, and I quote:</P>
    <P>(i)  Factory production costs at Lullymore are close to 20 per cent greater than the average of the other factories.</P>

      <Col N="313" /> (v)  If a factory is to be closed, the combination of factories which optimises the remaining production capacity in relation to demand is that which excludes the factory at Lullymore.</P>
    <P>Total briquetting capacity in the four factories amounts to almost 560,000 tonnes whereas projected sales in the current year amount to about 400,000 tonnes. In effect, capacity exceeds current and foreseeable demand by a little more than the equivalent of a factory's production. Bord na Móna estimate that sales of briquettes will decline over the next decade so that over-capacity will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>In 1991 Bord na Móna dealt with their over-capacity problem by closing each of the factories in turn for a period of approximately 16 weeks, but this arrangement did not provide sufficient savings and closure of a briquette factory is seen by the board as an essential element in the drive to improve profitability and secure the long term future of the company.</P>
    <P>Any industry faced with a steady long term decline in demand for their products must respond in a commercial manner. Not to do so will only worsen the eventual situation even if the company have a healthy balance sheet to start with.  Bord na Móna, on the other hand, are in a very serious financial situation with total debts of over £180 million and a balance sheet deficit of over £70 million.  This situation can be improved very substantially by the achievement of cost savings and productivity improvements.  The high price paid by the ESB for milled peat bought from Bord na Móna represents an annual burden on electricity consumers of over £30 million.  I firmly believe that milled peat should continue to provide a significant part of Ireland's energy resources but the cost must be reduced as much as possible in the interests of competitive electricity prices for the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have already made it clear that, given the continuing pressures <Col N="314" /> on the Exchequer, the question of providing State equity is not an option.  The board of Bord na Móna, having completed extensive examination of the issue over the past 18 months, came to what their chairman described to me as &ldquo;the inevitable decision to close this factory&rdquo;. I believe this decision is a realistic response by Bord na Móna to severe over-capacity in a declining market.  We cannot delude ourselves that there are any other easier options open to us as regards the future of Bord na Móna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3 April last year I wrote to the then Minister for Health calling for an independent inquiry into what was going on in Beaumont Hospital. That was the culmination of a long series of questions I had put down to the Minister for Health going back as far as November 1989, arising out of my continued concern at the extraordinary events which were taking place in the neurosurgical department of Beaumont Hospital.  During the period of this controversy more than £1.5 million, most of it public money, has been spent on investigations and litigation because of the state of affairs in the hospital.  Patient care has suffered grievously and I have been informed that there are now 700 on the waiting lists for necessary treatment. Despite the dozens of parliamentary questions, Adjournment debates and Private Notice Questions, no Minister for Health has said anything about the matter up to this except to express total confidence in everyone involved.  I sincerely <Col N="315" /> hope that this state of affairs will now be brought to an end.</P>
      <P>A number of reports have already been prepared in regard to the issues involved. These reports are complex and quite alarming. There has been a mountain of correspondence, claims and counter-claims in relation to the operation of the neurosurgical department.  I believe morale in the hospital has been shattered and its reputation has been severely damaged. Even today the hospital is awash with rumours of more suspensions or further pending dismissals.  Some of the reports have been considered by the Medical Council.</P>
      <P>I have been particularly disturbed to discover that one report has never been examined by that body, even though it has a fundamental bearing on certain decisions which have already been made. The report in question was commissioned by the Medical Protection Society and has, I understand, been in the hands of the Medical Council for some weeks at least.  It was prepared by a highly respected consultant neurosurgeon, Dr. Jonathan Punt of the University Hospital in Nottingham.  He was brought in as an independent consultant, with no connection at all with any individual there, to give an objective, professional and modern view on the work practices in the hospital.  It would be unfair of me to set out in detail the findings of that report as it deals with the conduct of individuals in a very trenchant and forthright way.  I am aware that the Minister has had sight of that report.  I expect him to be able to reassure the House tonight that its contents will receive the closest possible scrutiny, will not be suppressed and will be acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister tonight to announce that he intends to announce an inquiry not alone into the suspension of one individual neurosurgeon but into every aspect of the running of the neurosurgical department in that hospital.  I recognise that it may not be possible to hold such an inquiry in public but the Minister must agree on two basic requirements: (1) that it will be chaired by an <Col N="316" /> independent professional from outside the hospital and (2) that their findings will be published.</P>
    <P>I am dismayed at the actions of the board of the hospital over the last few years.  The board must bear a considerable portion of the blame.  I hope that when the Minister considers the future of that board within the next couple of months, there will be a hope and expectation that the centre of excellence which we expected to be established for neurosurgery, the flagship for neurosurgery, will be restored and that confidence in the overwhelming excellence of the medical staff there can also be restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Howlin for giving me part of his time.  I have been relatively quiet on the subject of the concern expressed by the public in the constituency which I represent in Dublin North Central, in relation to the neuro-surgery department of Beaumont Hospital because, initially, I felt it would sort itself out.  However, I now believe that this matter is of grave concern and the cause of huge public disquiet.  The morale in the hospital is possibly at its lowest ebb and confidence must be restored, not just in the hospital, but in the catchment area which it services.  It has a budget of something in the region of £47 million, a huge amount of money to spend on health care services in which the public have no confidence.</P>
      <P>The rumour machine is at its best in relation to what the public and patients have heard.  There is only one way in which this matter can be dealt with, I know the Minister indicated that he will have an inquiry and I support Deputy Howlin's call in relation to not just the suspension of Mr. Ó Laoire but into the whole neurosurgery department.  I honestly believe that something is wrong and there is only one way in which confidence can be restored to the public, that is by having a public inquiry.  I ask the Minister to initiate such an inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="317" /> wish to thank the Deputies for their very restrained approach to this matter.</P>
      <P>Before taking up office I was most concerned about the difficulties which have arisen within the neurosurgical unit at Beaumont Hospital.  As I indicated to the Dáil last week I have taken a particular interest in the matter since becoming Minister for Health last month.  I was anxious, above all, that matters be resolved to allay any fears that the public may have in relation to standards of care at the hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will appreciate, however, that I am somewhat constrained in the degree to which I can comment on certain aspects of the situation given the ongoing inquiry which is being conducted by the Fitness to Practise Committee of the Medical Council into allegations made against staff at the neurosurgical unit.  The Medical Council are the statutory regulatory authority for the medical profession set up by the Oireachtas and in carrying out their functions the Fitness to Practise Committee of the council have the powers, rights and privileges vested in the High Court or a judge thereof.  I hope, however, that the Medical Council would be in a position to conclude their inquiry at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>A situation has arisen now in relation to one of the six consultant neurosurgeons at the unit in that, under the disciplinary procedures of the consultant's contract with his employing authority, he has received notice of his suspension as and from today.  I was only formally notified of this decision on Monday last and, in accordance with the disciplinary procedures, I have been requested to establish a committee of inquiry which must meet not later than three weeks from the date of the suspension. Having considered this request I have now commenced the process of putting this committee of inquiry in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the committee of inquiry, following their deliberations, make certain recommendations an appeal will lie with me as Minister for Health.  In these circumstances, I am sure the House will <Col N="318" /> fully appreciate that, in fairness to the parties involved, it would be most inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to the present level of services at the unit I should state that the complement of consultant neurosurgeons includes two newly appointed neurosurgeons who have taken up duty in recent weeks.  One of these has a special interest in paediatric neurosurgery.  As regards the present waiting list, I am satisfied that the additional staff and significant extra facilities which have been approved will make a major contribution to reducing the numbers on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The two patients who need immediate treatment have been advised &mdash; as have their surgeons &mdash; that they may have their operations in the Mater Private Hospital if they wish to have their operations carried out by the surgeon.</P>

      <P>In June 1990 I took part in an Adjournment debate on the funding crisis faced by the Aoibhneas women's refuge in Ballymun which caters for the northside of Dublin city, which was then threatened with closure due to a shortage of money.  On that occasion money was found to allow the refuge to continue its vital work.  Unfortunately, no permanent solution was found to the funding difficulties, almost two years later history has repeated itself and the refuge which caters for the entire northside of the city is again in serious difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the refuge has funding to allow it to operate for another five weeks and, unless money is found, it will once again face closure, which would be a disastrous <Col N="319" /> outcome for the women and children who depend on its services.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme transmitted early last month depicted in very graphic terms the plight of women suffering from male violence.  The programme suggested that Dublin should have 112 bed spaces to cater for the needs of the women and children who are forced to flee from their own homes as a result of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>The only refuge on the northside of the city has been operating for several years in a single two bedroomed flat and has just recently acquired an adjacent flat with one bedroom.  In other words, instead of the 50 plus bed places estimated to be needed, Aoibhneas have just three bedrooms to cater for the whole northside of Dublin.  The inevitable overcrowding is apalling, the two bedroomed flat normally caters for four families, two families per bedroom.  This means an average of two women and six children. Last year Aoibhneas had to turn away more than 200 families simply because there was no room for them.  The refuge had a bed occupation of more than 3,000, nearly 400 callers per day and over 1,000 telephone calls.  There are six full-time and one part-time staff and it is only as a result of their dedication and commitment that the refuge has remained in operation.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that it will take a sum of £100,000 to run the refuge this year, even with running costs kept to a minimum and wages at rock bottom level. However, it appears that total funding from the Eastern Health Board this year will be less than 50 per cent, leaving a shortfall of more than £50,000.  At the best of times it would be difficult for a small voluntary refuge to raise this money but with the difficulties all voluntary organisations face as a result of the success of the national lottery it leaves them with an impossible task.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Eastern Health Board to adequately fund the refuge makes neither economic nor social sense. The Eastern Health Board have spent £53,000 on bed and breakfast accommodation <Col N="320" /> in Dublin as a result of the lack of refuge space.  This is enough to make up the shortfall in Aoibhneas funding for 1992.  How much more will the Eastern Health Board have to spend on bed and breakfast accommodation if Aoibhneas closes as a result of lack of funding.  I appeal strongly to the Minister not to allow this to happen by ensuring that sufficient funds are provided for the rest of the year and that annual funding is placed on a proper basis to ensure that the refuge can plan properly.  In the longer term adequate funds must be provided to allow them to acquire a site to set up and run a proper purpose-built refuge for the northside of Dublin city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa for giving me the opportunity of joining with him in appealing to the Minister for proper short term and long term funding of the Aoibhneas Women's Refuge in Ballymun.  I too received what amounted to a desperate appeal from the small group of committed volunteers who are operating a vital service in the Ballymun area which serves the rest of Dublin northside.  Indeed, their catchment area stretches into north County Dublin and adjoining areas.  I appeal to the Minister to fund them properly not just on this occasion but in the long term because the demand on their service is evidence of the great need for it.  The number they have to turn away indicates a need for a more substantial facility, preferably in purpose-built accommodation properly suported and funded by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aoibhneas operate under impossible conditions from three bedrooms.  They have to meet the level of demand indicated by Deputy De Rossa.  They do so only because there is a tremendous commitment from the voluntary organisations locally.  This is, however, a totally inadequate response to the problems of violence.  It is a crying shame that so little is on offer.  The organisation have indicated to us very strongly that within five weeks all their resources will be exhausted unless an immediate solution is found.  I appeal for immediate help.  In <Col N="321" /> addition I ask the Minister not to let the matter sit for another 12 months, because we will have to come back and appeal for funding.  The Minister should put some long term arrangement in place for Aoibhneas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputies' concern about the problem of family violence and the need to ensure there is adequate alternative accommodation for the unfortunate women and children who find themselves victims of that violence.</P>
      <P>Accommodation is available in seven refuges and hostels in Dublin for women and children who have to leave their homes as a result of violence.  I understand that the level of demand for emergency accommodation is sometimes beyond the capacity of the specialised units.  Where this happens, the victims of domestic violence are offered accommodation elsewhere on an emergency basis and transferred to one of the refuges as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Funding of the various refuges is primarily a matter for the Eastern Health Board.  The Aoibhneas Womens Refuge in Ballymun was initially largely funded through the social employment scheme operated by the Department of Labour. However, since mid-1990 funding has been provided by the Eastern Health Board.  In 1991 the refuge received £43,500 from the health board and I understand the proposed grant in respect of 1992 is £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Aoibhneas are anxious to expand their services and that discussions have been taking place with Dublin Corporation with a view to acquiring a site.  As Aoibhneas have been granted the status of an approved body under the terms of section 5 of the Housing Act, 1988, they would be eligible to apply for financial assistance towards the cost of building accommodation under the voluntary housing scheme.  I am also aware that Women's Aid have had discussions with Dublin Corporation concerning the provision of second stage housing accommodation for families displaced by domestic violence.  The proposal <Col N="322" /> involves the provision of up to 30 houses for families where continuing support could be given to them.</P>
    <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation that a site on the north side of the city has been reserved for the Women's Aid project.  The group's intention would be to apply under the voluntary housing scheme for financial assistance towards the cost of building the accommodation. Women's Aid have already received a grant of £25,000 from the Department of Social Welfare towards the overall cost of the project.  The provision of the proposed second stage housing and the planned expansion by Aoibhneas Womens Refuge &mdash; if they are successful in acquiring a suitable site &mdash; would facilitate the freeing up of places in the existing facilities.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Eastern Health Board to continue to monitor the situation carefully and keep me fully informed of developments.  I will do whatever I can to have the matter of funding raised by both Deputies tonight re-examined in the light of their contribution to see what can be done to ease the situation in the short term and in order to plan for the long term.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The completion of the internal market by 1 January 1993 will have serious implications for the economy of County Donegal. Of the 91 Customs and Excise staff currently employed throughout the county, 65 will be surplus to requirement &mdash; in other words simply out of a job.  The loss of these workers and their families to County Donegal is estimated to be of the order of £1 million annually.  The cost in social terms is incalculable.  A county already suffering the highest unemployment rate <i>per capita</i> can ill afford to sacrifice a further 65 jobs.  The vast majority of those affected have family responsibilities; homes to maintain, <Col N="323" /> mortgages to pay and children to educate. Their dependants number about 200 and their contribution to the economy of the county is crucial at a time when it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract industry and create employment in one of our most peripheral counties. There is massive uncertainty as to what the future holds for these families. They are being kept in the dark in a most unfair way not knowing what type of employment, if any, will be available from 1 January next.</P>
    <P>The Minister should recognise that after Dundalk, County Donegal will be the next major blackspot as a result of the internal market arrangement.  I suggest to the Minister of State that the next major block of work identified should be transferred to County Donegal.  The problem could be solved by the placing of the administration block for motor vehicle excise duty in the county from January 1993.  I urge the Minister to seriously consider this option.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem for the families involved and the county in general. I urge the Minister to address it immediately and relieve the tensions and anxiety of all those involved.  They should be spared from further uncertainty and told what the future holds for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on current decisions and assumptions, they estimate that about 604 jobs will be lost in Customs and Excise following the completion of the internal market on 1 January 1993.  The impact of the internal market changes falls unevenly on Customs and Excise locations.  Understandably areas with a heavy customs preventive work element will suffer most.  The Revenue Commissioners recognise that the Donegal area is in this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners are endeavouring, with the co-operation of all the Civil Service unions, to find work for all the surplus staff in their present locations.  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, <Col N="324" /> said in his budget speech, it is essential that the surplus Customs and Excise staff are used to the maximum in the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion and avoidance.  Full co-operation and flexibility will be required from the staff unions to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have put forward specific proposals for the absorption of surplus staff within Revenue, through the expansion of some existing functions of the Customs and Excise service, especially the strengthening of the common external frontier, increased control of drugs and other illicit traffic, improved Common Agricultural Policy control and post importation audit work. Included in these proposals is the involvement of Customs and Excise staff in new areas of work which will arise post-1992 and which have the potential to provide substantial employment opportunities. One such area involves the collection of Community Intrastat statistics and the VAT information exchange system.  The Government have already decided to give Revenue responsibility for this new work which will generate over 100 jobs. The commissioners have also made proposals to Government for a major role for Revenue in the administration of a new motor vehicle taxation and the Government's decision on this matter will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>Pending the Government decision on motor vehicle taxation and the completion of the necessary negotiations with the unions concerned, the commissioners have not yet decided where to locate the administrative centres for the new work areas in question.  I can, however, assure both the House and the Deputy that the Donegal area, being one of the areas which has a particularly severe surplus staff problem, will be high on the list of priority locations for new work or any other option which will alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have put a lot of effort into designing a strategy, the ultimate aim of which is to ensure that to the greatest extent possible a career is provided for all Customs and Excise staff <Col N="325" /> in or close to their present locations.  In keeping the human and domestic factors to the forefront we would hope that through co-operative flexibility on all sides this aim can be achieved.</P>

      <P>I should like to place on record that I welcome unreservedly the announcement of the Minister and the Government that they will decentralise the Central Statistics Office to Cork and that Cork will become a beneficiary of the decentralisation programme at long last.  In a response I received from the Minister on 3 March he said tenders had been received by the Commissioners of the Office of Public Works on 28 February for provision of accommodation for the CSO, that those tenders were being examined and that a decision on the site to be used would have to await the outcome of that examination.  The Minister in his reply ruled out the site at Polefield, Blackpool, County Cork, in my constituency and said it was no longer one of the sites being considered.</P>
      <P>Criticism has been levelled at some public representatives in the Cork area when they raised the whole issue of the optimum site.  Different people have different opinions, but local and national democracy allows people to give their views and that right should never be denied them.  Local people have the best opinion of what is best for their city.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify a few points.  Can he clarify once and for all why the Polefield, Blackpool site was deemed unsuitable?  It is in an area of high unemployment.  It would be adjacent to a major road development.  Can he clear up the mystery of why the Polefield site has been ruled out?  Can he give us an idea as to when the considerations of the Office of Public Works will be finalised and when can we expect an announcement on the site?  Even at this stage I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the Polefield site in Blackpool because I believe it is a good site and that it deserves greater consideration than it has been given.</P>

      <P>I have listened with <Col N="326" /> interest to what Deputy Allen has said and I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking to the House about the proposed decentralisation of the Central Statistics Office to Cork city.  There is no uncertainty whatever about this proposal. The motion before me has no reference whatever to the specific request made by Deputy Allen pertaining to the Polefield site.  It asks about the ongoing uncertainty regarding the location of the Central Statistics Office at Cork.  I want to clarify there is no doubt about that. The previous Fianna Fáil Government took a decision in 1960 to proceed with a decenralisation programme.  We picked specific locations in the country.  We went out of office in 1982 and Deputy Allen's party in Government decided to cancel the programme and dispose of the sites we had acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have decided, in the interests of making a contribution to the local economy in Cork and creating equality of opportunity for public services in that area, that Cork should be a beneficiary of the decentralisation programme.  To do that we had to have consultation with the local authority during which it was made clear to us that the wish of the local authority in Cork, due to the representations made to them about other proposals for the Polefield site, was that the Polefield site should not be considered for the decentralisation programme. Taking on board the recommendations we got, we proceeded to advertise for tenders for the decentralisation programme in Cork and we received a total of eight for this project. The assessment of these tenders will be completed shortly and the final decision will be made as quickly as possible.  In our final decision we will take into account the location, the contribution it can make to the development of the city and the design and suitability of the building for relocating a large number of public service staff.  In the interests of the taxpayer we will take into account the value for money which the investment will give, first, in the interests of providing a building and, second in ensuring the services are up to the standard which <Col N="327" /> the people of Cork would desire.  Deputy Allen can be in no doubt we will proceed and that we will make a decision.  I hope he and all the people of Cork, and particularly the public representatives will be satisfied that no matter where the building is located it will be in the interests of the people both of the city and county of Cork.</P>

      <P>The penal church in Cahirciveen is located among a series of houses on the north side of Market Cross between Cahirciveen's main street and the church and graveyard.  The building was noted in Smith's <i>Ancient and Present State of Kerry</i> published in 1756.  It had begun to function as a Catholic Church by 1822, when Thomas Reid, an English travel writer, described how it could only contain one-third of its usual congregation. By this time it was approaching the end of its period of use as a church since a larger one was being built near the site of the present Daniel O'Connell memorial church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point of interest concerning this building is that it was used as a Catholic church during the final half century of Ireland's infamous penal laws.  It facilitated the conversion of the Cahirciveen building to an ecclesiastical function and was under the patronage and protection of the local Catholic landlord family of the O'Connell's.  While there is no known record to substantiate the belief that Daniel O'Connell was baptised in this building, local historians are adamant that he was baptised there.  Indeed, as it was the only church in the locality it is almost certain he was baptised there.  In order to provide easy access to the proposed car park at Cahirciveen it has been proposed that this building should be demolished.  In my opinion, such a course of action would be both unfortunate and unnecessary, given the historical significance <Col N="328" /> and importance of the building. The church has two gothic windows and there were very few such penal churches in Kerry.</P>
    <P>In a letter dated 3 September 1990 to Kerry County Council the national monuments section of the Office of Public Works recommended that this structure should be retained and conserved and, if better access to the car park is needed, that the graveyard wall should be taken down and set back.  I suggest that no portion of this building should be removed or altered and that it should be retained and conserved both in the national and local interest.  The building should be treated with the proper respect that it is due and be preserved for the people of Cahirciveen as an important part of their heritage.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works will give consideration to the question of entering the Penal Church in Cahirciveen in the Register of Historic Monuments, as provided for under the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1987. This building is certainly of local historic interest in so far as the Catholic Emancipation Movement is concerned.  It is also reputed to be the baptismal place of the great Daniel O'Connell.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Deenihan, has said Kerry County Council are in the process of acquiring the building in connection with an off-street car parking development which they have planned.  The Commissioners of Public Works have written to Kerry County Council recommending that the Penal Church be preserved.  When the county council's response is to hand the matter will be considered further by the Commissioners.  I trust that this is to the satisfaction of both Deputy Deenihan and the people of County Kerry.</P>

      <P>I visited Irish troops in the Middle East, including Lebanon, Cyprus and Syria during the period 14-24 March 1992.</P>
      <P>In the course of my visit I met with the Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, the Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, the Cypriot Minister for Defence and the Force Commander of UNIFIL.  I spent four days with the Irish contingent serving with UNIFIL visiting 23 locations and saw at first hand the conditions under which Irish troops operate.  I was greatly impressed by their sense of commitment to the important work which they are undertaking in the cause of international peace and by the great rapport which exists between them and the local communities. Morale was uniformly high.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the presence of UNIFIL is vital to the stability of South Lebanon and affords protection and humanitarian assistance to the local population.  This fact was emphasised to me by a number of deputations which included Muktars and other leading representatives of several villages in the Irish area of operations.  They appealed strongly for the continued presence of Irish troops in South Lebanon.</P>

      <P>A total of 33 Irish personnel, including one soldier who is missing presumed dead, have died on service in Lebanon since 1978.  Of these, 15 were killed on duty and 18 died in accidents or from natural causes.  Twenty five members of the Permanent Defence Forces have been wounded while serving with UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>All incidents involving loss of life or serious injury of Irish UNIFIL personnel are investigated thoroughly both by the Irish contingent and by UNIFIL headquarters. Where possible, these investigations attribute cause and recommend possible ways of avoiding further casulaties. It is apparent from a review of the overall situation that the cause common to all cases of death and injury arising from duty in South Lebanon is related to the activities of the Israeli-backed militia, other armed elements and the Israeli Defence Forces.  All of these incidents have been the subject of protest at Government and diplomatic level and by the UNIFIL authorities to the Israeli Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>All developments affecting the safety of Irish personnel serving in UNIFIL are closely monitored and security procedures are continually reviewed.  Prior to departure on overseas service troops undergo a comprehensive training programme which is specifically designed to assist them in carrying out their peace-keeping duties with maximum protection. Personnel are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment. Operating procedures in Lebanon are geared to provide maximum safety for our troops.  Irish positions are defensively fortified and bunker facilities are provided for all personnel.  Every effort will continue to be made to ensure the greatest possible protection for our troops on overseas service.</P>

      <P>The review of the rationalisation of FCA units has not yet been concluded.</P>
      <P>The object of the exercise is to establish how the training and administration of the FCA might be carried out on a more cost effective basis.  As part of that process 45 Permanent Defence Forces officers who had been employed with the FCA on a part-time basis were withdrawn from such duties in September 1991.  In addition six officers who for various reasons were posted out of FCA units in 1991 were not replaced.  Apart from these 51 officers, no decision has been taken to transfer Permanent Defence Forces staff from any FCA unit.</P>

      <P>As at 31 December 1991 a shortfall of about £14.7 million in reimbursable entitlements from the United Nations had accumulated in respect of participation by personnel of the Permanent Defence Forces in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon and Cyprus.  Of this amount £13.9 million relates to involvement in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon since May 1978.  The remaining shortfall of £0.8 million arises out of participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus which commenced in April 1964.  The amounts outstanding at the end of 1989 and 1990 respectively were £19.6 million, and £16.6 million each, including £0.7 million in respect of participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus.</P>
      <P>The arrears in question are the subject of ongoing representations to the United Nations by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence, made both bilaterally and in conjunction with our partners in the European Community.</P>

      <Quest>the reason, in regard to the purchase of the Gulfstream Government jet, (1) offers of three aircraft companies who submitted tenders at a quarter of the cost of the Gulfstream were turned down, (2) the Dáil was not consulted before the purchase of this executive jet and (3) the Government Ministers cannot use scheduled air services to reach their destinations.</Quest>

      <P>Following a tender competition held in July 1990 for an executive jet aircraft a total <Col N="124" /> of 21 offers to supply various aircraft types was received.  A technical and commercial evaluation of these aircraft was subsequently conducted by representatives of the Department of Defence, the Air Corps, the Department of Tourism and Transport and Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to disclose details in regard to tenders received.  It was necessary, however, for the assessors to take numerous factors such as the overall quality, cost, capacity, technical capability and functional characteristics of each specific aircraft type into consideration.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the evaluation made and the requirements of the ministerial air transport service it was decided, on the basis of the most economical advantageous offer, to acquire the Gulfstream IV aircraft.  This decision was in accordance with the recommendations of the assessors.</P>
      <P>The Government had decided in June 1990 that an executive jet aircraft should be procured and provision was included in the Defence Estimate 1991 to cover the initial cost involved.  The Defence Estimate was agreed to by Dáil Éireann on 12 July 1991.  The aircraft is being acquired on the basis of a ten year lease arrangement, with an option to purchase.</P>
      <P>A ministerial air transport service was first provided in 1979 for Ireland's Presidency of the European Community. Experience since has shown that it is essential to have a suitable aircraft available for the conveyance on official business of Ministers and senior officials which allows for flexibility of use over commercial airlines and for the saving of valuable time.  It is also recognised that such a service ensures confidential communications and security and the ability to travel to destinations not regularly scheduled by commercial services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> The personal allowances are; married couple, £4,200; single person, £2,100; widow/widower, £2,600 and widowed parent, £1,600.</P>
    <P>It can be seen from the above that the special position of widowed persons is recognised in that the widowed person's allowance is higher than the single person's allowance.  In addition, widowed persons with children are also entitled to the widowed parent's allowance, which brings the total basic allowances of a widowed parent up to the same level as those of a married couple.</P>
    <P>Finally, in 1991, a special allowance for widowed parents with dependent children was introduced, to apply for the three tax years following the tax year in which the spouse dies.  The allowance is £1,500 for the first such year, £1,000 in the next and £500 in the year after.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100, 102, 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>Both the Dromore and Finn rivers are tributaries of the Erne catchment which was included, at No. 10, in the priority list of major catchments on which the national programme of arterial drainage is based.</P>
      <P>In 1970 a scheme for the part of the Erne lying entirely in the State and out-falling at Belturbet was prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works.  This scheme included the Dromore river. However, it was decided at the time to defer further consideration of the project on economic grounds, the cost of the work being totally incommensurate with the benefits to be derived.  There are no plans to revive activity on this scheme.</P>
      <P>In 1990 the design of a scheme for the Finn/Lacky subcatchment, which was not included in the 1970 proposals; was completed as part of an EC programme of cross-Border drainage.  Again, however, it was decided not to proceed with the scheme as it did not meet the appraisal criteria of either Government.</P>
      <P>Neither of the rivers in question is included in the interregional programme and the Commissioners of Public Works have no plans in relation to the development thereof as tourism amenities.  They are outside the limits of the Erne and Lough Oughter Navigation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the River Fane which flows through County Monaghan and into the sea just south of Dundalk, County Louth.  The river is included, at No. 20, on the priority list of minor catchments on which the national programme of arterial drainage is based. So far, however, it has not been reached in the programme so there is no survey data available.  Planning of all schemes was suspended in 1983 by Government decision.  Since then, the planning of four major schemes &mdash; the Suir, the Owenmore, the Mulkear and the Dunkellin &mdash; has been resumed.</P>
      <P>The river is not included as a project under the interregional programme and the Commissioners of Public Works have no plans in relation to its development as a tourism amenity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This allocation was made by the EC Commission under Council Decision 89/631/EEC towards the upgrading of Ireland's sea fisheries surveillance capability.  An earlier allocation of 5.77 MECU's was made to Ireland under that decision in 1991.  It is anticipated that over the five year period covered by the decision &mdash; 1991 to 1995 &mdash; Community contributions towards the provision of fisheries surveillance equipment will amount to 50 per cent of an estimated expenditure of 44.5 MECU's.</P>
      <P>This expenditure will be incurred in the provision of a range of surveillance related equipment for use by both my Department and the Department of Defence.  The equipment being purchased includes two maritime patrol aircraft, communications and data handling systems, land vehicles, specialised photographic equipment, satellite monitoring equipment and computers and associated software.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the Community funding will make a major contribution <Col N="138" /> towards enhancing Ireland's fisheries surveillance services both at sea and on land and thus contribute towards the conservation and protection of valuable fish stocks in Irish waters.</P>

      <P>The junior certificate syllabuses for French and German are the same syllabuses that were introduced for those subjects for the intermediate certificate examination in 1986.  At this stage teachers can be expected to be familiar with them.  The junior certificate has introduced a second level, the ordinary level, based on those syllabuses to cater for pupils who would be over-stretched by the full requirements of the intermediate certificate.  The ordinary level in junior certificate French and German is, therefore, a less demanding version of the intermediate certificate in those subjects. The requirements of the ordinary level were illustrated in the sample papers in French and German that were issued to the schools some time ago.  Various in-service courses have been held in these subjects since the revised syllabuses were introduced and teachers will benefit, <i>inter alia,</i> from discussion of the differentiation between ordinary and higher levels at the forthcoming in-service sessions.</P>

      <P>As the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, has not yet been commenced, no nursing homes have been inspected under the new nursing homes legislation. Under the Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1985, health boards are obliged to inspect private nursing homes every six months to ensure compliance with the standards of accommodation and care set out in the regulations.  Health boards are providing advice to nursing homes when requested on the implications of the new nursing legislation for <Col N="147" /> standards of care and accommodation in nursing homes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Questions No. 26 of 5 February 1992 which sets out the range of legislative controls applying or proposed in relation to incineration.  It is proposed shortly to specify emission limit values for large combustion plants in line with the requirements of Directive 88/609/EEC.  While there are no immediate proposals to prescribe emission limit values for other kinds of incineration, new incinerators for solid or liquid wastes are subject to licensing control of emissions under the Air Pollution Act, 1987. It is a matter for plant operators and manufacturers to ensure that the design criteria for particular incineration plant meet pollution control requirements of licences or emission limit values.</P>
      <P>Waste incineration will become subject to integrated pollution control under the Environmental Protection Agency Bill when enacted.  A draft Directive on the incineration of hazardous wastes, which includes proposed emission limit values to apply on a Community-wide basis, has recently been approved by the European Commission and will be considered by the Council in due course.</P>

      <P>The Government have been following recent developments in Peru with great concern.  Over the past year the Sendero Luminoso or Shining Path guerillas are reported to have carried out over 20,000 terrorist attacks.  This has led to a state of emergency being introduced in many parts of the country, which in turn has given rise to serious concern about human rights.</P>
      <P>In response to this situation the Peruvian Government have recently adopted a number of measures including the establishment of the &ldquo;Consejo Por La Paz&rdquo; or Council for Peace, a broadly based civilian group charged with drafting a national peace accord, and with recommending ways of strengthening the Public Prosecutions Department and the criminal justice system.  In addition, a Government decree has been adopted allowing unrestricted access by public prosecutors and the Red Cross to detention centres controlled by the armed forces in areas where the state of emergency is in force.</P>
      <P>The Peruvian Government have also invited the Organisation of American States' Inter-American Commission for Human Rights to visit Peru and to compile a report on the human rights situation there.  Ireland, together with partners in the Twelve, strongly supports efforts at the regional level to solve problems in the region.  We therefore welcome the invitation to the Organsiation of American States to send its Human Rights Commission to the area.</P>
      <P>Ireland has not received an invitation from the Peruvian Government to send a mission to Peru.  However, we are concerned about the situation there and we will be following closely all developments arising from the latest measures adopted by the Peruvian authorities as well as the report of the Organisation of American States' Human Rights Commission.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for an old age contributory pension <Col N="164" /> in July 1991.  He was subsequently awarded pension of £108.70 per week with effect from 12 April 1991 &mdash; three months prior to the date he lodged his application.  Pension was awarded at the minimum personal rate and it included allowances in respect of an adult and child dependant.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that contributory pensions may be back-dated three months prior to the date of receipt of the pension application.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where good cause is shown for not previously claiming pension, may payment be back-dated beyond three months.</P>
      <P>The submission of the completion form SE1 by the person concerned in November 1988 has no bearing on the backdating of the pension award.  This document, which relates to the registration of self-employed persons for pay-related social insurance purposes, cannot be regarded as an application for old age contributory pension or as notification of a person's wish to apply for pension.</P>
      <P>A formal decision regarding entitlement to any pension or allowance can only be made when a fully completed application form is submitted to the Department.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the application for pension cannot be back-dated further than three months in this case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned became unemployed in 1986 and subsequently exhausted her entitlement to unemployment benefit on 1 June 1987 and continued to <Col N="166" /> sign for credited contributions up to 19 September 1989.  A signing docket was sent to her in the usual way for completion in respect of the week ended 26 September 1989.  When she failed to return this docket no further dockets were issued to her as is the usual practice. In September 1991 she was in touch with the Department's office in Tralee and asked to be allowed sign the unemployed register retrospectively for the previous two years.  Permission to sign retrospectively was not granted on the grounds that, (a) she indicated that she had not made any efforts to look for work in the period in question and (b) she did not contact the Department at any time in that two year period to have her position clarified.  It is a condition for the award of credits that a person be unemployed, available for work and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned is currently signing for credited contributions which will continue to be awarded provided she fulfils the necessary conditions.</P>

      <P>Free travel under my Department's scheme is available to all persons resident in the State who are aged 66 years and over and also to certain incapacitated persons.  The husband or wife of the pensioner may also travel free when accompanying the free travel passholder.  Spouses over the age of 66 qualify for a free travel pass in their own right.</P>
      <P>The question of allowing a spouse under the age of 66 to travel free of charge independently of the passholder would have significant implications for the financing of the free travel scheme and could only be considered if the necessary resources were available.</P>
