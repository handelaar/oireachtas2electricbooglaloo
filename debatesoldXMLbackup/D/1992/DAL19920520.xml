      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will have learned this morning, with deep regret, of the death of James Tully, a former distinguished Member of this House. Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>Jimmy Tully was first elected to the Dáil for Meath in 1954; with the exception of the period from 1957-61 he was a Member of this House until the end of January 1982. He was Minister for Local Government from 1973-77 and Minister for Defence from June 1981 to March 1982. He was Labour Party Whip from 1961-69 and Deputy Leader of the Labour Parliamentary party for many years. He served in the Defence Forces from 1941-46 and Deputies will recall it was as Minister for Defence while attending official ceremonies in Egypt in 1981 that he was wounded on the occasion of the assassination of President Sadat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Meath will be particularly saddened this morning in view of the tremendous service he gave to that county over the years. He was a member of the county council from 1955-73. Senior Members will recall that the former Deputy assiduously attended this House. I want to take this opportunity on my own behalf, on behalf of the Government and the House, to extend <Col N="1982" /> our deepest sympathy to the family of James Tully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was shocked to hear in the last half hour of the death of Jimmy Tully. His loss will be felt very deeply in County Meath; he was one of the best &mdash; if not the best &mdash; Ministers for Local Government who ever served. Thousands and thousands of families live in comfortable housing today and they would not be so accommodated if it had not been for the energy and vigour which Jimmy Tully showed as Minister for Local Government in promoting public housing and in facilitating people in building their own houses.</P>
      <P>He also showed, as the Taoiseach correctly identified, immense personal and physical courage when his life was under direct threat when President Sadat of Egypt was assassinated. As Minister for Defence he showed immense concern for the conditions of those working in the Army, particularly enlisted soldiers. In that concern he was drawing on his own personal experience as he had served in the Army. Jimmy Tully never ceased to be an old soldier in the sense that he had at all times an overriding sense of public service and duty which drove everything he did. He carried that tremendous characteristic, which service in the Army gives to people, to his work in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a deeply committed trade unionist, representing rural workers, whose interests had been neglected over many years. He served them very well and all those who negotiated with him also recognised that he was concerned to find a commonsense solution to problems rather than one based on a clash of irreconcilable ideas. It was that practical commonsense and utter intolerance of humbug or theory of any kind which made him such a successful member of Government. With maybe one or two exceptions &mdash; and even that would be stretching it &mdash; he was responsible for the success of the Coalition Governments of 1973-77 and 1981-82. He brought his practical, commonsense and the &ldquo;forget about the theory, what can we do to solve the problem&rdquo; approach to his work as a <Col N="1983" /> Cabinet Minister. He provided the cement in the two Governments which made them the success I contend they were.</P>
    <P>As a member of Fine Gael, as someone who served with him in the Dáil representing County Meath &mdash; and in the same Government &mdash; I feel not just a deep sense of loss but a personal gratitude to Jimmy Tully for what he did for all of us and for the country. I speak as the Leader of a party who worked in close co-operation with Jimmy Tully for most of his public life but I also speak as one of the five representatives of the constituency of Meath. I know I speak for all my colleagues in Meath when I say that our constituents &mdash; no matter what way they may have voted &mdash; will feel today's news as being in a true sense a personal loss. People in Meath will feel they have lost somebody to whom they could turn when perhaps there was no one else to turn to.</P>
    <P>Though Jimmy Tully ceased to be an active public representative some time ago, he continued to help people with their practical difficulties and to offer his advice to them in every way. As I said, he was somebody whom I felt to be among my personal friends and I feel his loss greatly as indeed I felt the loss not so long ago of his late wife, Mary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with great personal shock and surprise and, indeed, sadness that I learnt this morning of the death of Jimmy Tully. All my parliamentary party colleagues were shocked to hear of his sudden demise.</P>
      <P>Jimmy Tully was an extraordinary man, as you, A Cheann Comhairle, would readily testify. He served his country and his constituents of Meath for more than 20 years in this House. He was Whip of the Labour Party, which is a hard task at any time, for more than eight years and he was deputy leader of the party, perhaps an even harder task, for six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jimmy Tully was ruthless in debate. He took no prisoners, he gave no compromises, he argued right out to the <Col N="1984" /> very end and when the debate was over there was not the slightest shred of personal animosity. He debated ideas, and issues, he did not debate personalities. He was a man of boundless generosity.</P>
    <P>He came into politics in perhaps the best way, from his own direct experience, the rural squalor of Meath, the isolation and the degradation of rural farm workers and the hovels within which they had to live. Those hovels produced TB, disease and early death.</P>
    <P>Jimmy Tully was without question &mdash; I say this as a local councillor, an architect and a politician &mdash; the best Minister responsible for housing this country has ever had. He will never be forgotten because there are many examples of his work across the countryside of this State. Nothing was too good for local authority tenants and the best was not good enough to be put into the materials that built the houses in which people now live and rear families. Those houses are along the quays of this city and opposite the Custom House where he served for five years as Minister for Local Government. His passion and commitment to local authority housing knew no bounds and his belief that everybody had the right to build his or her own house and to live in it is, as Deputy Bruton said, a testimony that can be witnessed daily by everybody around this country.</P>
    <P>Jimmy Tully will be missed particularly by the people of Meath. He will be missed by his colleagues in the trade union movement and the rural workers union, which he successfully led for so long and which is now an integral part of SIPTU, the largest union in the country. He will be missed by his family, by his sons, daughters and grandchildren, to whom he was a tower of strength all his time as a working politician. He will be missed very much by me because out of our clash at the beginning of my political career he became a confidante, a friend and someone in whom I placed a great deal of trust and from whom I received much advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know Jimmy Tully personally. I did know him indirectly through various activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> There is no doubt that his contribution to public life was not inconsiderable. As a number of speakers said, the enduring monument to Jimmy Tully will be the housing he provided in the seventies when he was Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>His life was spent in public service, between his time in the Defence Forces, in the trade union movement, in local and national politics. As with anyone engaged in public life, his actions were not always without public controversy. However, what he did, particularly for people who had no housing, will stand to him. On behalf of the Democratic Left, I convey our sympathy to Jimmy Tully's family and his friends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats Party I should like to join the Taoiseach and other Members in expressing our sincere sympathy to the family of the late Jimmy Tully and in paying tribute to his hard work and dedication.</P>
      <P>During his years as a Member of this House he fought a good battle on all of the causes that he espoused. It is true to say that the record of the House will show that I crossed swords with him on many occasions during those years but at all times I retained great respect for his dedication to the cause he believed in and the tremendous energy he brought to the tasks he was asked to perform in Government and for his party in the House as a spokesperson.</P>
      <P>On this sad occasion of Jimmy Tully's death, I should like to extend a very special word of sympathy to his family and relatives. He will not be forgotten by his friends and those whom he may have considered his former enemies in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;'Council Directive' means Council Directive of 27th June, 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (85/337/EEC);'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am most anxious that we reach sections with which we did not have the opportunity to deal on Committee Stage, although we had a reasonable debate at that time. I hope the Minister has availed of the opportunity between Committee Stage and Report Stage to look at the amendments, all of which have been put forward in a spirit of being constructive, in the hope of having the best possible Bill and to strike the balance we require between efficient and fair planning mechanisms in which everyone has confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1994" /> I hope the Minister will look at later amendments which may not be formally reached between now and the conclusion of the debate this evening and will be willing to accept reasonable amendments.</P>
    <P>We had a short discussion on this amendment on Committee Stage which simply seeks to define the term of &ldquo;Council Directive&rdquo;. Although reference is made to the Council directive in the Bill it does not specify which Council directive the Minister has in mind. It is important to ensure that there is a degree of clarity in all legislation which goes through this House. We should spell out which Council directive the Minister has in mind so that people and, in particular, lawyers who read legislation will be easily able to equate the wording in the Bill with the legislation or directive the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister said previously that it would be self-evident which directive he had in mind. It is important that we do not just assume that things are self-evident. We need to ensure that, in so far as possible, the legislation we put on the Statute Book is clear. It is for that reason I retabled this amendment on Report Stage.</P>

Deputy Howlin said he was anxious that we would reach sections with which we did not deal on Committee Stage. I hope Deputy Howlin will facilitate the House in this respect by not pressing his amendment. I have double-checked the position from a legal point of view and I have nothing more to add to what I said on Committee Stage. The Deputy's proposal is incorporated in the main body of legislation and there is no legal need for it in this instance. I have looked at the issue on that basis and I <Col N="1995" /> can assure the Deputy that that is the position.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;'prescribe' means prescribe by regulations;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical drafting amendment which will insert a definition of the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; in section 2.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`publication' means a notice published in a newspaper which has general circulation in the area of the proposed development.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Howlin, I am anxious that we proceed to deal with those sections of the Bill with which we did not deal on Committee Stage. The House will recall that on Committee Stage Members on this side of the House were most unhappy that a guillotine was introduced which resulted in our dealing with only two of the 22 sections in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having re-read the Bill in the intervening period in preparation for Report Stage, I have to confess that it has not grown on me. I remain adamant that this Bill is horrific legislation which will <Col N="1996" /> greatly limit the rights of the public in the making of planning appeals and will tilt the balance of advantage in the area of planning appeals in favour of the developer to the disadvantage of third parties which includes individual citizens and local communities.</P>
    <P>My amendment was discussed on Committee Stage. On that occasion the Minister accepted that there was a difficulty in relation to the formula in the Bill for the notification of planning decisions, particularly to third parties, and the period of time allowed for people to put in appeals. The Bill provides that in the case of the planning applicant there will be a period of one month from the date on which the applicant receives notification of the decision and in the case of a third party there will be a period of one month running from the date on which the decision is made by the planning authority, in other words the planning decision.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has tabled an amendment which proposes that the same one month period should apply in the case of the applicant as in the case of any other party; in other words, it would run from the date on which the planning decision is made by the planning authority. While this would be an improvement, it does not deal with the situation whereby many members of the public may not be aware that a planning decision has been made. The normal method for notifying the public of a planning decision is through the publication by the local authority of planning lists which are circulated through the post to members of local authorities and residents' associations who have requested that they be sent to them. The first problem which may arise is a delay in the issuing of the planning lists. On Committee Stage I instanced complaints which had been made by, for example, An Taisce, who point out that in the case of some local authorities it can take two or three weeks after the planning decision is made before the planning lists are circulated. This effectively leaves only a period of about one or two weeks within which the resident's associations or individual citizens <Col N="1997" /> can make their appeal. Under the provisions of the Bill, they will be required to state the full terms of their appeal. That period of time is clearly too short.</P>
    <P>It is probably appropriate in the middle of a postal strike to point out that if this Bill were already in force the reality is that people would not be in a position to know whether a planning decision had been made as the entire system is dependent on the postal system. I am proposing in my amendment that that system be replaced by a system which would require the local authority to publish in a newspaper circulated in their area a notice listing the planning decisions they have made. There is precedent for this. In the first case, the planning applicant has to advertise in a newspaper giving notice of his intention to make a planning application.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, for a variety of reasons, regularly use public notices to inform the public about some course of action they propose to take. For example, if the local authority have to carry out essential repair work on water supplies or some other essential service, it is normal that they place a public notice either in the local newspaper circulating in the area or, in some cases, in the national newspaper to notify the public of what they are doing. I am proposing that the local authority be required to publish in the local newspapers a list of the planning decisions made so that the public will know that decisions have been made and will not be dependent on the archaic system whereby notices are posted on a small noticeboard outside the offices of the planning authority or dependent on the postal service which, as we know at present, to our cost, does not always function or perhaps in which notices may get lost.</P>
    <P>This legislation provides very restricted means by which people can make their appeal to An Bord Pleanála. The appeal, together with a full statement, must be received within a month and people will not be allowed to add to that subsequently. If they miss the month deadline there is no provision whereby they can have a second chance to appeal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> The problem arises in that members of the public and residents' associations in particular may not know that a planning decision has been made and, therefore, may not be in a position to make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála. We cannot rely on the system that operates at present whereby, first, planning lists are often delayed in being issued, second, they may be delayed in the post and, third, members of the public may not see the notices. The only way to avoid that is to require the planning authority to publish notices in the newspaper. If we are to have a planning appeals system which is very restrictive, allowing very little time for people to appeal, and which will not allow the public an opportunity of a second chance to appeal, at the very least there should be a very open and transparent system of notification that a planning decision has been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would very much like to support the amendment in the name of Deputy Gilmore. The onus is on the Minister for the Environment, in trying to speed up the planning process, to facilitate the public by providing information speedily. I would go further than Deputy Gilmore because notices about planning decisions, planning applications and planning appeals may appear in different parts of newspapers at various times and, therefore, people might not observe them. The local authority should be required to publish all planning applications within a week of their receipt, all planning decisions within a week of their being made, and all planning appeals within a week of their being lodged. Those notices should be, as far as is possible, on the same page of the same paper each week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present it is much too easy to make a planning application without it being brought to the attention of the public. There is not a general practice in relation to lodging a notice in newspapers about planning applications. There is no requirement, as far as I know, to put notices in the paper to the effect that a planning appeal has been lodged. Only this week in my constituency I spotted <Col N="1999" /> a planning appeal two days before the deadline and the people who would be very much affected by the appeal and may have wished to put forward the opposite point of view almost lost the opportunity to lodge a counter appeal.</P>
    <P>There is also the ruse of publishing notices, as required, in the Irish language. It is extraordinary that Irish place names are, in many cases, variable. For instance, there are some incredible translations of street names to be seen in Dublin. On one end of a street one version of a street name may appear while a few hundred yards away a different version is to be seen. People can be easily confused by planning notices which appear in obscure parts of papers, sometimes in the Irish language. That is why I would go further than what is proposed in Deputy Gilmore's amendment. First, notices not only of planning applications but also of planning decisions and planning appeals should be published within a week of the event in the same part of the newspaper that has wide circulation in the local authority area concerned. There should also be a requirement that where an application is lodged in the Irish language an English language summary should accompany it. We must be realistic: many people do not have a working knowledge of the Irish language and place names in Irish can be very different from the English version. For example, Church Street in my constituency appears in two different Irish names on each side of the street, one is Sráid an Teampaill and the other is Sráid na hEaglaise.</P>

      <P>There are more incredible translations to be seen such as Bessborough Road, which is translated at one point to read Bothar Beasbra, whereas at another point it reads Bóthar Besbra. I am sure the same is the case in ancient townlands around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2000" /> For instance, the town where my wife comes from, Newbridge, County Galway, is indicated on some road signs as Droichead Nua while others give the ancient Irish name of Gort an Iomaire. Therefore, these are valid points and the Minister should go further than is proposed by Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    <P>I would also go further than publishing notices in newspapers. It is incumbent on those making planning applications to ensure that there is a highly visible sign with, in some cases, depending on size and location of the site or building for which the application is made, a clear colour, design, lay-out and size which people understand as a planning notice, giving notice to people living in the vicinity of the site that there is a planning application or appeal in process in relation to that site. A greater effort must be made to give the public who may be affected by the planning application or appeal more notice so that their interests are protected and their rights are not forfeited merely because they missed the new and tighter deadlines. I would urge the Minister to accept Deputy Gilmore's proposal and perhaps to go further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment. It is one of the issues that is important enough for us to focus in on, although we did so on Committee Stage. The general thrust of the Bill is to strike a balance between the rights of individual or community objectors and the rights of developers. The developer will continue to have the advantage if this Bill is enacted. One small measure that could be taken by the Minister to redress the imbalance would be to accept the amendment before him. I thought we reached consensus on Committee Stage that the scrappy way notification is given is not in the best interest of the public's right to know and that if we established in a local newspaper a page every week listing planning decisions, people would readily know where to go for the information, would read it as a matter of course and would be clued in to what is happening in thier own area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about empowering communities. <Col N="2001" /> Surely the essence of empowerment in relation to controlling the environment one lives in, is to have a say in the built environment around one. The right of individuals and community groups to impact on the environment will be greatly circumscribed by this legislation. A mechanism can be used to tilt the balance more correctly if the Minister accepted the amendment. Although the amendment does not specifically state it, there should be one page in a recognised newspaper where all planning decisions are detailed. This amendment is important enough for the Minister to give serious consideration to it. We have kneejerk reactions from many Ministers rejecting suggestions from the Opposition and then constructing an argument to defeat them. That was the approach on many Bills and we made very little progress on them, while we made progress on Bills when the Minister was forthcoming and accepted good ideas, even if they came from the Opposition. A positive response to amendments would be in the best interests of the people and the legislative process.</P>
    <P>The publication of notices as Gaeilge, is sometimes seen as a ruse to allow as few people as possible understand what is happening. It would be desirable if notices as Gaeilge had to be translated into English. As previous speakers said, there are peculiar name places and peculiar Irish translations of them. Coimisiún na Logainmeacha could look into some of them. There is a big development area in Wexford called Coolcotts which is an anglicisation of an Irish name but, rather than using the Irish derivative what has happened is that Coolcotts was translated literally into Gaeilge so it is now Na Botha Fuaire. That is the sort of peculiar situation that arises. There are such examples up and down the country. This should be looked at.</P>
    <P>In relation to the net point of this amendment, to make the public aware of what is happening, we should facilitate that as much as possible. It would be one way of addressing the imbalance that will be in place if this legislation is enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is time someone said it here. We must make a real effort to get through this Bill today, and not finish the debate on amendment No. 15 or No. 20, as occurred before. It is all very well to complain about Bills being guillotined, and I agree that sometimes they are guillotined, but there is too much repetition in this House and rehashing of a debate which we had a few weeks previously. I will not waste the time of the House in rehashing the arguments I put forward the last time. No Deputy has referred to my amendment which, perhaps indicates that people think one newspaper is enough. The only difference between the two amendments is that I proposed two newspapers. The balance of advantage lies with two rather one because every possible effort must be made to inform local people of what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to advertisements as Gaeilge, while all Members would wish to encourage the use of the Irish language, advertisements as Gaeilge are seen as a cyncial exercise by developers to put people off the scent. A case could be made for requiring all planning advertisements as Gaeilge to be repeated in English. If that was the situation there would be very few advertisements as Gaeilge. The reality that a large number of people are not very fluent in the Irish language must be faced and those people <Col N="2003" /> are being done a grave disservice by this trick being pulled by developers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Garland's comments about wanting to deal with all sections. That is what we all wish and I will try to facilitate the House by confining my remarks as much as possible, even though I have been taunted a little by the continuing reference to this tilting the balance in favour of the developer. In one area we are increasing the appeal time from three to four weeks. Last night we had a debate about urban renewal and we could have up to £100 million of such projects in different stages of planning. What is planning and development about? It is about jobs, renewal and development. In the course of the debate on Second Stage Deputies on all sides accepted that.</P>
      <P>It is important in our approach to this Bill that we do not slavishly say it is in favour of the developer and against somebody who has a legitimate right to object. Having looked at appeals systems throughout Europe, I have concluded that by any stretch of the imagination, we have a very fair and balanced system. The definitions which these amendments seek to insert in section 1 are for the purposes of a reformulation of the definition of the appeal period set out in section 3. However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to relate the commencement of the appeal period to publication of notice of the planning authority's decision. I will be proposing an amendment to section 3, the effect of which will be that the appeal period would run for all, from the day of the planning authority's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters relating to notice have always been dealt with by way of regulations. It is not the practice of this House to deal with these matters by way of primary legislation. I am well aware of the need for good public notice requirements and I will take account of the matters raised by Deputies when we are preparing the regulations. It may be necessary not only to have a public notice in a newspaper but to have a notice displayed on the site. <Col N="2004" /> We must also take account of the fact that a huge number of people do not buy newspapers. We have to find a way to make communication, and the system, as transparent as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies have made good solid points. I have no real argument against the need to have the system as transparent as possible. We have to work at this through regulations. It is not a matter for primary legislation. I hope the regulations will ensure that the public see the system as fair and as transparent as possible. I have to reject the amendments as they are not essential and it has not been the practice of this House to deal with matters of this specific nature in primary legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument that the appropriate place to deal with this point is not in primary legislation but in regulations. The types of thing that regulations can deal with relate to the mechanism for making appeals, the type of forms to be used and so on. This is a critical issue. The whole Bill hinges on two things, first, the publication of the decision and then that everybody must lodge an appeal within a month, together with all evidence, documents and requests for an oral hearing. Then An Bord Pleanála must make a decision, except in certain exceptional cases, within four months. The period of one month starts the process. If an appeal is not lodged within that time, it will not be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to getting on with the debate. Our purpose is to ensure that whatever legislation is passed is good legislation and we must protect the public against bad legislation. This is bad legislation in that it limits the rights of the public. If it takes me a couple of minutes to reinforce the point I have been making about this period of one month and the need for public notice, so be it. I have come across cases in the course of my work as a public representative where the public have missed out on making appeals. Under this legislation that will be compounded. I have come across a case where a person went on holidays and by the time he returned the planning <Col N="2005" /> authority had made a decision to allow a factory to put a 12-foot wall, effectively the equivalent of a handball alley, at the back of his house, but it was too late to make an appeal. I have also come across cases of what I call the Christmas and the August trap. Planning applications are submitted on 24 December in the knowledge that meetings of the local authority will not take place during the Christmas recess. The same thing happens in August. Applications are lodged on the Friday before the bank holiday weekend. The applicants know that people will be on holidays and that there will not be meetings of the local authorities. A clever applicant will submit his application so that the decision will coincide with a holiday period and people will not be aware of the decision. They will thus be prevented from making an appeal within the required one-month period.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said he is prepared to consider my proposal in the context of regulations but we never debate regulations in this House. Very often it takes <Col N="2006" /> quite some time before regulations are drawn up. The publication of the local authority's decision on a planning issue is central to this Bill. Everything else hinges on the public being aware of that information. I appreciate that the Minister in providing the same month for the applicant as for third parties is levelling the playing pitch to some extent. It must be borne in mind, however, that the applicant will be watching for the notification of the decision from the local authority. A member of the public might not be aware that the application had been made in the first place. Most members of the public never see the lists published by local authorities. Many residents associations do not get them, while in other areas residents are not organised. The publication of the notice is critical to allow people a democratic opportunity to make an appeal. It is an issue of principle. It is not something that can be dealt with by way of regulation. It is a matter for primary legislation.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 40, after &ldquo;may be&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to proper planning and environmental considerations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (1) sets out, as it were, the mission statement, &mdash; what we want An Bord Pleanála to do. The statement in that subsection is a little short in relation to the environmental responsibilities of the board. Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Board to ensure that appeals and other matters with which it is concerned are disposed of as expeditiously as may be and, for that purpose, to take all such steps as are open to it to ensure that in so far as is practicable, there are no avoidable delays at any stage in the determination of appeals and other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That bold statement should be tempered and I propose to insert after &ldquo;may be&rdquo; the words &ldquo;subject to proper planning and environmental considerations&rdquo;. I know the Minister will say this is self-evident, that the board have to have regard to environmental matters. It is <Col N="2009" /> essential that we actually state that we are subjugating everything to the notion that it is environmentally sound and we should not seek in a bold sense a decision as expeditiously as may be, regardless of the consequences. That seems to be the implication of what is contained in that subsection. We had a discussion on Committee Stage in relation to this matter. It is important, so that people will feel confident, that proper environmental considerations are taken into account as a matter of routine and as a matter of legislative priority and that we put this new phrase into this subsection. I strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputies will accept the assurance I gave on the last occasion and again to the House today, that the words in the amendment are entirely unnecessary from either a legal or a practical viewpoint. The board's general duty in section 2 (1) of the Bill is identical to their existing duty under section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983. That duty has been in operation for nine years without compromising the board's duty or ability to deal with appeals in accordance with considerations of proper planning and development. Besides, the board's obligation to decide cases on the basis of criteria of proper planning is already clearly spelled out in planning law. Section 26 (1) and (5) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, laid down that the board's decision must be taken in the light of proper planning and development of the area concerned, regard being had, among other things, to the provisions of the development plan and any relevant special amenity area order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at the apparent contradiction that Deputies' contributions seem to reveal. On the one hand, there is a fairly general acceptance that there is an important public interest in having <Col N="2010" /> expeditious decisions on planning appeals and, on the other hand, Deputies are seeking to modify a legal duty of efficiency which has been in existence since 1983 and which has clearly posed no problems for the board in terms of dealing with cases in a fair and thorough manner. I do not believe the Bill would be improved in any way by that amendment and accordingly I must decline to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taken aback by the attitude of the Minister to this amendment. Rather than suggesting that Members on this side of the House are contradictory in their stances I think what the Minister said was contradictory in itself. He said there is no necessity for the amendment because it is already embodied in legislation as a whole and that these considerations are taken into account by An Bord Pleanála as a matter of routine on foot of legislation already in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time he suggested that the amendment seeks to modify the legal duty to efficiency. It either has an effect or it has not. If it has no effect then why is the Minister resisting it? If it has the effect that the Minister now suggests, that it modifies the legal duty of efficiency of the board, and if that modification is a requirement to take proper planning and development and environmental considerations into account it is one that would be supported by the majority in this House and, indeed, by the majority of people. I have said consistently I am fearful of sections of this Bill although I have no objection to the general principle. I have no objection, neither do I think many people in this House would object, to the principle of making the planning and appeal procedures more efficient. There is no problem in building a consensus around that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of the difficulties between the Government side and the Opposition in relation to this Bill is the balance between the rights of developers and people who <Col N="2011" /> want to create jobs, put buildings in place and continue the ongoing development of the built environment. That is good, but sometimes their rights are in conflict with the rights of neighbourhood groups and individuals who also have rights that have to be vindicated by legislation. In trying to strike a balance between the two we are running into difficulties with the Minister. I do not think there is any contradiction in striving to seek that balance. It is not a contradiction to state that we want efficiency but we do not want to completely deprive individuals, groups and environmentally concerned people of their rights to scrutinise and object, where necessary, to any development. For that reason I am dismayed by the Minister's response to this amendment and I would like to push it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 1, to delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the period within which An Bord Pleanála are required to give their decision on the appeal. Under the provisions of the Bill the proposal is that An Bord Pleanála would give their decision within a period of four months, beginning on the date of receipt of the appeal. The amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six&rdquo;, in other words, that An Bord Pleanála would have to make their decision within six months. I do not think anybody in the House wants to argue that An Bord Pleanála should take a long time to decide appeals. We would all like to see appeals dealt with expeditiously. However, there are two considerations. <Col N="2012" /> First, as was stated on a number of occasions on Second and Committee Stages the delays by An Bord Pleanála are not caused by the absence of a time limit in legislation but due to a lack of resources in An Bord Pleanála. It does not seem appropriate to deal with this by simply putting down a time limit and then not providing resources to back that up. That will create circumstances where bad decisions will be made by An Bord Pleanála. The board, with their limited resources, will be told they must make a decision within four months whether they have the time and the resources to seriously examine the appeal. Where An Bord Pleanála are under pressure bad decisions will be made.</P>
    <P>Second, we know there are circumstances where, because an environment impact statement or some other complicated factor will be necessary, An Bord Pleanála will take longer than four months to determine an appeal. In the normal course of events an appeal in relation to the building of a house or a small development should not take a great deal of time to decide. However, there are complex, controversial planning applications with major implications for local communities and the local environment which, of necessity, will take longer than four months to determine on appeal. The argument here is that four months is too short. If there must be a time limit, we suggest it should be six months. That does not mean that every appeal must take six months to determine; if it is possible to determine an appeal within one to two months, let it be determined in that period. The limit of four months is too short and should be extended to six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat what Deputy Gilmore said nor to repeat what those on this side of the House said on Committee Stage. This is a very important provision, probably the key provision in the Bill, and there seems to be no sign of any give by the Minister which I find very disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2013" /> Amendment No. 10 in my name seeks to extend the time limit to nine months in cases where an environment impact statement has been submitted because, whereas, six months is probably a reasonable period for the average planning appeal very complex planning appeals regarding major schemes where environment impact statements are required will require further consideration by the board. Therefore, nine months is appropriate. One can argue about whether it should be eight months, ten months or one year but the balance would be struck by setting the time limit at nine months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how the Government and Opposition differ on how to create employment, we all agreed that we must remove some of the present barriers. If I supported the amendment I would be supporting an attempt to wipe out one of the major keystones of the Bill, that is, the speedy, effective and efficient processing of appeals against the planning process. I cannot see the sense in extending the period to nine months, as Deputy Garland suggested and cannot support the proposed extension to six months either. I hope the Minister will ensure that An Bord Pleanála get the resources to deal with planning appeals speedily and fairly. If we were to support this amendment we would be eliminating one of the key factors in grappling with unemployment. From now all decisions in this House must relate to our attempts to get rid of this scourge on our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's proposals that a four months limitation be applied to the appeals procedure of An Bord Pleanála because of the inordinate delays on the part of the board in dealing with appeals. We can point to the fact that the resources have not been available to the board to deal more speedily with planning appeals. I assume that if the Minister imposes this limit on the board he will ensure that there will be no lack of resources. Those of us who are members of local authorities and on planning committees of local authorities know that <Col N="2014" /> investigations of plans take place mostly at local level and that time extensions are granted regularly so that the procedures can be gone through. The time limits are rarely adhered to if there are complications in the plans. An extension is granted when there is a reasonable request and it is usually a further two months.</P>
      <P>At the moment it can take up to one year to get planning permission on foot of fairly innocuous plans for a bungalow or some such structure if there are objections. My county has the most difficult planning section of any county council and that is because we are concerned about the environment and we have a development plan. There are often applications concerning areas that are environmentally sensitive and the council examine these thoroughly. Some appeals could be described as frivolous and that means not only a delay in dealing with the planning application but extra expense for the person who has submitted the application due to changing rates and increases in the cost of building materials and so on.</P>
      <P>All of us accept that every plan submitted should be thoroughly investigated to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Planning Act and the development plan adopted by the council. Given the resources available to An Bord Pleanála, it should be possible for the board to do this and make a decision within the period of four months. As I said, the work is being done and certain members of the staff have been assigned to carry out various tasks. If the workload in a particular area is heavy it is up to chairman of An Bord Pleanála to assign additional staff to meet the deadlines imposed on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, has however, given them a way out in section 2. This is a source of concern to me. While it may not be used, given the time limit imposed on the board, the section states that appeals should be disposed of &ldquo;as expeditiously as may be&rdquo;. Does this mean that there will be exceptions to the rule in relation to the period of four months? On occasion there may be. I am aware of one scheme <Col N="2015" /> costing £46 million which may come before the board &mdash; I do not want to name it here because with a bit of wisdom at local level they will ensure that it will not and which could not be dealt with within the period of four months. While there will be exceptions to the rule I hope they will not become the rule and the board will not claim that they do not have the staff or the expertise to deal with a complicated plan and that this will not filter down, as I said, to even the most innocuous of plans in respect of which the decision is appealed to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála should have no difficulty in meeting the deadline of four months. If we were to propose a figure of two months somebody else would suggest eight months. It is only right, therefore, that the Minister should lay down a rigid timescale which, as far as possible, should be adhered to.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies for their support because this amounts to the nuts and bolts of what we are trying to achieve. Let me say to Deputy Gilmore and others who are worried about the figure of four months that it defies logic to suggest that time is always a factor in making good decisions. During a period of four to six months one could have negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty, five or six general elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to dispel the belief that it is not possible to do within four months what can only be done right in six months. I do not think that argument stands up.</P>
      <P>We have to address the questions of efficiency, fairness, tolerance and systems. Deputy Gilmore hinted again today that it comes down to a question of staff. Much of what is proposed in this Bill is aimed at reducing the workload of An Bord Pleanála. I hope it will also lead to the system being streamlined to enable the staff at An Bord Pleanála to meet these new conditions. I can also tell the House that there has been a radical improvement during the past year and a half in terms of the amount of time it takes An Bord Pleanála to deal with applications. Indeed, if we were to accept this amendment An Bord Pleanála would be required to make decisions within a longer time frame. At present decisions are made long before the six month period expires.</P>
      <P>I should say to Deputy Kavanagh, who raised the question of exceptional cases that sometimes agreement is reached in respect of a complex planning application between the applicant and the local authority to extend the time. That is a practical way of dealing with a very complex question in the first instance within the local authority. Following on from this, provision is made in section 2 (3) for an extension in exceptional cases &mdash; I hope they will be exceptional cases &mdash; while An Bord Pleanála will be required to say that they will make a decision within the prescribed time. This provision will apply only in the case of a minor number of applications. Given the need to make sure that the system is streamlined, efficient, fair and thorough I think we have struck the right balance and put a lot of thought into selecting that time limit, taking into account our experience during the past year and a half in relation to what is achievable within An Bord Pleanála as presently constituted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say, first of all, that I am not arguing that An Bord Pleanála should take a long time to make decisions. I am very much in favour of An Bord Pleanála making their decisions as quickly as possible. In the case of many appeals placed before An Bord Pleanála the figure of four months would be too long. These are straightforward appeals dealing with small developments and it should be possible to deal with them quite quickly. Therefore I am not making the case that An Bord Pleanála should string on and on the period of time in which they have to make a decision. Two of the points that have been raised here should be replied to, the first of which is that this is about streamlining the planning process to create the circumstances where projects could go ahead and unemployment could be resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This country is remarkable in finding some new excuse as to why employment is not being created. The latest is that there are delays at An Bord Pleanála. If we look at the facts this does not hold up. Only 7 per cent of planning decisions made by local authorities are appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Of these, 70 per cent, or the vast majority, of appeals are made by the applicant and not by third parties. Ninety per cent of the appeals made by third parties are upheld or substantially upheld. In other words, the argument that there are people banging in frivolous appeals to An Bord Pleanála&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want me to name a few of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there are a few. The question of frivolous appeals is dealt with in another section of the Bill. Where there is an appeals system one will always get frivolous appeals but the fact is that, first, the vast majority of appeals are made by the applicant and not the third parties and, second that 90 per cent of the appeals made by third parties are <Col N="2018" /> upheld so they can hardly be regarded as frivolous.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make relates to the period of four months. A number of speakers have said that this figure is fine but I do not know where that figure came from. I have a document in front of me which was produced by the Irish Planning Institute which represents the professional planners who operate the system and they are quite clear in what they have to say about the figure of four months. They say that a four month period for deciding appeals is not feasible for a number of reasons. These include the length of time that it takes to exchange documents. They also argue, for example, that the figure of four months could become three months. Sometimes a number of appeals are submitted on the same issue. If one appeal is lodged the day after the planning decision is made and the next one is not made until the month is up, the decision will be made on the first appeal. This in effect reduces the period of time to three months. Therefore, I am not the only person who has argued that the four month period is not feasible; it has also been made by the professionals themselves.</P>
      <P>I do not appear to have support for the amendment, nevertheless I should like it to be put.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> This amendment is an &ldquo;out&rdquo; clause because it is decided on the issue of four months. However, the Bill also states: &ldquo;Such other period as the Minister may prescribe, either generally or in respect of a particular class or classes of appeals or other matters.&rdquo; Therefore, the period could be less than four months. The Minister could prescribe a period of time which would be less than four months, either generally or for certain classes of applications. It is a very dangerous power to give the Minister in the context of this Bill and it should not be one of its provisions. I know Deputy Garland tabled a similar amendment and he wants the phrase &ldquo;other period of time&rdquo; replaced by &ldquo;longer period of time&rdquo;. I would be happy to support that formula and if it is not acceptable to the Minister, then, clearly, he could reduce the period of four months.</P>

I pointed out on earlier Stages that the period of four months for deciding cases was carefully selected. I am satisfied that it is appropriate for cases generally and that it strikes the right balance between the need for quicker decisions and a fair and thorough examination of issues by the board. Nevertheless, it may prove appropriate, in the light of experience, to specify a different period for specific cases. For example, as Deputy Jim Mitchell suggested on Committee Stage, a shorter target period might be considered in the case of appeals dealing with routine developments which do not raise complex planning issues. Section 2 (2) (b) contains a desirable element of flexibility and should be retained. I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment, or amendments Nos. 12 and 15 which are related. Any change in the four months period will, of course, be contemplated only in the light of adequate experience of the operation of that period.</P>

      <P>I was a little confused because amendment No. 9 was ruled out of order. However, it is related and was discussed on Committee Stage. It dealt with a similar subject matter to Deputy Gilmore's amendment which we are now discussing.

      <P>During the debate on the previous amendment we heard a very forceful argument in favour of extending the period to six months. That was not accepted and the period of four months is included in the Bill. If the amendment means that there cannot be a longer period than four months I cannot understand how, on the one hand, you can argue for a longer period and on the other suddenly agree that the period of four months is adequate. If you fail in relation to the period of six months you must surely agree that there should be an &ldquo;out&rdquo; in the case of complicated appeals which would require a longer period. There is no logic in the Deputy's argument, I did not want to say that but since he wanted to hear the views of Opposition Members I had to say it.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Garland's amendment was ruled out of order. It means that the only vehicle for dealing with this is my amendment. My problem is not with the longer period of time &mdash; which we would all like to have &mdash; it is the possibility that the Minister will introduce a shorter period of time. His reply indicated to me that he is contemplating a shorter period of time, certainly for some classes of appeals. If the Minister can give an assurance that he will not introduce a shorter period of time than four months, I will happily withdraw the amendment. It would be perfectly consistent with what Deputy <Col N="2021" /> Kavanagh said, in that it allows the Minister to extend the period of time. However, if the Minister cannot assure us that he does not intend introducing shorter periods of time for some classes of appeals, I will have to put the amendment, otherwise we are leaving the legislation open to the period of time being reduced by regulation by the Minister, without further recourse to debate in this House.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage a very strong case was made by Members of Fine Gael that a two month period should be prescribed for minor, routine cases. This legislation will be put in place and we will clearly monitor how it develops. It may well be that, in the course of time, routine minor appeal cases may well be decided in a period less than four months. The flexibility provides for dealing with cases in that way and to extend the period for more difficult cases in the light of experience. I have indicated that in cases where there has been an environmental impact assessment or major development cases, it can prove, in the light of experience, that the period of four months would create difficulties. We will see whether categories of cases will emerge which require a specified longer or shorter period. Such flexibility is clearly logical because applications vary enormously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal raises the possibility that the board might serve a series of notices indicating dates by which they intend to determine a particular case. I do not consider that such a move would be satisfactory. The board would have to determine all but the most exceptional cases within the four month period indicated in section 2 (2) and would have recourse to the power contained in section 2 (3) as infrequently as possible. If the board avail of the power contained in section 2 (3) the clear expectation is that they will determine the case in question by the date that they indicated to the parties. To provide for a succession of notices indicating different target dates would in effect give the board an open cheque in terms of time and would be completely at odds with the whole purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Deputy Howlin expressed the view on Committee Stage that being limited to one further period might tempt the board to specify a far off date by which they would determine a case. I do not accept, however, that that is a real possibility and I have every confidence that the board will act responsibly in availing of the power that section 2 (3) gives them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I touched on this matter in an earlier contribution. It will be clear that if we were to provide this kind of flexibility and give the freedom to specify several dates that would in many ways act against the whole principle enshrined in the Bill. <Col N="2023" /> I therefore ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, standing in the names of myself, Deputy Garland and Deputy Howlin, deals with the changeover from the existing system of appeals to An Bord Pleanála to the new system. It is proposed that the procedure provided by the Bill in relation to the period of time within which an appeal has to be determined be implemented six months after the date of enactment of the legislation. As we all know, it is usual for quite some time to pass after the passage of primary legislation before the Minister is in a position to make regulations. In relation to the making of regulations concerning the classes of appeal which might attract either shorter or longer periods of time than the four months laid down in the Bill, the Minister has already committed himself. Quite honestly, I do not foresee the Minister being in a position to make those regulations within a period of six months. If he does do so, he will certainly set a new record. I feel that it would be <Col N="2024" /> preferable to have a more realistic period of 12 months. There needs to be a lead in period to the changed system in order to alert the public to the change in the procedure for planning appeals, the introduction of time limits, and so on. For that reason it would be desirable to provide a longer time period before this section comes into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the lead-in time for the application of the new four-month decision-making period that will be brought in, the one thing I want to stress is the staffing implications for An Bord Pleanála. It is quite clear that the Minister is not of the view that the four-month period could apply immediately. I wonder why he feels that can be done in six months. There are very serious shortcomings in relation to the staffing of An Bord Pleanála which has proved a problem for several particularly complex appeals in the past. It is clear that it is not anticipated to provide An Bord Pleanála with additional resources following the enactment of this legislation. Therefore, the Minister expects a new regime to operate, with a statutory period for decision making, without being prepared to provide extra resources, particularly staff resources, in order that the necessary work is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage we talked specifically about the numbers of staff and so on. There was disagreement between ourselves and the Minister in relation to the exact number. However, it is clear that at present there is an inadequate number operating the existing appeals system. The Minister now intends to establish a tighter appeals system without providing a single extra body to carry out the new requirements. Such a position is intolerable. I fear that because of the imposition of a deadline upon the board decisions might not be as well researched as they should be. Unless resources are put in place the quality of decisions may well suffer. For that reason we have sought to allow a 12-month lead in period for implementation. It is hoped that within that period we will be able to persuade the Minister to resource An <Col N="2025" /> Bord Pleanála adequately. It would be a reasonable expectation for the board to have that length of time in order to address themselves to the requirements of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept these arguments and allow the measure to be implemented in an orderly way so that the quality of decisions and the proper adjudication of all information that might be submitted, even the restricted information that will be available to An Bord Pleanála under these regulations and this legislation, can be maintained.</P>

      <P>When we discussed this on Committee Stage Deputy Gilmore emphasised very trenchantly that there was a staffing problem in An Bord Pleanála. I tried then &mdash; unsuccessfully as it turns out &mdash; because Deputy Howlin has gone back on that old track to convince him otherwise. But I appreciate that at least Deputy Gilmore took account of what I said on that occasion, in that clearly there has been an improvement in the position but that matters relating to staffing are subject to review depending on circumstances prevailing. I have absolutely no evidence to suggest other than that the board are in a position to discharge their duties very comprehensively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore did throw down a challenge to me. He said he did not think it would be possible to have the regulations which would be necessary in the context of this Bill in place for its enactment. I am delighted to tell Deputy Gilmore that I will break all records; I will not be waiting six months after the passage of the Bill, that it will be a matter of some weeks only. That should meet his argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then I must revert to Deputy Howlin. I think the Deputy is approaching the <Col N="2026" /> transitional period on the basis that all of this has happened in isolation from the discussion on this Bill at national level, its discussion within An Bord Pleanála, bearing in mind that in recent years a number of efforts were made internally, without the necessity for the legislative process, to ascertain what could be done to improve and streamline the system. Many great improvements were implemented, following on which bottlenecks began to emerge. These were discussed thoroughly and advice taken from people who work within the system daily. Therefore, everybody is aware that this Bill will be enacted, that it constitutes a streamlining of the system and is not hitting An Bord Pleanála without fair notice. I am satisfied that the timescale is adequate. Indeed if one takes into account the fact that since this Bill first appeared in this House almost six months have elapsed, it will be seen that we do not get work done here as expeditiously as we might like. Even within that context there has been a further opportunity afforded to streamline and develop the system in anticipation of the legislative changes widely publicised.</P>

I do not think it is a case of the public being aware of what is taking place here with regard to their planning laws. It would be appropriate to allow for a longer period than six months, if for no other reason than to allow the writers of feature articles catch up with what is actually taking place in this House.</P>

      <Col N="2028" /> In page 5, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) Where An Bord Pleanála cause an inspector's report to be produced in relation to an application for planning permission, such report shall be published and copies shall be made available at the offices of the local authority in whose functional area the site which is the subject of the application is situated.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are now reaching the stage at which the planning permission process, except in exceptional cases, will be reduced to four months. From experience I believe that the public facility of receiving information on what takes place within the duration of an appeal should be improved and any documentation in relation to an appeal should be made available. I have had the unique experience of having been refused information in regard to the names and addresses of objectors in the case of specific objections. I believe that all relevant information in relation to an appeal, and in relation to reports undertaken by An Bord Pleanála, should be made available publicly for examination, if necessary allowing a response on the part of interested parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a reasonably long discussion on this matter on Committee Stage. I reconsidered it to ascertain whether I could be more helpful in this regard. First and foremost it is important to realise that An Bord Pleanála are responsible for decisions and must take account of all of the planning considerations. The inspector's report is one component only of that exercise. The board need not necessarily agree to the inspector's report; they have a wider remit. Finally, in regard to the report itself &mdash; even if it were to be made available &mdash; the amendment seeks to have it made available after decisions have been taken, at which time it cannot have a bearing on the outcome. I really cannot see there is anything to be gained from travelling down that road. Indeed I would <Col N="2029" /> foresee specific difficulties arising in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if the inspector's report were to be published. I understand there is the general belief &mdash; which may well have emanated from the system in the United Kingdom &mdash; that the inspector actually takes the decision, except in exceptional cases where the Secretary of State would do so. There may be the public view that decisions taken by An <Col N="2030" /> Bord Pleanála are and have to be absolutely in accordance with the inspector's report, but the remit is a wider one. While I am quite sure that the inspector's report in the great majority of cases forms the basis of the decision, it may not in all cases, and, as I have said already, what is sought in the amendment could arise subsequent to decisions already taken.</P>

      <P>The reason this amendment has been put down is that too often in the past legislation and regulations have not been implemented.

We have our doubts that the resources will be available within An Bord Pleanála to conform with the four month deadline.

We do not want to see opt out clauses implemented due to a lack of resources or a shortage of staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept paragraph (b) of the amendment which states: &ldquo;The Minister is required to ensure that the Board has sufficient staff and ancillary resources to meet, save in exceptional circumstances, the time limits set out in this section.&rdquo; I think everybody would <Col N="2033" /> agree that, even in times of great financial stringency, as is the case at present due to a succession of extremely improvident Governments, bodies such as An Bord Pleanála, who are not seen as glamour boys or as very high profile or important bodies, tend to be starved of staff and resources. Getting back to the question of time limits, I and the Green Party do not wish that appeals be dragged out interminably. The issue has to be grasped; sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. In any event, the time comes when a decision has to be made.</P>
      <P>What concerns me &mdash; similar problems arose with the Environmental Protection Agency &mdash; is that if this amendment is accepted it could be very dangerous. I have no problem with paragraph (b) but I have a great problem with paragraph (a). If it is accepted some future Government could decide to run down An Bord Pleanála and deliberately starve them of staff at the behest, perhaps, of the chemical lobby or some other vested interest group who are not as concerned as they should be about the environment. If this amendment is accepted there is no way that the board could operate with an extension of the time limit. For those reasons I do not support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Garland, I have no difficulty with the second part of the amendment. It is an excellent proposal which provides that the Minister would be required to ensure that An Bord Pleanála would have sufficient staff and resources to meet the time limits agreed by the House earlier today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about having a situation whereby no extension of time could be given by the board or by the Minister in cases where there is a shortage of staff. Deputy Garland indicated one situation which could arise in the case of a shortage of staff, where a Government through their recruitment policy decide to have a further ban on the recruitment of staff into certain public bodies, and as a result there is a gradual reduction in the number of staff in, for instance, An Bord Pleanála. We now <Col N="2034" /> have a four month time limit within which appeals have to be decided. What would happen if there was a strike within An Bord Pleanála within that four months? Given the way in which industrial relations are going that is something which cannot be entirely discounted. If there was an industrial dispute in An Bord Pleanála and critical sections of staff were on strike, does that mean that the chairman or the members of the board would be required to make the decision within four months irrespective of whether they had the professional staff and the secretarial staff to provide the back-up? Deputy Allen would want to explain that because if that were to arise and if there was not some provision to allow for an extension of time in those circumstances, it would make a nonsense of the whole thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory provision governing An Bord Pleanála staffing is section 10 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976. It is a standard form to make provision for the staffing of a body such as the board. I cannot accept that any special provisions along the lines suggested by the Deputies would be the way forward. In practical terms, any application for additional staffing by An Bord Pleanála has always been considered sympathetically and having regard to resources available. At the moment we provide about £1.5 million which covers about 80 per cent of their total costs. That is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to ensuring that they have the resources of personnel and ancillary services required to discharge their duties. I cannot think of any other legislation which has a provision on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore touched on the question of industrial relations. It would be a new departure in this House if each time we made decision with regard to streamlining a system, we also made a decision along with that to provide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also possible to improve quality. The Deputy is as familiar with as many of these areas as I and he knows that is true. What we are talking about is how we apply management systems and use the resources we have more intelligently. Much of what is involved here, it must be admitted, reduces the workload of An Bord Pleanála. Up to now it was possible for a person to submit a full appeal at any stage after his first lodgment of the appeal, and in many cases the board were obliged under existing law to communicate with the appellant and seek the final submission from him. That is an additional workload which we are now taking away. We are obliging the appellant to deal with that in a different way. Having said that, clearly any changes bring new obligations and stresses. We should not just say that additional resources are required. Is there evidence on my desk that there are serious problems with regard to dealing with the new system which necessitates additional staff? I will look at that in the light of experience. I have the same interest as Deputies in making sure that this system works. As the responsible Minister, I have an even greater interest. On that basis, I would ask Deputy Allen to withdraw the amendment and to be satisfied that the resources available to An Bord Pleanála are adequate. If that turns out not to be the position we will give them a sympathetic hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the comments by Deputy Garland, I know it is often said that policies will be dictated to a Minister by chemical companies or some other companies, but this is a democratic House and everyone has the right to speak. In most cases, regardless of which parties form the Government, Ministers have not drifted too far from the realities of life and from being fair. I would like <Col N="2036" /> the Deputy to accord the same attribute to me and my successors. It is not a question of satisfying any particular interest. It is a question of putting in place a fair balanced system which takes account of special needs and gets good decisions. There will be decisions refusing applications. It is important that these cases, too, are streamlined because often a person who wants to pursue a development will invest in some other project if the application is refused fairly readily. The faster a decision is taken on one application the more quickly a person can move on to look at another option. It seems to be inherent in some of the contributions that it is always a question of letting something through. We are talking about a system that is fair. If a system is fair, not everything that goes before it will be considered proper and these will be refused in the normal way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything the Minister said I am not reassured on the staffing requirements of An Bord Pleanála. Not only am I fearful in relation to the new requirements that this legislation will impose on An Bord Pleanála but I am concerned that they have no adequate staff to deal properly with the appeals currently before them. There have been inordinate delays in one or two cases. I am concerned that if we put a legal imperative in place, that a decision must be made within a certain time, the quality of a decision must inevitably suffer. We can have an efficient process, if our definition of efficiency means that the decision will be made on the date prescribed, but that is not the definition of efficiency that I would accept. There must be a proper decision. Proper planning and the environmental impact assessment must be taken into account. I am not convinced that that can be done with the staff complement currently employed. I would like the Minister to look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fearful in relation to the future. I am reassured somewhat by the Minister's commitment to personally interest himself in the operation of this Act. I do not for a minute question the bona fides of <Col N="2037" /> the Minister in this regard. However, with a very crowded agenda and a very cluttered desk, with new issues arriving daily, it is understandable that when legislation is enacted it might simply go out of sight and out of mind. I hope the Minister will make sure that not only are the decisions made in the timeform set out, but that the quality of the decision is also maintained for the better development of our country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the whole area of staffing, one issue of great concern to me with which I am familiar is the level of staffing available to the initial planning decision makers, the planning authorities in each county. It is quite clear that inadequate staffing levels currently exist in many planning authorities where the initial decisions are made. I hope the Minister will be mindful of this when speaking about adequate staffing for the appeals mechanism. Adequate staffing and adequate technical expertise should be available to the initial decision-makers at planning authority level. There would be fewer appeals if adequate resources were available in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I have a certain difficulty in relation to the amendment. I fully accept the thrust of its second part, but I am somewhat jaundiced in my approach to the initial part. There could be situations where the requirements of this subsection would be impossible. I hope the Minister will bear in mind the points made on this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed this Bill in Committee some people on this side of the House said four months was not adequate. The Minister said that the Department arrived at an average. He did not know exactly whether this four months would work or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>We felt that four months was too generous and that An Bord Pleanála were being given soft terms of reference. That is still the case. People are still concerned about delays in An <Col N="2038" /> Bord Pleanála. Complaints of this kind are often made to public representatives. Since four months is specified, we are seeking to copperfasten this provision. Inordinate delays have an adverse effect on the prospects of job creation. Investors need to know. Our amendment requires greater efficiency and seeks to prevent the excuse that delays arise because of staff shortages. The Minister should have given stronger assurances about the matter. In accepting the period of four months, he knew he was not setting an impossible task for An Bord Pleanála and that there was some room for manoeuvre. The Minister should be setting higher targets. He indicated that he would be keeping an eye on the board. He will be reminded every day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify one or two points. Deputy Garland in a throw away remark implied that Ministers, former Ministers and spokespersons are in the pocket of the chemical industry. Any proposal we put forward as a party is put forward because we believe it is right for the country. A few of us were talking about environmental issues before Deputy Garland discovered them as political issues. The discussions I have had with the chemical industry indicates that their worst fears are about legislation, conditions and standards. The major problem is not what we are imposing on them but what we are not saying. They are afraid because of the lack of regulations and policy, especially in the area of waste. They want us to get our act together as legislators so that they will know where they stand. I know a number of industrialists who did not invest here because of the uncertainty. The Minister is concerned about this also. Anything that defines a regulation in a firmer way is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fear has been expressed that in the <Col N="2039" /> event of a strike the Fine Gael amendment would be hard to apply. If we were to cease considering proposals and amendments because of the fear of strikes, we would get nowhere. I hope that industrial development will not be held up because of strikes within a Government agency and that there are inbuilt mechanisms within that agency to make decisions that would allow job creating developments to go ahead. It should not be the case that everything is held up by a strike which lasts for five or six months. That sort of thing is the ruination of the country, regardless of the rights or wrongs of the disputes. We would be prepared to drop the first part of the amendment if the Minister would show some goodwill to our proposals and accept the second part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made my position quite clear. We have debated issues like this before. I have indicated already the specific legislation that governs these matters. I have assured the House that I will be monitoring developments arising from the passage of this Bill to see whether in the light of experience something further is required. I have also told the House that in many ways the specific provisions of this Bill reduce existing staff loads as well as creating new ones. It would be very unfair to commit ourselves to unknown quantities in the light of not having any experience of the operation of the Bill and of its effect on the board. Deputies will have to accept my assurance that I will take account of these matters in the light of experience. To ask me to take that on as an obligation would be unfair and unreasonable. It has <Col N="2040" /> not happened in the past in relation to regulations of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the meeting on 28 February 1992, which I and relevent Ministers had with the Central Review Committee and on which I reported to the House in reply to a question from Deputy De Rossa on 10 March, the committee met on two occasions &mdash; 25 March and 28 April. The committee normally meet on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>The end-April live register figures which were published on 1 May have not been discussed by the Central Review Committee. The committee are scheduled to meet again on 3 June. Any public statement on the deliberations of the committee is a matter for the committee themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the committee considered that additional problems are being created by the growing cycle of unemployment feeding on itself? First, a huge chunk of the unemployed population are unemployable by virtue of the fact that they have no skills and unemployment is so endemic in the family that nobody can remember a member of the previous generation being employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> Second, there is the frightening prospect that unemployment is growing at such a rate that we are fast approaching a time when the taxpayer will not be able to foot the bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly appreciate the points the Deputy is making, particularly in relation to the long term unemployed. A recent labour force survey shows that 50 per cent of the male unemployed have only primary school education and, as the Deputy rightly points out, the long term unemployed lack skills. Particular attention is being directed at the area of training schemes and we have introduced training and employment subsidy schemes. There is a growing interest in the employment subsidy scheme in respect of which approximately 6,000 companies have sought application forms. This gives some idea of the interest building up in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that there is no instant solution to the escalating unemployment problem and I am sure he will also agree that there is no single initiative which can stop that increase and that it will take a combination of initiatives and policies, which the Government are working on at present, to stem this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What approach is taken at meetings of the Central Review Committee? Do the committee members evaluate the individual elements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i> The Taoiseach alluded to the apprenticeship scheme. Any independent body evaluating the apprenticeship scheme at present must acknowledge that it is in a total shambles because people cannot get apprenticeships. People who are sick, lame or blind have to wait for treatment because of the long waiting lists. The experience in the food and tourism industries, areas of huge potential growth, is nothing other than a tale of lost opportunities, Do the committee evaluate the success or failure of each individual sector?</P>

      <P>While the proceedings <Col N="2042" /> of the committee are confidential to the committee themselves, although they publish reports from time to time, I can assure the Deputy that a special task force on tourism has been set up to seek out every opportunity in this sector. The Deputy should hear about the recommendations the committee make from time to time. The same applies in other areas as well. I will not go into detail on the proceedings of each meeting but the Deputy can be assured that the focus of the committee is on seeking out every possible opportunity for creating jobs.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that approximately 5,000 young people leave school every year without a qualification of any kind and join those who have limited prospects of employment? What are the Government doing about this? Is the Taoiseach aware that a number of schemes for the unemployed require that a person be unemployed for a minimum of a year in order to qualify for assistance and the effect of having to remain unemployed for a year is frequently more damaging than the benefit derived from participating in a scheme for which he might subsequently qualify?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the Deputy, recognise that problems exist and every possible initiative that can be taken will be taken. I recently announced an initiative in Tallaght where we established a pilot scheme setting up 12 areas based companies to operate in very severe unemployment black spots around the country. This is a test scheme to see if we can get people off the unemployment register and back into employment.</P>
      <P>There is an established correlation between educational achievement and unployment. Consequently we are looking at ways and means of rectifying low educational attainments through adult education to other areas linked to education so that we can improve the lot of the group referred to by the Deputy.</P>

In the case of Bord Fáilte it used to be the policy &mdash; I understand it may well still be the policy &mdash; that staff should be rotated. Whether that policy is implemented as rigorously as I or the Deputy might wish is another matter and that is what I am anxious to find out from the State bodies.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister in favour of the staff being allocated to different countries on a five year contract? Will the Minister ensure, on the basis of the commitment and effort by these staff, and the increase in the number of tourists from the countries in which these staff work, that their annual budget is increased by a percentage equal to the percentage increase in tourists? This would give the staff the incentive to work harder. They should receive a reward in real terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure it would be necessary to give them a financial reward. Rotating staff, such as is done by the IDA on a regular basis and is being done consistently by the Department of Foreign Affairs in embassies and consulates abroad every four or five years, is enough of an incentive for any employee of a State company to go out there and work very hard. The first year would be spent in getting to know the market; the second year would be used to push out the boundaries that existed before the staff member took up <Col N="2045" /> duty and the next two years would be used to improve on that effort. For anybody it is good, if possible, to have a change every four or five years. It would be very good for the morale of staff located at headquarters if they knew that at some stage they would get an opportunity to go abroad to a different market, return to headquarters, renew themselves and then, perhaps, go to a different market abroad.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Government decide towards the end of each year the budget requirements of each Department and that includes semi-State bodies under the aegis of those Departments. It is a matter for the semi-State companies to decide how they will divide that allocation each year. Despite severe economic recessionary times since 1987 Bord Fáilte have done reasonably well. I accept, as I am sure all Members do, that they could never have enough to do all the work we would like them to do abroad but they are certainly getting their fair share.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 3 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>On 25 February, I gave the House details and progress to that date of Ireland's application for EC funding for mobile assets. On 5 March, discussions were held with the EC Commission to discuss the reasons for their refusal of Ireland's application. On 24 April, a further submission was made to the EC Commission for funding for access transport services. This application addressed the concerns expressed by the Commission at the March meeting. The Commission have indicated that they will respond to this application shortly.</P>
      <P>In 1990, KPMG Stokes Kennedy Crowley on behalf of the Irish Government and the EC Commission examined Ireland's requirement for improved sea and air freight services. Based on their recommendations, the Government applied to the EC Commission for initial priority investment in direct shipping services to mainland Europe which were regarded as essential by the consultants. Investment in air freight services, while regarded as desirable by the consultants, was not accorded the same priority as investments of a future application for aid for air freight services if the EC Commission accept the principle of EC funding for access transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> In conclusion, I would like to place on record the Government's appreciation of the co-operation and support we have received for our application from the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the farming organisations, Irish MEPs from all parties and the Irish members of ECOSOC.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware I am referring to Dr. Tony Ryan's speech at the IMI conference and the Aer Lingus proposal in relation to an air bridge which would provide a direct link for air freight from Shannon to Luxembourg. I appreciate what the Minister said about the EC Commission but have the Government analysed this proposal in terms of cost and the benefits to be derived therefrom? In view of the fact that rail freight on the continent will provide three hour access for freight between one point and another is it not vital that we have, for high value goods, such a facility in place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since the last time I was involved in Question Time the Government have been pushing very strongly for EC assistance for mobile assets. We have to fight that case, we lost it once and we have gone back to the Commission who are prepared to look at it again and present their results to us shortly. It is essential that we convince the Commission of the importance for this country, which will be the only island country in the European Community after the Channel tunnel opens, of EC support for such mobile assets. Up to now, we have made our case on the basis of shipping assets. The idea of an air bridge is not new; it was mentioned a number of times previously. In my Department we are awaiting the proposal Dr. Tony Ryan made in Killarney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Minister did not answer my question. I am aware the request for shipping aid was refused. My question was whether the Minister will apply for air freight aid? While Dr. <Col N="2048" /> Tony Ryan may not have made a specific proposal my understanding is that Aer Lingus have. Under it they propose using 737 style aircraft which would require an annual subsidy in the order of £100 million. Is it the Government's intention &mdash; whatever about the EC Commission &mdash; to apply for an air bridge to transport products, especially fresh food, to the continent where the time factor is critical? Is the Government's policy to consider this proposal and pursue it as Aer Lingus have outlined?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured the Government are pursuing every avenue to try to reduce costs to Irish industry to enable it provide more jobs. We must be aware of what the competition directorate of the EC said publicly in regard to EC subsidies for mobile assets. They are very concerned that any subsidy given to any member state in relation to either air bridge or shipping freight facilities would be against the competition policy of the European Community. They are the issues we dealt with in the new request we put to the Commission and which my officials and the Commission officials have been dealing with in the past number of weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>In the course of my recent meeting with the Independent Radio and Television Commission I suggested that it would be useful in the context of my review of broadcasting, to which I have referred in the House in response to previous questions, to have the commission's thinking regarding the future direction that broadcasting policy might take.</P>

      <P>Are the Independent Radio and Television Commission qualified to make recommendations to the Minister in view of the fact that there is a possible vested interest? It has been suggested in the past that it could be the disburser of licence fees and that there is a possible vested interest in relation to the future of a third television channel. Also, there has been a long-running saga in that connection, including a court case, and there may be bias in relation to the Independent Radio and Television Commission that the Minister ought to bear in mind. In view of the urgency of decisions in relation to this matter, has the Minister given a timescale to the Independent Radio and Television Commission for making the case to her?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of my review of broadcasting, I have been meeting all the different groups involved in broadcasting. In that context I would think that the Independent Radio and Television Commission would have a viewpoint that they would like to put across and would also suggest that all of the different groups I have met have a vested interest in their own particular area of responsibility or interest. That should not rule out presenting proposals to me. It is on that basis that I asked the Independent Radio and Television Commission, following a recent meeting with them, to put their proposals to me, in the same way as I will be asking RTE, <Col N="2050" /> the national station, when I meet them in a couple of weeks' time to do the same thing.</P>
      <P>I have indicated to all of the groups I will be meeting that I want to have these discussions finished and their proposals before me very shortly, that is, within a matter of weeks. I am anxious that my review of broadcasting and whatever amendments I might propose would be brought to Government fairly quickly and that when we come back in the autumn it would be possible for me to have amending legislation here for discussion in the House.</P>

Does the Minister recognise the urgency, particularly in relation to the loss of revenue from advertising, the loss of jobs and the indecision in all sectors of the advertising media and all sectors of the media industry? I assume the Minister is aware that RTE is £8 million over the cap. What will happen to that money? What is the position in relation to the proposals for local radio, for national newspapers and local newspapers which are worried about their future and about lack of jobs? In particular, what is the position of small and middle sized businesses who cannot now advertise on RTE because the cost of advertising on RTE is too high for them and they are therefore going outside the State to advertise on UTV and even on Sky?

      <P>I would, and that is why I have set out on the trail of talking to all of the people who are very anxious to talk to me and make their points of view known. I accept that the capping and the difficulties in relation to minutage on RTE advertising has created massive frustration not just on the national station but with advertisers, with small and medium size enterprises who, as the Deputy rightly says, cannot afford the level of advertising charges now being asked by RTE and are bringing their business elsewhere. I am concerned about that. It would have been very simple for me to bring in a one-line Bill of amendment to the 1991 Act which would simply lift the capping and change the minutage. I thought, however, and I think the Deputy would agree, that there are more fundamental changes that need to be made in relation to broadcasting and that is why I embarked on the basis that I did. I hope that in the autumn session we will have an amendment to the 1990 Act here.</P>

      <P>The European Commission adopted its Green Paper on the development of the Single <Col N="2053" /> Market for Postal Services on 13 May 1992. The Green Paper is a discussion document, the purpose of which is to stimulate an in-depth discussion with Governments, users, operators, employees and other interests in order to shape policies to ensure that all customers throughout the Community receive efficient, high quality postal services at affordable prices. Following a consultation period, the Commission will draw up definite conclusions and propose any necessary action.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper envisages, <i>inter alia,</i> the establishment of a set of reserved, i.e. monopoly, postal services, the basing of postal tariffs and inter-administration compensation payments on costs, the separation of regulatory and operational functions, the setting of service performance standards and harmonisation of certain aspects of the postal service.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper also envisages the possible liberalisation of certain areas of the letter mail service. These aspects will need to be considered in depth, in particular regarding their potential impact on the financial viability of An Post and the need to maintain the economic and social balance necessary to guarantee the continuation of the universal service at an affordable price.</P>

The extent and quality of services are kept under continuous review by the company. I understand that Iarnród Éireann expect to take delivery of 17 new railcars during late 1993 and early 1994. These new railcars will enhance the overall quality of the company's commuter rail services In addition, the company are also inviting tenders for the provision of ten new locomotives for use on mainline rail services.

Each time a complaint has been made I have asked Iarnród Éireann to investigate it and received a response for the customer which is very important. As the Deputy will be aware, I stated in the House some weeks ago that one of my objectives in reviewing the operation of the Structural Funds was to see if we could strike a balance and what proportion of European Regional Development Fund moneys went to the railways and roads. I would prefer to see public transport being given a higher priority. If public transport is to get the investment that it needs, in particular for mainline rail services, we need support for that kind of development from the European Commission.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that while it is the responsibility of Iarnród Éireann to guarantee the safety of passengers carried in inferior rolling stock that this question should be of the utmost importance to her? Will she confirm that timber framed carriages are still <Col N="2059" /> being used on the line which runs between Limerick Junction and Limerick and that the passengers who have to use that service are in danger? Would she also confirm that the policy of borrowing carriages and locomotives from Northern Ireland Railways has been discontinued and it was the cause of some embarrassment when they requested Iarnród Éireann to return those carriages and locomotives? As an independent nation, we should provide proper trains and proper lines and stop borrowing from Northern Ireland Railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>Airlines which operate scheduled air services between Ireland and the US need the specific approval of my Department to overfly Shannon Airport. This is given only in the most exceptional circumstances, primarily for safety reasons. A separate decision is made on each application, following consultations with the relevant technical, aeronautical and meteorological services of my Department, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus applied to my Department on 25 March 1992 for permission, for operational reasons, for flight EI 133 from Dublin to Boston on that day to overfly Shannon. The departure of the flight had been delayed from 13.00 to 22.30 hours due to technical problems. As there were no safety or weather considerations involved, permission to overfly Shannon was not granted. There was no delay on the part of my Department in conveying that decision to Aer Lingus. On the following day, 26 March 1992, Aer Lingus sought permission, for a flight <Col N="2061" /> to New York and the flight to Boston held over from the previous day, to overfly Shannon Airport due to adverse weather conditions. After a thorough investigation of all the circumstances surrounding the proposed flights, the permission sought was granted, without any delay on the part of my Department. I am satisfied that the procedures currently in force within my Department in this regard operate efficiently and satisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that it is preposterous that the operatives of an airline service from Dublin to Boston or elsewhere have to ring officials in his Department &mdash; or, more particularly, have to find the Minister of Government, who has decided not to answer this question &mdash; to get permission to overfly Shannon in certain circumstances? Will the Minister of State also agree that the people best positioned to make that decision are those who fly the aeroplanes? Will the Minister of State please explain &mdash; because the Minister is afraid to answer the question &mdash; why considerations in regard to weather and safety did not arise on this occasion when the specific need was in relation to the flying hours allowed to the pilots who were waiting to take the planes? If they were to abide by the requirements of the Department they would have had to fly longer hours than is permitted. What was wrong with the very reasonable suggestion that the Boston passengers would be taken by bus from Shannon to Dublin, where they would connect with a flight travelling to Boston, thus allowing full safety considerations to be applied?</P>

      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, the Minister's approval was not needed in this case. It was a technical matter which could be dealt with by people within our Department. They did not need to have recourse to the Minister on this occasion and, therefore, there would not have been any delay. I can assure the Deputy that the Minister is not afraid to answer any question. In this case Aer Lingus were informed that exceptions to the Shannon stop-over policy are allowed only in the gravest of cases, for example, when safety is involved. In this case the problem related to mustering crews, which was a management issue, not a technical or safety problem. For those reasons we can only give permission to by-pass Shannon for technical or safety reasons, which was not the case in this instance.</P>

However, each day there is a different story in the newspapers, that there will not be any change or that officials have been out to Delta with whom they have reached a compromise involving new direct flights from Los Angeles to Dublin. There is uncertainty &mdash; indeed almost ridicule &mdash; among mid-west and aviation interests. Will the Minister tell us what is in her mind because she is damaging everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As regards newspaper reports, we cannot <Col N="2064" /> be responsible for what journalists write and I do not think any further comment is necessary.

      <P>I have been informed by the chairman of CIE that Iarnród Éireann are providing a range of commuter rail services on the Dublin-Mullingar line which serve Enfield, <Col N="2065" /> Maynooth, Leixlip, Louisa Bridge and Leixlip Confey and another five stations on the line into Dublin. There are no proposals under consideration in Iarnród Éireann to extend the range of these services. The question of re-opening the station at Kilcock is, under the Transport Acts, a matter entirely for Iarnród Éireann. The company have informed me that market research which they carried out in the area indicates that demand is insufficient to justify re-opening Kilcock station at this stage.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a strategic study into the future of the railways being carried out by CIE in consultation with my Department. In fact, a subsequent question tabled will deal specifically with that study. I have already said several times that I believe that the only way our public transport service, which includes the service referred to by the Deputy and services in the Dublin area, can be developed sufficiently is with the support of the European Commission. That is why we have been pursuing vigorously with the Commissioner the prospect of EC support being made available for the development of mainline rail and commuter services in the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>The application for EC funding and the discussions going on in relation to EC funding concerned, in the first instance, the Dublin-Belfast rail line. As the Deputy is aware, the outcome was very successful. We are now pursuing with the EC two elements, the south-west rail corridor and the light rail system for Dublin. In the context of the negotiations for further Structural Fund aid, we are also pursuing the possibility of EC funding for mainline rail. What I was saying earlier is that initially there needs to be a political decision made at home in Ireland about the way in which we should balance the infrastructural support from Europe between road development and public transport development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 10 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The post-1993 Community budgetary position is currently under negotiation at EC Council level. The outcome will, among other things, determine the total amount of structural funding available within the Community after 1993. While allocations to individual member states will not be decided for some time, the Government will, of course, be seeking to secure the highest possible level of funding for Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Government have commenced work on the next national development plan for Structural Fund purposes. The Minister for Finance has recently invited the subregional review committees and the social partners to make submissions outlining their view as to the content and strategy of this plan.</P>
      <P>I will not be finalising proposals for the future development of the tourism industry until I have had an opportunity to consider their submissions and, in the case of rural tourism, I will, of course, be liaising with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised that at this stage the Minister has not presented proposals to the European Commission in relation to an overall tourism plan for the next five, seven and ten years. How many European Council meetings have been held in Europe to deal with tourism matters since the Minister took office? Is the Minister in favour of the organisation of a commissionership for tourism post-1996 and are the Government supportive of such a proposal so as to ensure that the commissionership would have adequate funds to deal with regions such as Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is that no tourism council meetings have been held since I became Minister. The second question is primarily a matter for the commission itself. The President of the Commission allocates all of the portfolios within the Commission. As the Deputy <Col N="2068" /> is aware, the Commissioner for Tourism also has responsibility in other areas at present. I suppose that it is because there are so many portfolios and so few commissioners that, like Governments, they have to double up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply seems to indicate that the Government have not presented a tourism plan to the European Commission. If the Minister has not already done so, will she seek the integration of existing tourism services? For example, a Euro register for tourist agencies would help to develop this country by the provision of easier liaison between one country and another. Would the Minister be in favour of a Euro consumer charter of tourism rights in relation to accident and criminal attacks?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is in existence an operational programme for tourism that <Col N="2069" /> will finish its term in 1994. In the context of the Delors II package, which was agreed only on 11 February, the details of which have yet to be worked out by the Commission itself, the procedure followed previously will be followed again. First, each of the Governments in the Objective I region will prepare a national development plan. That plan is presented to Brussels, where, in turn, a Community support framework is produced. Based on the content of the Community support framework an operational programme for tourism is then prepared.</P>
      <P>In relation to the way in which the Government are operating their business at present, the Department of Finance have asked each Government Department to produce their proposals for inclusion in a national development plan. Considering that the Commission proposals have been available only since February and that the Commission regulations in that regard have not yet been received, I consider that a great deal of work has gone into the preparation of what we want included in a new national development plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister satisfied with the manner in which the disbursements of the 1989-93 Structural Fund were made in that a very high percentage of the funds was spent on large, individual projects and a very small percentage was distributed among the wider elements? In view of the urgency to develop a real rural tourism policy, having regard to the decline in agriculture and the decline in industry, and the urgent need to retain population and jobs, would the Minister agree that the presentation of a policy for the next four years provides an opportunity to create a massive development? There is a great interest in wilderness, isolation, castles, old homes, and so on, and this task should be undertaken immediately by the Minister and the Government in the interests of rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question concerning rural tourism, the finance for <Col N="2070" /> agri-tourism came from the Agricultural Directorate in Europe to the Department of Agriculture and Food and was disbursed by Bord Fáilte. The funding was so small that the uptake was immediate and therefore many good projects that could have been supported and would have been supported if further funding were available could not be supported.</P>
      <P>On the larger question concerning the distribution of the Structural Funds to date, a decision was made in 1987-88, when the operational programme for tourism was being put together, that one of the things we needed in this country now was an upgrading of the quality of the product. This is because people will no longer come to Ireland merely for the beauty of the scenery or the hospitality of the people and now go for activity holidays on a much greater scale than before. Therefore, we needed to invest the Structural Funds support we were receiving from Europe into providing that kind of quality product. That was the basis on which we provided many all-weather facilities right across the country divided into each of the regions. Now we have an opportunity, in the preparation of the new operational programme for tourism, to examine that, ascertain how it worked, what response we received and ascertain whether we need to change it in any way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether the stop-go policy obtaining in the tourism sector in so far as grants for the development of projects are concerned &mdash; in respect of which she accepts there are no funds &mdash; is demoralising to those people endeavouring to attract tourists here?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> There was an operational programme for tourism and X amount of money available for investment in tourism. Applications were submitted which were judged by Bord Fáilte, who were the people appointed by the European Commission and the Government to arbitrate on these issues. The funds have been disbursed accordingly. I explained a moment ago, and will not repeat, the basis on which that was done, in order to upgrade the quality of product available here. Of course there were not sufficient funds. Indeed had we had more funds we would have been able to assist further projects. That is why we are hoping that with the increased funding that will become available by way of the new tranche of Structural Funds under the Delors II package, we will be able to assist some projects that had been submitted but had not been implemented because they did not receive support and indeed encourage others as well.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from the consultant's report on the Dublin-Belfast line, which was commissioned by my Department, the Northern Ireland Authorities and the European Commission, the Irish and British Governments announced approval for the upgrading of the line at the recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
      <P>The project will involve investment of IR£73 million and will be completed within five years. It is expected that preparatory work in connection with the project will commence shortly. The total cost of the works on the southern side of the Border amounts to over IR£42 million. The European Community will fund 75 per cent of the cost of the work on the southern side with the balance being financed by Iarnród Éireann from their own resources.</P>
      <P>The project involves the upgrading of track and signalling and the provision of new rolling stock to enhance the quality of services on the line. The line will be upgraded to permit speeds of 145 kilometres per hour &mdash; 90 mph &mdash; which will reduce the journey time between Dublin and Belfast by up to 20 minutes. When the project is completed it is envisaged that eight trains per day in each direction will be operated on the line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the decision to effect this line improvement along with a comparable improvement in the quality of the rolling stock and locomotives since we had been demanding such improvement for a very long time. Given the incredible sum of money to be injected into this project &mdash; £73 million &mdash; in addition to the existing value of the line and infrastructure, will the Minister say what steps she will take to protect the security of the line which has been closed on such a regular basis by <Col N="2074" /> IRA activities? I contend she must address this problem if that line is to remain permanently open in the future. Would she say what future steps she might take, along with her parliamentary colleagues, to ensure that this vital infrastructure is retained for the betterment of passengers from Northern Ireland and the Republic?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us would share the distress the Deputy has outlined in relation to the many times the railway line from Dublin to Belfast has had to be closed. This is an issue which has been raised consistently at the Anglo-Irish Conference by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice and which will continue to be monitored on that basis. Indeed that is the proper forum within which both authorities, north and south of the Border, should continue to co-operate to ensure that such incidents are at least minimalised and, hopefully, arrested altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that five years would seem to be a very long period within which to have this work carried out? Would she consider having that timescale shortened at all so that this project would become a reality must faster? Would she say what proportion of the £42 million &mdash; that is the Republic's share &mdash; is being borne by the EC and what proportion by our Exchequer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in welcoming this development. I say that as somebody who lives virtually on that railway line. Would the Minister avail of this opportunity to state clearly that IRA activities, particularly north of my constituency, will not be allowed to influence in any way any decision in relation to <Col N="2075" /> this development, that there will be no backing away from it on that account? Will the Minister say whether the service will be improved since there are at present substantial, continuous complaints being made about the service, particularly that from Drogheda to Dublin with regard to timekeeping, the locomotives breaking down and so on?</P>

      <P>The decision on the part of both Governments indicates that they will not be influenced in any way by the activities of paramilitaries from one side or other of the community. The Deputy will appreciate that the total investment of £73 million is an indication of the type of work that will be undertaken on the line to render it of the standard we would expect from that type of line.</P>

      <P>While An Post may not require the Minister's observations the Minister certainly makes her observations and support of management very public. Would the Minister agree that the policy of An Post management is one of clear conflict and confrontation; that, for example, the decision of management to refuse to pay wages to working staff was, to say the least, provocative, which when coupled with the two rounds of massed suspensions and the decision of An Post management to unilaterally implement the recommendations of the special tribunal established under the Labour Relations Commission, without concluding negotiations with the Communications Workers' Union, indicate quite clearly that the management of An Post are determined to destroy the trade union movement representing male and female employees of which there are approximately 6,000? Furthermore, would the Minister not agree that her position, in supporting management, has been an unacceptable slap in the face to industrial relations here? I would appeal to the Minister finally to stay off-side in this dispute, perhaps allowing the likes of Deputy Callely &mdash; who can bring children back to school &mdash; handle delicate issues like these because I believe she is merely adding fuel to the flames?</P>

      <P>I said from the beginning of this dispute that I am on the side of the national interest and the taxpayer. The Government have made it <Col N="2077" /> clear to An Post management that they will not be prepared to provide a subsidy for An Post to become viable and break even in 1992. The Government asked the Labour Relations Commission to bring together both sides in the dispute to discuss their difficulties. We set up a tribunal and recommendations were made by them and the Labour Relations Commission. These recommendations were accepted by the management of An Post but were not accepted by the trade union.</P>
      <P>I have no wish to be painted as being in a hardline corner in relation to a dispute in any organisation which comes under the aegis of my Department, but one must be realistic. I spoke earlier about the implications of the Green Paper on postal services published by the commission. I am as anxious as anyone in this House to see this dispute resolved and to see both sides sitting down together not just talking but negotiating. We have had 41 meetings with both sides but unfortunately very little has been achieved. The Labour Relations Commission machinery is available and will remain available and every encouragement is being given to both sides to go to the Labour Relations Commission. That is the only way in which this dispute can be resolved. I believe in dealing with the realities and the reality in this case is that An Post are losing money. If this trend is not corrected at this stage An Post will not be in existence by the beginning of 1995.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a common perception &mdash; it is certainly the perception on this side of the House as a result of what she said here &mdash; that she is on one side in this dispute? That is a bad thing for her to do. Does she agree that the Government bear considerable responsibility for the present dispute given that 16 months ago the An Post viability plan outlined the position in the company? The Minister's predecessor described the position in An Post as a crisis which required immediate attention. However, the Government have done nothing to resolve those problems since then. This dispute is a direct <Col N="2078" /> result of inaction by the Government during that time. This has led to a deterioration in An Post&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These representatives were on their best behaviour, as we all tend to be when we are on television. If she listend to what they said, would she not agree that the actual difference between both sides is quite small and that if a real effort was made to bring these people together and an unbiased person kept at the table this dispute could be settled and much unnecessary hardship avoided?</P>

      <P>As I said initially, I am on the side of the national interest and the taxpayer. That is the side I have to be on: as Minister I have no choice in this. I have spoken separately to the Communications Workers' Union and the Communications Managers' Union over the past ten days. I have outlined my views in relation to the dispute to both unions, where I stand and where I think the future lies in terms of this dispute. I believe the resolution of this dispute lies very firmly in the offer of the Labour Relations Commission being taken up. As the Deputy is aware, the dispute was moved forward this week when the Labour Relations Commission sought an elaboration of the tribunal's recommendations. It is perceived that there is a difference between the way management view the tribunal's proposals and the way the trade union view them. It is important for both sides to sit down at the table together once that elaboration has been got. At the end of the day it is not I, Deputy Currie or anyone in this House who will resolve the dispute; it can only be resolved by both sides sitting down together. I agree with the Deputy that if the kind of cordial relations which were displayed on the <Col N="2079" /> national airwaves last night were displayed at the negotiating table there would be a great possibility of progress being made.</P>

Therefore, it is not true to say they are introducing a new and different practice in Dublin which has not been in operation already. As I said before &mdash; I cannot reiterate this point often enough &mdash; the solution to this dispute lies at the negotiating table of the Labour Relations Commission. I again appeal to both sides, as I have done on every public occasion afforded to me, to sit down at that table and to negotiate a resolution to the dispute.

Has the <Col N="2080" /> Minister, on behalf of the Government and in pursuit of the aims and objectives set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, made representations to An Post about the increased use and reliance on casual employment as means of job creation? Would she not agree that it would be more in keeping with the aims set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> if the management of An Post were asked to have more regard to the creation of permanent rather than part-time and poorly paid jobs?</P>

That question asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of yesterday's comments by Judge Murphy, a Circuit Court judge in Cork, about the free legal aid dispute and the recent serious incidents in Cork where criminals who would normally be in prison are roaming the streets of Cork because of the breakdown of the criminal courts system, he will make a statement on the matter. Subsequent to the dreadful events that occurred in the Cork District Court this morning I put down the following question: To ask the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement in view of the decision made today in the Cork District Court to strike out a murder charge because of the absence of free legal aid to the accused arising from the free legal aid dispute.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the action of a judge in Cork District Court today who struckout a criminal charge in the case of a person charged with the crime of murder. The action by the judge was taken in the context of the legal aid dispute involving solicitors in Cork city as a result of which legal representation would not be available to the defendant in any further proceedings arising from this charge. I can assure the House, however, that the State may still prosecute the defendant in respect of the charge against him.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the solicitors' action in Cork in refusing to operate the criminal legal aid scheme, persons charged with criminal offences before the courts in Cork city who are granted free legal aid cannot get a solicitor to defend them. This is notwithstanding the Minister's frequent appeals to the solicitors to resume this vital work pending the outcome of the negotiations between the Department of Justice and the Incorporated Law Society on that body's claim for a complete review of the fees paid under the scheme. The society's claim was lodged with the Department of Justice on 18 February last, more than four months after commencement of the action by the solicitors in Cork. In their claim the society sought an enormous increase, in the order of 500 per cent, in legal aid fees for solicitors in all parts of the State who operate the criminal legal aid scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting on Friday, 1 May 1992 to discuss the society's claim the Department made an offer of a significant increase in fees payable to solicitors in respect of criminal legal aid work done by them in the District Court and in respect of appeals to the Circuit Court. They also offered to introduce a mechanism which would ensure that these fees would be reviewed on a regular basis. The Department did not make any offer on that portion of the society's claim <Col N="2085" /> which related to fees paid to solicitors for criminal legal aid work done by them in the Circuit and higher courts. By virtue of the statutory arrangements whereby increases in legal aid fees granted to counsel for work done in these courts are automatically extended to include solicitors, the solicitors have already had full benefit from the significant increase granted to barristers in 1991 for criminal legal aid work.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the significant offer made by the Department on Friday, 1 May which would apply to solicitors throughout the State was rejected by the representatives of the Incorporated Law Society. A further meeting with the society is due to take place this week. I can assure the House that every effort is being made to process the claim and to resolve the dispute as speedily as possible. I take this opportunity to appeal to the solicitors in Cork to resume operation of the criminal legal aid scheme pending the outcome of negotiations with the Incorporated Law Society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that a Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht is answering a very important question involving the welfare and safety of the people in Cork. Does the Minister realise the seriousness of the position in Cork city where hardened criminals who are normally behind bars are roaming the streets at present? The gardaí in Cork are demoralised because they know who the criminals are but cannot get a conviction in the courts in Cork. I ask the Minister to behave in a responsible manner &mdash; the Department are guilty of criminal negligence in this case &mdash; and I also ask the solicitors in Cork to behave responsibly in this episode. The people of Cork are the victims of an ongoing dispute. I ask the Minister to come forward with the real figures. He mentioned 500 per cent which sounds impressive, but I would ask the Minister to confirm that the bill for the free legal aid scheme last year was £60,000. To give a figure of 500 per cent is just leading us <Col N="2086" /> on. I ask the Minister, and the Department of Justice, to involve themselves immediately in realistic negotiations, to put an end to the sparring and to think of the people throughout the city who are the victims of negligence.</P>

The Minister, or the Department, must negotiate at national and not at local level. The case made by the Incorporated Law Society was not received by the Minister or the Department until 18 February this year. The Department responded four months after the Cork solicitors decided they would strike and sent the ultimatum to the Minister. This must be negotiated nationally. Is the Minister to ignore the Incorporated Law Society who have responsibility for negotiating on behalf of solicitors throughout the country? They met on 1 May and the figure of 500 per cent is the base figure. In fact, it is much higher.</P>

I once more call on the solicitors to return to operating this <Col N="2088" /> scheme pending the outcome of the negotiations.

Is it true that that document was submitted to his Department after years of frustration and long-fingering by the Department who refused on many occasions to come to realistic negotiations with the Southern Law Society on what are considered by everybody to be the rather meagre fees being paid under the free legal aid system? The Minister says he will not negotiate across the floor of this House but will the Minister ask the Minister for Justice, or his Minister of State, to enter negotiations with the Southern Law Society and the Department? The Minister should become politically active in order to stop what happened today in Cork where, after 22 adjournments of a case, the person charged was released.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 19 is in the name of Deputy Gilmore. Amendment No. 20 is related. It is suggested, therefore, that for discussion purposes we take amendments Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 1 and 2, to delete &ldquo;, at any time before the expiration of the appropriate period,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two amendments have to do with the manner in which appeals are submitted to An Bord Pleanála. Under the Bill as proposed it is intended that appeals to An Bord Pleanála be submitted within one month of the making of the planning decision by the local authority and the submission would have to state in full the grounds of the appeal and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which they are based. This amendment seeks to separate the making of the appeal and the statement of the grounds. In other words, there would be two stages in making the appeal. In the first stage the appellant would submit a notice of appeal within one month. Subsequent to that a further two weeks would be allowed for the submission of the statement of the grounds of the appeal. There is a misprint in amendment No. 20 in that the word &ldquo;months&rdquo; should read &ldquo;weeks&rdquo;. The intention is that the appeal <Col N="2117" /> should be notified within one month and that a further period of two weeks should be allowed within which the statement of the grounds of the appeal should be submitted.</P>
    <P>As I stated in relation to earlier amendments, sometimes the period between finding out that a planning authority have made a decision and being able to submit an appeal is very short. It may take two or three weeks before the decision of the local authority is known to an individual or to a residents' association. By the time they call a meeting to discuss it the limit of one month may have been reached. It is a very short timescale within which to prepare a case for appeal, particularly if a complex issue is involved. It might be necessary to make complex arguments in relation to traffic movements or sanitary services and it might be necessary to get some professional opinion. I am seeking to allow a further period of time within which the appellant can make a full statement. I do not think it would unnecessarily delay the whole procedure. First, there would be the notification of the appeal and then the statement of the grounds of the appeal. It could be submitted simultaneously but a further two weeks would be allowed.</P>
    <P>We did not reach these amendments on Committee Stage. It is pushing it a bit far to send in full details of an appeal within one month, particularly as the opportunity to make a further statement is excluded. Only if one is asked for additional information, or if one is replying, can one submit such information. The proposed extension would not delay the appeals procedure but it would allow a little more flexibility and latitude in making the comprehensive statement required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support these amendments because they dovetail well together. We on this side of the House have expressed our disquiet about the narrowing of the procedures open to third parties in appealing a decision to An Bord Pleanála. One of the things that causes great disquiet is that a full <Col N="2118" /> statement of objection, outlining all the matters to be covered, has to be submitted within the four week timeframe. I think it is a very good idea to separate the notice of appeal from the detailed statement. This suggestion is worthy of the Minister's consideration. I suggest that we adopt the mechanism where the formal appeal must be lodged within the four week timeframe but that a further two weeks will be allowed to complete the process. I was a little disquieted when I read six months but a six weeks period seems eminently reasonable as it gives an extra two weeks to deal with matters that might require a co-ordinated approach. For example, it would allow a residents' association to make a composite submission taking account of everybody's views as it may take longer to prepare this submission than that of an individual. It also may take longer than four weeks to submit a professional opinion.</P>
      <P>On Second and Committee Stages a great many Members commented on the lack of time to prepare a comprehensive once-off statement. One gets only a single bite at the cherry under this Bill and it is therefore important for any appellant to make a comprehensive submission. For that reason it is eminently sensible to ask for an additional two weeks to give time for this to happen. I do not think this change would lengthen in any way the appeals process but it would give a slight breather to groups. Much of the four weeks could be eaten up before people would become aware of the planning decision, and the <i>de facto</i> position is that people have less than four weeks in which to prepare their case. I suggest that the notice of appeal should be lodged within four weeks but that an additional two weeks, which is not exactly extravagant, should be allowed for the submission of a comprehensive case. If anything this is too short a timeframe to work in but it is certainly preferable to the timeframe required by the legislation as put before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments tabled by Deputy Gilmore and supported by Deputies Howlin and Garland involve a fairly fundamental departure from the Bill's proposed requirements for the lodging of an appeal. Instead of having to submit the full grounds of appeal within the appeal period, the appellant would only have to send notice of appeal within the period and then submit the full grounds within a further two weeks at the end of that period. In effect what the Deputies are advocating is a halfway house between the Bill's proposal and the present position, where appellants have only to submit notice within the appeal period and the board must then pursue them for submission of the full grounds of appeal.</P>
      <P>I do not believe an arrangement such as that suggested by the Deputy is either necessary or desirable. The requirement in the Bill to submit the full grounds of appeal within the appeal period is reasonable and will not prevent appellants from making comprehensive submissions to the board, especially since the appeal period for third parties will be increased from the present three week period to a period of one month.</P>
      <P>The obligation was on all appellants to submit notice of appeal and the complete grounds of appeal within 21 days, but that changed following the court case and the change in the regulations, but up until then that had been the position. I have increased the time limit from three weeks to one month, and the same start-up day will apply to everybody. I have also assured the House that in the regulations to be introduced the transparency of the procedures and the question of public notice will be dealt with in such a way as to enhance the possibilities for very early notice so that the appeals can be prepared and submitted in due time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already agreed on the timeframe of four months but if this amendment were accepted we would be putting further pressure on An Bord Pleanála to meet the prescribed time limit. Four <Col N="2120" /> weeks is a reasonable period and indeed it is a week longer than most people had to submit an appeal until recent years. It is also a way of ensuring that we improve the system, at the same time taking account of the needs outlined by the Deputies. If we take the three areas together, increasing the time limit by one week, the transparency of public notices, as prescribed by regulation, and the evening up of the start-up time for everybody, Deputies will note I have gone a fair distance to meet their suggestions on Committee Stage. I, therefore, ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment and I do not intend to withdraw it. Normally I would seek to call a division on an amendment of this kind but having regard to the amount of time available for the remainder of the Report Stage I will simply be asking the Chair to put the amendment as I will not be calling a division on it.</P>
      <P>However, before I do that I want to respond to some of the points the Minister made. I am very disappointed that he has not made some concessions on this particular amendment. I do not think we can make a valid comparison with the present position whereby the appellant has three weeks to submit a notice of appeal and the situation as proposed in this Bill. Under the present arrangements the appellant may submit his case piece-meal over a period of time. It is possible for people to keep submitting additional information in relation to an appeal for quite some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure proposed in the Bill will affect both the applicant and those who wish to lodge objections to the planning application. The local authority set out the reasons, some of which may be very technical, for their decision. Some of the grounds for refusing planning permission, or granting permission subject to conditions, may relate to possible traffic hazards, the absence of sanitary services or drainage and a whole range of other reasons. Whether the applicant or somebody opposed to the decision wishes to lodge an appeal, he would need some <Col N="2121" /> professional assistance to make his case, particularly if he wished to refer to a technical point. Quite honestly, I do not think it is possible to do that within the timescale allowed for in this Bill; as we have already said, we are not talking about a case where the appellant will have a full month to prepare his case. The month runs from the date the local authority make the decision and the appellant will not have a full month. Even with the postal service at its best it will take a couple of days before the notice gets to the applicant and it may take an even longer period of time in local authorities where the planning lists are prepared weekly for the information to reach the appellant, and it may be up to two weeks before a residents' association, or a community organisation, for example, find out that a particular decision has been made. That is in situations where local groups are well organised. There may be other cases where it may be right up to the expiry date before people find out the decision has been made. They have then got to go to the planning office to check the file, they have got to see the reasons for the refusal, they may well have to consult with other people about it, they may have to get some professional assistance and on top of that they have to put the case together for submission to An Bord Pleanála. They are under enormous pressure in that they get only one chance and if something is omitted in the submission to An Bord Pleanála they cannot re-enter it at a later stage. Even in cases where an oral hearing has been granted people are specifically excluded &mdash; we will come to this later in the debate &mdash; from entering new material at that stage. The only opportunity that somebody making an appeal to An Bord Pleanála has to state their case is before the month's deadline. That is cutting it much too fine. I had hoped, and I thought it was reasonable, to allow a period of two weeks during which time the board would be aware an appeal was coming in. Presumably in the earlier stages, when an appeal comes in, all that is done is purely administrative work and inspectors are assigned to that file. All those matters <Col N="2122" /> can be dealt with within the period of two weeks before the full statement goes to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. I will be asking you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to put the issue to the House. I would also ask the Minister, in anticipation of the outcome, to consider this matter further before this Bill is debated in the Seanad. This is the section that will cause the biggest problem in future years. Following the enactment of this Bill, public representatives, will continually have problems with people coming to us and saying: &ldquo;I did not get the full submission into An Bord Pleanála and they will not now consider it, we did not have time to prepare our case&rdquo; and so on. This will be a disaster area, and since the Minister does not appear to be disposed to deal with it here &mdash; in the Seanad, legislators will have to come back to it at a later stage to iron out the difficulties because it will create all kinds of problems and may well lead to legal challenges where people feel they have not been given ample opportunity to state their case.</P>

We had a fairly lengthy discussion on this matter on Committee Stage and Deputies were somewhat concerned that the appeal period of one month would run from a slightly different date in the case of the applicant for planning permission. I have reflected on the matter in the meantime and I have come to the conclusion that it would be preferable in terms of consistency and clarity if the appeal period ran from the same date for all persons. Accordingly, amendment No. 21 proposes to replace the existing provision in the Bill with a new provision under which the appeal period of one month will run for the applicant and everybody else from the date of the planning authority's decision.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 23 and 25 from Deputies Mitchell and Howlin, respectively, would amend the definition of the appeal period only in so far as it relates to persons other than the applicant for planning permission. I consider, however, that it is preferable to amend the definition so that the appeal period will be identical for all and on that basis I could not agree to those amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 22 and 24 from Deputy Gilmore would create a situation in which the appeal period for all persons, including the applicant, would run from the time the planning authority publishes notice of their decision. While this <Col N="2124" /> approach has the advantage of bringing about a uniform appeal period I consider it would be preferable for the appeal period to commence for all on the day of the planning authority's decision as proposed in my own amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed the Minister has not gone that one step further in this case. I welcome his own amendment so far as it goes in that it now gives everybody a month rather than the present unsatisfactory situation of 21 days in one case and a month in another. The legislation, with the Minister's amendment, refers to the making of a decision by the local authority. Simply because a decision is made by the local authority does not mean that the people who could be affected by that decision know about it. In fact, they may not know about it for a considerable length of time after the decision is made. I want to amend the section further so that the month, which the Minister now proposes in all cases, would run not from the date of the giving of the decision but the date of publication of the decision. That would put an onus on local authorities to ensure that publication of the decision follows rapidly, if not simultaneously, with the giving of a decision.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the present postal dispute we all know that between the time a decision is made, a letter is typed, signed, posted and delivered there can be a lapse of a significant period perhaps as much as ten or 12 days. Sometimes letters are incorrectly addressed and returned to the sender after a couple of weeks but admittedly they are exceptional cases. My experience is that when I have made inquiries in respect of any planning decision I usually receive a letter about that decision more than a fortnight after the decision is made and frequently close to the deadline for lodging an appeal. That is even when we have a normal postal delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned by Deputy Gilmore and others in discussion on earlier amendments if the decision was made close to an August bank holiday weekend or the Easter weekend or if it coincided with <Col N="2125" /> the holiday period of one of the people involved they might find on their return from holidays a letter in their postbox informing them they had a month in which to appeal when the date has already elapsed. It may also be the case that people who have not been directly involved in the initial planning application but who would be affected by the decision do not know about it. That is why the Minister should accept that not only should planning applications be published weekly in the same place in the same newspaper but also planning decisions. In this case we are asking that they be published and that the month run from the date of publication.</P>
    <P>The major weakness in the Minister's argument is his absolute refusal to take steps to inform those members of the public who might reasonably be regarded as being affected by planning permissions. He has refused to insert in the legislation a provision that there should be weekly newspaper advertising of all planning decisions, applications and appeals. The Minister seems to be resisting the idea that the month in which appeals may be lodged should date from the publication of the decision and not the date of the decision. The Minister would be doing himself, the public and the planning process a great service if he reconsidered his attitude to this question of publication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue addressed in the Minister's amendment was raised on Committee Stage. What exactly is a month? In the Bill, as drafted, there was one definition of a month for the applicant and another for everybody else. In the case of the planning applicant a month dated from the time the letter with the decision of the planning authority arrived through his letter box. In the case of everybody else the month dated from the time the decision was made by the planning authority. I am pleased that the Minister has seen fit to equalise the situation so that the definition of a month is the same for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Mitchell's reservation that, in effect, the period available is less <Col N="2126" /> than a month because the month starts to clock away once the decision is made by the planning authority but notification of the planning authority's decision may not reach the interested parties until some time later. However, at least we do not have one definition of a month for the applicant and another for everybody else and, to that extent, I welcome the Minister's positive response to what was said here on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for his comments. The fact is that we do listen to good arguments and there is no question but that they were trenchantly made on the last occasion. I am happy to go as far as I can to ensure a level playing field.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Mitchell's point, it would not be fair to expect us to legislate for all contingencies. It has always been the practice to stick rigidly to the date of the giving of the planning permission. That is enshrined in all of the planning laws since 1963. Our position has been consistent and is well recognised. For instance, somebody who has made application to the local authority for planning permission will be aware that there is a two months statutory limit for the people making submissions and the people making submissions would also be aware of that. One would assume from some of the contributions that the process only starts when there is an appeal. The startup position is at the earlier time when application is made to the local authority which, itself, is fairly specific notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point about the obligation of the local authority to ensure that decisions are made known to everybody connected with the application in the shortest possible time. I have assured the House, in the context of the review of the planning regulations and the public notices and the transparency that will be required, that I will make sure that is adhered to evenly and consistently throughout the country. It has been brought to my notice that some local authorities are excellent in giving notice to interested parties but it may well be that there are delays in other places. I <Col N="2127" /> want to make sure that these are eradicated and that we will have a uniform policy that is effective and transparent and fair to everybody.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1) The Board shall be answerable directly to the Oireachtas or to a designated Joint Committee thereof, not in relation to any specific appeal decision but in respect of its general policy, efficiency and fairness.</P>
      <P>(2) Where such function has been delegated by both Houses of the Oireachtas to a Joint Committee the terms of reference of that Committee shall include detailed provisions of how the Committee and the Board shall relate to each other.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on Second Stage, and again on Committee Stage, I am very concerned that the entire planning process should be democratically accountable. Where councillors seek to intervene in planning decisions by means of section 4, they should be restricted in that process in that it now requires not only a three quarters majority of those present but a three quarters majority of the entire council to do this. I was gratified by the results of the county council elections in Dublin County last year to find that those who misused section 4 so extensively were generally treated very harshly by the electorate and were, in the end, answerable to the electorate for their behaviour in planning matters. In the present situation, while the local authority can be overruled by means of section 4, at least the manager of the local authority himself can be held to account <Col N="2128" /> by the elected authority. In any event a decision of the manager can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that An Bord Pleanála are answerable to nobody. It is right that individual decisions of An Bord Pleanála should be matters of independent judgment and that is something that cannot be superseded by a Minister, by a committee or anything else. However, as regards the general policy of the board, efficiency of operation and general standards within the board, the board should be answerable in some way to this democratically elected House. I have tabled this amendment to provide that there would be an environment committee of the House to which the board would be generally accountable. I am not certain, quite honestly, that that is the most effective way of making the board democratically accountable but it is at least a way to have the matter discussed here in the House. Every organ of this State should be accountable to the public. As things stand the board are virtually in the same position as the courts and, like the courts, the board depend for their staffing arrangements and resources generally on the Department. Criticisms levelled at the board might indeed be properly levelled at the Department or the Department of Finance. If such criticisms were made, that would come up at an environmental committee.</P>
    <P>I would be very interested to hear the Minister's views on the question of democratic accountability in relation to An Bord Pleanála. I should emphasise, however, that I am not referring here to any individual decision or arguing that any individual decision should be overturned. An Bord Pleanála should be the final arbiter in these matters unless of course there is an appeal on a point of law to the courts but it should be rather on their general performance and attitude; for instance, their attitude in granting planning permission in breach of the development plan of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I am very unhappy that whereas three quarters of the members of the local authority have to agree before the local authority can supersede their own <Col N="2129" /> development plan, An Bord Pleanála can grant planning permission and thus supersede the development plan without being held accountable to anyone. I would like the board to be answerable and to outline what their attitude is in respect of those matters. Would they not agree, if they feel it is right to grant planning permission in breach of the accepted development plan of the county, that before doing so they should consult with the local authority or that at the very least there should be an onus on them to argue or prove their case? We, in this House, decided that councils can only make this decision where three quarters of the members agree because we wanted to allay any fears of public scandal. Yet, the board can make this decision without being held accountable to anyone.</P>
    <P>There have been long delays within An Bord Pleanála and I would like to give the board an opportunity to account for these either now or in the future. It may well be the case that it is not the board who are responsible for these delays but rather the Department and the Department of Finance, given the lack of resources, but then again perhaps they were due to inefficiency within the board. I wish to find some way of making the board democratically accountable. If the Minister is not prepared to accept my amendment perhaps he would suggest some other ways of doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very good amendment from Deputy Mitchell. I agree with him when he says there is a need to make bodies like An Bord Pleanála accountable. A trend has developed whereby people seek the establishment of independent institutions to make decisions on a range of matters. It is correct that there should be independent institutions to deal with individual planning applications professionally outside the realm of politics so that people will not be pressurised in making individual decisions, but underlying the call for the establishment of independent bodies is a latent distrust of politicians on the part of the public. <Col N="2130" /> We need to re-examine that matter because while we are getting independent bodies they in turn are not accountable to the public or to this House except perhaps to the Minister who appoints them as members of those bodies.</P>
      <P>If the public do not trust their politicians they should change them. This House should be the vehicle through which bodies are made accountable for their policies and general approach. I agree that the time has come to establish an environment committee of this House and there is much work that it could do. An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency, when established, could be made accountable to that committee. In addition, they could address the regulations and secondary legislation that the Minister now has to deal with almost on a daily basis and which is not examined either in this House or by any committee of the House.</P>
      <P>There is a necessity to establish a committee similar to the Committee of Public Accounts to address these matters. This point is particularly relevant to An Bord Pleanála. Since I became a Member of this House serious allegations have been made about the conduct of that body, while concern has been expressed publicly about some of the decisions that they have made. I can recall two specific cases which led to substantial awards of planning compensation because the reasons given by An Bord Pleanála in refusing planning permission were compensatable, whereas the reasons given by the planning authority were non-compensatable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious questions were asked by the public, including myself, as to how An Bord Pleanála could make the same mistake twice and how they could, in handing down a decision, give reasons which were compensatable. In the SJX case &mdash; the Roches Hill case &mdash; in Killiney in my own constituency the sum involved was of the order of £250,000, while in the Mountgorry case in Swords Dublin County Council had to pay compensation in the order of £2 million. The same mistake was made twice. In each case An Bord Pleanála's decision left the local <Col N="2131" /> authority open to a claim for compensation by giving reasons, in refusing planning permission, which were compensatable whereas the local authority gave reasons which were non-compensatable. To date An Bord Pleanála have not explained how this happened.</P>
    <P>Second, there have been serious allegations of corruption in the planning system in the Dublin area which ultimately led to charges being laid and a court case being held which involved the chief planning officer of An Bord Pleanála. I do not want to deal with that court case, as the court dealt with that matter, but the Minister for the Environment, in particular his predecessors, and the Minister for Justice, were questioned in this House during the past few years by myself and others. They were asked whether an inquiry would be established into the planning system in Dublin but no answer was ever given. I still do not know whether the Garda investigation which led to charges being brought against the chief planning officer of An Bord Pleanála has yet been concluded. Newspaper reports at the time led us to believe that the issues under investigation were considerably more widespread than the issue on which the charge was subsequently based.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has an opportunity to clarify the position, to inform us if the Garda investigation is ongoing, whether he expects any further charges to be brought and whether he intends to carry out any investigation or inquiry of his own into it. Many recent cases have given rise to requests for the establishment of inquiries. In some cases these have been established. I submit that there would be no need to hold inquiries or for Members of the House to call for the establishment of inquiries if public bodies were accountable to the Members of this House, if Members were permitted to ask questions at a committee about, for example, the conduct of An Bord Pleanála and if everybody concerned in these bodies was aware that there was a <Col N="2132" /> formal system of examination of the work of these bodies.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about involvement in individual decisions because it would be quite wrong if individual planning applications became the subject of political debate in a local authority or in a committee of this House. However, the overall conduct of their affairs by An Bord Pleanála &mdash; or other bodies &mdash; needs to be subjected to a greater degree of public scrutiny than is the case at present. We have firm grounds for concern, to put it at its mildest, about the conduct of An Bord Pleanála over the past number of years. We need a vehicle whereby the Members of this House can examine the situation and obviate the kind of speculation and reportage which has given rise to public concern and to demands in this House for the establishment of an inquiry into the planning system, including An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>I warmly support the amendment tabled by Deputy Mitchell and I am pleased that it has been supported by Deputy Gilmore. As those Deputies said, the concept of an environmental committee is very useful and I hope it will not take as long to establish as the foreign affairs committee which was promised so often in this House but which has not, to my knowledge, been set up.</P>
      <P>If an environment committee is set up I hope provision will be made to have a representative of the Green Party on it as we tend to be excluded from all these committees. Deputy Gilmore has stolen my thunder as he spoke before I did; I suppose, representing a party of six, he is entitled to speak before I do. Unfortunately, he said everything I intended to say and I am sure he said it much better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tara mast was an extraordinary case and it is an example of the need for some type of audit of the decisions of An Bord Pleanála. It involved an oral hearing and the inspector duly reported to An Bord Pleanála who refused the appeal by local residents. It turned out afterwards that the board went against the decision of the inspector and it was a fluke that that fact emerged because normally the public do not have access to that type of information. We have dealt with that matter already but questions asked were not answered satisfactorily by the Minister when we debated it earlier.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept this amendment because, from time to time, the public have been very concerned about totally inexplicable decisions made by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should take note of the points made by Deputies and ensure that there is greater accountability. I have seen at first hand the deep concern of my constituents in relation to some of the decisions taken by An Bord Pleanála and Deputy Gilmore referred to some of them. These decisions have cost &mdash; and will cost &mdash; millions of pounds of taxpayers' money. The Grange Developments site at Swords was one and there was another development in Donabate, which, between them, cost approximately £2.5 million because An Bord Pleanála left the issue of compensation open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment deals with general policy, efficiency and fairness. I am a little concerned about the &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; aspect; I do not have any difficulty in regard to the general policy or what is required by the board to make them a more efficient organisation but the public are concerned about politicians being involved in the decision-making process. I know that politicians are involved in decisions regarding section 4 or the material contravention process but the general public must have confidence in the process. Unlike the situation in the UK, in this country the manager of the planning department makes his decision <Col N="2134" /> and then it goes to An Bord Pleanála. If an Oireachtas committee was set up the public might be afraid that its members might become involved in a particular decision. I would not like that to happen because I know that some politicians try to make an impact on particular decisions. In the past they were involved to a greater degree in planning decisions which were not in the long term interests of proper planning and development of our communities. While there is a need for greater accountability, the general public must be assured that politicians will not become involved in querying decisions. We are trying to build up the confidence of the public in the planning process because, for too long, there was a perception that if you wanted a decision you went to your local politician, particularly if he was a county councillor, and that he would look after you. The independent process was set up to get away from that system by An Bord Pleanála. Unfortunately, public confidence in An Bord Pleanála has been eroded by ridiculous decisions made by them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a general consensus in the House in regard to an environmental committee. I would not have any objection if I thought we would make progress as a result of establishing such a committee. However, if I had any advice to give to Deputies it would be that the committee should not be established as a result of a debate on An Bord Pleanála or planning matters. It should, of course, arise in a broader context and perhaps the Whips will have an opportunity to get together and talk about it. As I said, my advice is that it should not emerge from a debate like this which would tend to create an impression that an all-party Dáil committee saw special new functions for themselves in relation to planning matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell, and others, were in the political arena at the time of the decision to move to the establishment of an independent statutory body to deal with planning appeals. As Minister for the Environment, I am happy that the old regime has long since gone. I was a <Col N="2135" /> Deputy when a Minister for Local Government was involved in adjudicating on planning appeals throughout the country. Nobody is suggesting that those days should return. It was very important to establish the independence of the planning processes firmly, legally and constitutionally and that was done in 1976. There is the opportunity for court proceedings when it is felt that the actions of An Bord Pleanála do not live up to the board's constitutional requirements or adhere to natural justice. In view of the independent character and the quasi-judicial nature of An Bord Pleanála, it would be very difficult to develop a regime under which the board would be directly answerable to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputies made very trenchant points in relation to general accountability and accountability to the democratic system. I share those aspirations. On many occasions politicians feel frustrated because independent authorities of one kind or another do not appear to be answerable to the social needs and requirements of their area. The board have to be separated from the main body of authorities as they deal with sensitive matters of planning and have a quasi-judicial role and authority. I would find it extremely difficult to try to develop proposals for a regime under which they would be answerable to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell stated that An Bord Pleanála should not be answerable on individual cases and expressed a fear that in certain instances the board might depart from the principles of development plans. As the Deputy knows, local authorities have the same powers. He has rightly said that in his council a two-thirds majority is required&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a three-quarters majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A three-quarters majority is required by that council, and that is good. However, An Bord Pleanála were not established in the same way as local authorities and do not consist of elected representatives but of individuals who <Col N="2136" /> have special expertise that can be put to use in special applications.</P>
      <P>However, one or two developments that occurred in the past few years raised eyebrows. Shortly after I was appointed Minister for the Environment I asked the Secretary of my Department to issue a report indicating the steps open to me to improve the system. I do not consider that the answer lies in the establishment of a system whereby An Bord Pleanála would be accountable to Dáil Éireann but it is clear that account has to be taken of the experience gained since 1976.</P>
      <P>In a very general way, I am happy to say that the vast majority of decisions taken by the board were made on the basis of a fair and thorough examination of the different applications and I do not consider that the public should have any great worry in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore questioned decisions by An Bord Pleanála that gave reasons for refusals which did not rule out the payment of planning compensation. It is a matter for the board to determine what reasons for refusal should be cited in any case. They cannot manufacture reasons merely to preclude payment of compensation and the reasons have to relate realistically to the development in question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned the 1985 case heard recently in the Supreme Court. The reasons for refusal of permission given by the board were non-compensatable in that case.</P>
      <P>There is a fair body of evidence since 1976 to maintain confidence in the independence of the system. I doubt very much whether Deputies are wise in going down the road of trying to bring the independent planning process into the arena of accountability so far as this democratic institution is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the argument that the House has responsibility over many other issues and the workload of the House could be made unmanageable. I take the point that Deputies are not asking to have individual cases discussed but I do not know how such measures could be dealt with without becoming involved in individual cases. Many of us would prefer <Col N="2137" /> that different decisions were taken from time to time by the courts, for example, but if our courts system was not independent and the House had some right of interference an examination of such a system five or six years after establishment might well prove that many decisions taken would be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>With all the scars and all the problems of the present regime, when one is talking about matters that are not clear cut in relation to planning appeals there will always be two sides to a story. Inevitably, there will be at least two groups or individuals with a different view, each with rights. Somebody has to take a decision one way or the other and that means, ultimately, that there will always be aggrieved parties. There is no simple way out of that. Some may think that the Dáil can, in some transparent way, colour that for the public. I do not consider that to be right. I recall the days of the old system and while I am not saying that this system is perfect, it is better.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the light of one or two developments in recent years, I wish to determine the range of options open to me to improve the system. I am anxious to hear Deputies' comments on how that might be achieved. However, I doubt whether adherence to the prescription enshrined in this amendment would do anything to improve it. It is important that we and the public have confidence in that system. That does not mean one will satisfy everybody, that is just not possible when it comes to circumstances in which there may be two, three or more competing considerations.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála are required, under section 9 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, to submit an annual report to the Minister for the Environment who must lay copies thereof before both Houses of the Oireachtas. That is perhaps one way to have a discussion in the House on these matters. But I would be extremely reluctant &mdash; I do not know from where the overwhelming evidence would emerge that would persuade me &mdash; that I or the House should have anything close to an investigative role as far as the independent, <Col N="2138" /> quasi-judicial, statutory and constitutional rights of An Bord Pleanála are concerned, or in respect of their independent nature to take decisions on applications or appeals for planning permissions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the thinking behind this amendment I contend that its acceptance would constitute a minefield and be a most dangerous procedure to establish. The points other Members have made in relation to the delays that have occurred in reaching decisions by An Bord Pleanála are something with which, unfortunately, we must all live. This is something that causes grave concern to local authorities and the community at large. The Minister will appreciate also that they add to the unemployment crisis since, if such appeals could be dealt with more expeditiously, I am quite sure our dole queues would be substantially reduced. To render An Bord Pleanála answerable to this House or to a committee thereof &mdash; which is what is implied in this amendment &mdash; I contend would add further to those delays. For example, would a report from An Bord Pleanála be laid before both Houses before any decision was given or rather laid after a decision will have been taken? If it is to be tabled after a decision has been given it would be a useless exercise, a toothless operation, in that the House or a committee thereof would not be in a position then to amend or rescind any decision taken. Indeed if any such committee of the House had that function, it would be assuming some of the responsibility of An Bord Pleanála themselves. Of course it was our late colleague, former Deputy Jim Tully &mdash; who died this morning &mdash; who, as Minister for Local Government, established An Bord Pleanála, and he did so because of the widespread political abuse prevailing at that time in relation to planning matters. I once heard him say that one could build a house on top of another if one knew the right politician at the right time. It was because that type of practice obtained that he, in his wisdom &mdash; which should be remembered <Col N="2139" /> particularly today &mdash; did so in an endeavour to clean up what was an absolute political mess at that time. For example, if one was not well known, or a card-carrying member of a particular political party in office at any given time, one's chances of obtaining planning permission were considerably diminished. His idea was to take planning permissions out of the political arena altogether and hand them over to an independent body.</P>
      <P>As the Minister and others have said, it is difficult sometimes to understand some of their decisions. Of course, people will always disagree whenever a decision taken is not in their favour. For example, if I support a planning permission by, say, Drogheda Corporation or Louth County Council which is appealed to An Bord Pleanála and the board rescind that decision, naturally I will be against An Bord Pleánala whereas, if the position were reserved, I would be very much in favour of their decision. Therefore, it is dependent entirely on where one stands <i>vis-á-vis</i> any appeal lodged at any given time.</P>
      <P>The notion of shortening the duration within which a decision can be taken is a good one but that can be achieved only if the Minister gives An Bord Pleanála the requisite staff and facilities so to do. I understand that has been the main cause of delays. For example, in the case of local authorities it takes eight weeks for planning permission to be granted and, if they want additional information, there are another eight weeks involved. It always amazes me how decisions invariably are taken in the eighth rather than in the second, third or fourth week. If one examines the results of planning decisions inevitably one will find that for some unknown reason approximately 99 per cent are taken in the eighth week. Then if a decision cannot be reached in time further information will be sought, some of which, to say the least, is ridiculous. Certainly information sought in the eighth week could be obtained just as easily in the first week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now proposed to add another string to that process. Perhaps Deputy <Col N="2140" /> Jim Mitchell has some other reason for suggesting there should be greater accountability. I contend accountability should be to An Bord Pleanála themselves which was, after all, established as an independent body. We must remember that the Minister for Social Welfare cannot overrule decisions of his appeals officers. The same mechanism applies to other forms of administration. I do not think that the proposal to take it out of the realm of responsibility of An Bord Pleanála, or adding another leg to the process, with a post mortem taking place after a decision will have been taken will help anybody, particularly when one remembers that the other party will not be present or be able to advance their point of view to that committee nor will An Bord Pleanála. Therefore, I would have very definite reservations about this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell did not read the amendment properly because, had he done so, he would have seen that it specifically excludes the Oireachtas or any committee thereof from involving themselves in any specific appeal decision, so that there would be no question of their delaying that process in any way. It also surprised me that Deputy Bell would have reservations about parliamentary oversight and accountability. The Minister's reaction is quite incredulous. He spoke about the difficulty of rendering a quasi-judicial body answerable to this House. Is the Minister not aware of precedents? For instance, is he not aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General, a constitutional officer, is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the general discharge of his duties? Is the Minister not aware, for instance, that semi-State bodies, established to be independent in the running of their businesses are answerable to the Joint <Col N="2141" /> Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies?</P>

      <P>There are absolute comparisons and parallels. It is wrong that people in a democracy should not have ultimate control and a say over very important areas of public policy; that is what democracy is about. That is not to say they should be involved in individual decisions but certainly they should have some clout and be able to exact answers for the general discharge of powers vested in agencies appointed to act on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Deputies Gilmore and Garland spoke eloquently and raised matters about which I preferred not to speak in moving the amendment. For example, they spoke of recent public concern about the manner in which An Bord Pleanála had been operating. Indeed there was widespread public concern about the manner in which they had been operating, not confined merely to any one or two decisions but to a series of decisions and the manner in which they were taken. Who are we to say that that could never recur or that such public concern was unfounded? The problem, though, is that questions cannot be asked about those matters in this House. Therefore, people are robbed of their rightful power. I have argued in recent years, particularly since becoming spokesperson for my party on environmental matters early last year, that my key objective would be to reinstate people's power over their local environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If decisions are made in such a way that people have no influence on them or the decision-makers are not held accountable we will be robbing people of their power. When people are rendered powerless the dam, so to speak, which holds the water back will eventually burst. We would greatly improve the planning process by making the decision-makers accountable. In addition, this would have a good impact on the environment. I do not see the rightful independence of An Bord Pleanála in making <Col N="2142" /> decisions being contravened in any way by making them answerable to the elected representatives of this House and, ultimately, the people. Many bodies are answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.</P>
    <P>I said in moving my amendment that the Minister may not wish to accept it but I asked him to put forward ideas on how we can make An Bord Pleanála publicly accountable. However, he did not put forward any ideas in this respect. I do not think it is unfair to say that the Minister believes An Bord Pleanála should not be publicly accountable. If that is his view, I totally disagree with him. I can assure the House that if I ever have the honour to serve as Minister for the Environment in the Custom House I will see to it that the planning process is made more democratically accountable at all levels.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 34 to 42, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) (a) An appeal shall consist of a notice of appeal and a statement of the full grounds of the appeal.</P>
      <P>(b) The notice of appeal shall be submitted before the expiration of the appropriate period.</P>
      <P>(c) The statement of the full grounds of the appeal shall be submitted within six weeks of the date of publication of the planning authority decision.</P>
      <P>(d) A notice of appeal shall:</P>
      <P>(i) be made in writing,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> (ii) state the name and address of the appellant,</P>
    <P>(iii) state the subject matter of the appeal,</P>
    <P>(iv) be accompanied by such fee (if any) as may be payable in respect of such appeal in accordance with regulations under section 10 of the Act of 1982.</P>
    <P>(e) The statement of the full grounds of the appeal shall state in full the grounds of the appeal and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which they are based.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the making of appeals by residents associations and so on against the decisions of planning authorities. If there is a three or four week delay in the publication of a planning decision appellants may have to hastily amass the information they require for their appeal. There are very poor lines of communication between developers and private individuals who lodge planning applications and local authorities. The truth of this is borne out by the rather underhanded methods used by some people who make planning applications. For example, they may publish the notice of their intention to seek planning permission in a newspaper which is not widely read or distributed in the area in which they are seeking planning permission. The average Joe Soap is severely handicapped by a lack of information in the planning process. The entire planning process is a complete mystery to most citizens. When they want to make an application or lodge an appeal they have to learn how the process works. I know many residents groups and organisations who suddenly discover by word of mouth or accidentally that a planning application has been granted by a local authority. They are worried about the effect this will have on their communities and the disruption it will cause but they do not know how to lodge an appeal. I am sure the Minister knows of similar cases.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we allow citizens adequate time to lodge an appeal against <Col N="2144" /> a decision of a planning authority. We should afford citizens every access to the appeals process. This amendment proposes a different formula for the lodging of appeals to that proposed in the Bill. It proposes that the statement of the full grounds of the appeal shall be submitted within six weeks of the date of publication of the planning authority's decision. The obligation on citizens or associations to amass all the information relevant to their appeals within four weeks is unreasonable. This amendment proposes a two pronged system: first, a notice of appeal should be submitted before the expiration of the appropriate period and, second, a statement of the full grounds of the appeal should be submitted within six weeks of the date of publication of the planning authority's decision. This would be a substantial improvement to what the Minister is proposing in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, from practical experience, the initial information, from whatever source, may be confusing or inaccurate. If an individual or a residents' association, on hearing of the decision of the local authority or planning department, are rushed into making an appeal they could submit an incomplete or inadequate submission. Therefore, it is only fair that people are allowed up to six weeks in which to lodge an appeal. Very often there is a lengthy process of consultation involved. There may be divisions among residents, with some for and some against a project, and there may also be divisions in the consultation process with the public representatives. Therefore, six weeks would be a more acceptable duration to allow for the full contents of the appeal to be presented.</P>
    <P>I understand that on Report Stage I am allowed only one contribution and I have made my case on the grounds stated.</P>

      <P>I accept amendment No. 27 in the name of Deputy Gilmore. My amendment No. 28 seeks to delete paragraph (d) of section 4 (1) of the Bill which <Col N="2145" /> outlines one of the conditions for an appeal to be valid; it must state in full the grounds of appeal and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which they are based. This subject seems to come up every hour or so as it seems to be included in different sections of the Bill. We have had a lengthy debate on the inadequacy of the one month clause. Previous legislation provided for two different timescales: one for the appeal and one for the material to back up the appeal. The Minister has been very ungiving on Report Stage, as he was on Committee Stage. My amendment, in seeking to delete this paragraph, would give the appellant unlimited time to make submissions for the appeal but perhaps that is a little unrealistic. On balance, I would favour Deputy Gilmore's amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 29 in the names of Deputies Mitchell, Carey and Allen, this is a commendable effort to leave the door ajar. As only one contribution is allowed on Report Stage, by the time I hear what this amendment is about I will be unable to respond. It appears that while applicants are obliged to put all the information up front, there is a clause here which would allow for appellants, who in good faith provided all the information they had at the time, to introduce additional information. That is highly commendable and is very reasonable. It is an effort to bring humanity to the legislation. Strict time limits can lead to great injustices and to very bad decisions. This is a small concession for which I am sure Deputy Allen will make a very eloquent case, and I will certainly support him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 in the name of Deputy Howlin appears to be very reasonable in that it requires the relevant planning authority to provide information and technical assistance to appellants. This seems a very sensible and practical approach to try to help appellants, many of whom, as Deputy Byrne has said, are ordinary lay people, members of residents' associations and so on who are not skilled in matters of planning. It behoves planning authorities <Col N="2146" /> to be very helpful to these people. Developers and such people have their own technical staff who are well paid and they do not need assistance. This is an excellent amendment and I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment allows for flexibility in the system. I abhor the position whereby community groups and individuals find themselves at the mercy of professional outfits who, in submitting applications, know the system inside out. Community groups and individuals are at a loss to know the system, the regulations and the procedures. To give a recent example, a community group in Cork were told they would have a month to respond to an environmental impact study, but that period was much too short for the group to organise technical assistance and bring in legal experts. They did not have the resources to put a team of experts together to respond to the professional presentation. Before they could organise themselves financially the time was up. Therefore, the timescale of one month is too short.</P>
      <P>What we are trying to do here is introduce flexibility into the system. Realising that we supported the measure relating to a four month time limit, to expect individuals to make a full submission at the first attempt is expecting a little much. I support the Labour Party proposal that individuals and community groups should get as much advice and assistance as they need from the local authority who represent them. These people contribute to service charges and possibly commercial rates, and any assistance that is available should be forthcoming. I would ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 29 in particular. I do not know whether all amendments stand or fall together.</P>

      <P>Neither would the <i>Dundalk Democrat</i> be bought in great numbers in Cork. There have been occasions when planning officers have refused to accept a notice which they said was not freely circulated in the area. People deliberately advertise in papers which do not circulate widely in a particular area. In County Louth someone will advertise in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> and could say that the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> is available in Drogheda although it would only be read by a small minority.</P>
      <P>Some local authorities circulate the planning notice within a week of the application being made. Other local authorities keep the planning applications in bulk and circulate them virtually on the eighth week and there is not sufficient time for the elected representative to consult with people or advise them that an application has been submitted. Not alone do the people living in the area not know, but the elected representative may not know until the decision has almost been taken. I have had experience of a notice being sent out on the seventh or eighth week, whereas the decision had been taken days before that, or days after it. Deputy Howlin is trying to establish that there should be the widest possible knowledge of an application being made and that it should be compulsory for the applicant to advertise in a newspaper which is circulating in the area. The notice should also be posted up on the site. That could be done under the regulations. There is a great deal of merit in Deputy Howlin's amendment and I would ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I support the previous speakers and particularly amendment No. 32 in the name of Deputy Howlin. In my own constituency such able groups <Col N="2148" /> as An Taisce and Howth-Sutton 2000 Residents Groups have successfully fought such massive applications as the Baldoyle Racecourse application by End-camp and many of the contentious planning issues on the Hill of Howth. The Dublin Bay oil refinery was fought successfully by residents' groups. I worked with those groups. When they were preparing their cases they had to employ experts to help them and this cost a lot of money. They should have been able to get the advice from local authority experts. After all, developers can discuss their applications with local authority planners and architects before they are submitted. When an appeal goes to An Bord Pleanála, residents associations and other groups should not have to run raffles, draws and put on concerts and plays in order to raise money to object to something which would endanger the environment where they live or which would, as in the case of the Dublin Bay oil refinery, have ruined Dublin Bay. These people should have access to the expertise in the local authority as a right. The Minister should look carefully at this amendment. The groups I have mentioned, like those who opposed the oil refinery and Howth-Sutton 2000, are excellent groups and should have support when they are lodging objections. The Minister should try to accommodate such people in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, an appeal can validly be made by submitting an initial statement of appeal and sending the detailed grounds of appeal afterwards. This arrangement is not conducive to the effective operation of the appeals process, because the board have to exercise their power under section 17 of the 1983 Act to require submission of the grounds by the appellant and to allow time for him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement under section 4 (1) (d) of the Bill to submit the full grounds of appeal when appealing is essential for the proper operation of the streamlined appeals system proposed in the Bill. I am satisfied, nevertheless, that this requirement is also reasonable from the appellant's <Col N="2149" /> viewpoint and that it will be possible, given the appeal period specified in section 26 (5) of the 1963 Planning Act as amended by section 3 of the Bill, to make a comprehensive case to the board within the time allowed. If I agreed to Deputy Garland's amendment No. 28, it would be a recipe for delay in the process. The trust of this and other amendments being put down by Deputy Garland seems to be to delay the process. The Deputy should realise that delay does not mean better decisions. The package contained in this Bill ensures quick, but also full and effective, consideration of planning appeals. I cannot, therefore, agree to Deputy Garland's proposal to delete this provision.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that amendment No. 29 from Deputies Mitchell, Carey and Allen is necessary. Appeals generally will be based to a large extent on the documentation and information which accompanied the planning application. However, an appellant might wish to raise a particular issue relating to proper planning and development which had not been considered in the determination of the application. It is reasonable that an appellant should have this freedom. I fear that the Deputies' amendment might unintentionally cast doubt on it and I would not be prepared, for this reason, to accept the amendment. I take the point that Deputy Allen made that he was really looking for flexibility. In a strange way the amendment tightens the situation more than the Deputy realised. In this instance, not accepting the amendment is affording the Deputy the flexibility which he seeks.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 from Deputy Howlin would require a planning authority to provide appellants with information and technical assistance to facilitate their appeals. I am not sure that it would be reasonable in principle to require a planning authority to provide technical assistance to somebody who wishes to appeal to An Bord Pleanála against a decision by the authority. In any event, a requirement of this nature is not practical, because it is essential for planning authorities to devote their <Col N="2150" /> resources to ensuring that planning applications are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and to facilitating the effective operation of the appeals process by sending documents etc. to the board without delay.</P>
    <P>As for the provision of information, section 5 of the Bill will require planning authorities to make all documents relating to their decision on a planning application available for public inspection from the day of the decision. This will ensure that all relevant papers are available immediately to any person who wishes to consider appealing to the board against a planning authority's decision.</P>
    <P>Deputies are concerned that local authorities should facilitate local community groups as much as possible. I have indicated that in instances where local community groups for instance were appealing against a decision taken by the county council, it is hard to realise how the same technical officers could be of real assistance, since they have taken a totally different decision than perhaps the local community want.</P>
    <P>In the context of how local authorities operate, there should be room for more dialogue and for better understanding as to how the planning system operates. Here, we are specifically dealing with An Bord Pleanála but the wider question, and in many ways the much more important question, is that 90 per cent of applications that are processed by local authorities which are never the subject of appeal. In those cases and in others that are subject to appeal, I would like the process to be as open and as flexible as possible and I would like the technical officers to have an understanding and a concern for the attitudes and aspirations of local community groups. To take this into legislation as a requirement, in a situation where there may not be anything like the value to the group that is alleged in the proposal by Deputies, would be unwise. For that reason I could not agree to the amendment.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 27, I have already indicated in relation to amendments <Col N="2151" /> Nos. 19 and 20 that I do not consider the two stage approach of submission of notice of appeal, to be followed by the grounds of appeal, to be necessary or desirable. Accordingly, I could not agree to the consequential restructuring of section 4 (1) that amendment No. 27 proposes. We have gone into this on other amendments. There is no need to enlarge on it, beyond saying that there is a developing situation where notices of appeal are submitted to An Bord Pleanála, on whom there is a requirement to request the applicant or the appellant to submit the appeal. When we discussed this matter with An Bord Pleanála they said this was an area in which they were having considerable difficulty. The 1983 Act imposed this new requirement on foot of a court decision that the board should be required to request the applicant to submit the grounds of appeal. It is extraordinary when somebody is interested in making an appeal that the person must be requested continually to submit it. If a person is in earnest and really wants to make an appeal, four weeks are allowed for the putting together of a comprehensive case. In my usual generous mood I am able to accommodate Deputies on almost everything they look for, except the exact detail.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Bell that if Louth can play football and roam over the field as he did on this matter, they will certainly do well in the championship. The Deputy was here earlier. Perhaps Deputy Howlin will tell him that the public notice question is not relevant here but we are concerned to embody in the regulations a transparency which will guarantee the best possible arrangements for the public as a whole.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the mechanism for submitting appeals. I am a little upset that the Minister should be dismissive of the suggestion that the local authorities be required to provide technical assistance. Many already do so. Most local authorities are very supportive of and helpful to individuals, groups or residents associations who say they are concerned about a particular matter but are not quite certain of the technicalities. Quite often planners who have technical expertise help them to construct a case and answer specific questions of a technical nature. It would not be unreasonable to make that a legislative requirement. Such groups are often not in a position to hire professional help and it would be an undue burden to require them to do so. The Minister requires individuals and groups to provide a comprehensive statement of their objections within four weeks. Some element of assistance should be provided. I have included the words &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; because most planning authorities are under pressure in processing applications, at least in parts of the country where development is continuing.

We want to be a green county but there is nothing contradictory about being pro-development and pro-environment. That is the ethos I want to inculcate into this legislation. Many local authorities are delighted to assist with technical information in the preparation of appeals. Making papers available is not all that helpful to the layman. It is certainly not the type of assistance to which I am referring. There should be a private room where people can sit with planning officials and go through the planning applications which are of concern to them. That is the simple message in amendment No. 32. If the Minister reflects further on it, he will find it eminently feasible. He says that half of this is done already with regard to the provision of information. I suggest that he should take the other step and as a matter of course allow the provision of simple technical assistance to such groups. He would have the support of all sections of the House and the gratitude of community groups and of those individuals concerned with the proper development of the environment.</P>

      <P>The ordinary man and woman find the planning process a somewhat vague area. It is not fair to expect them on learning of the decision of a local authority to compile the total documentation in the case and present it to An Bord Pleanála in a four-week period. This is expecting too much. It is more <Col N="2154" /> democratic to allow the two-tier approach whereby the appellant can submit the initial appeal and then gather the documentation and the technical advice that might be needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister must surely be aware that very few residents' associations or individuals have the full range of technical knowledge or professional expertise required to lodge a comprehensive appeal. Indeed, very few people understand the planning process. People are put in an unequal position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the planning authority when they appeal the planning authority's decision to An Bord Pleanála. The Irish Planning Institute have argued along the lines of Deputy Gilmore's amendment for a two tier system as they say this would allow adequate time for submission of comprehensive grounds of appeal and would not create further delays. When the Minister replied to one of the other amendments he spoke of time being of the essence in order to get things done in an expedient way, but the Irish Planning Institute argue that our amendment would not create further delays as the board cannot process an appeal until they receive the documents from the planning authority involved. I understand there is a time lag between the time the planning authority make the decision and submit their documentation to An Bord Pleanála so we are not talking about an interruption of the procedures but creating a healthy democratic process where residents are encouraged to get involved in the planning process and not feel powerless when they learn of a decision that affects them.</P>
      <P>It is our democratic obligation to involve the public in the planning process, indeed, I agree with Deputy Howlin's view to extend the expertise and facilities of the local authorities to them.

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 2, after &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;but where the Board decides to hold an oral hearing of an appeal the grounds of appeal can be clarifies, elaborated on or added to, and an extension of time for the appeal may be agreed between the applicant and the Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will try not to repeat myself but this amendment is on similar lines to our previous amendments, which the Minister did not accept. We are attempting to democratise the planning system to a greater extent. One can imagine the procedure during an oral hearing. In the process of teasing out the arguments, additional angles, different interpretations and completely new insights can be exposed for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> The Minister takes up an extremely harsh position as section 4 (3) states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to section 9, an appellant shall not be entitled to elaborate in writing upon, or make further submissions in writing in relation to, the grounds of appeal stated in the appeal or to submit further grounds of appeal and any such elaboration, submissions or further grounds of appeal that is or are received by the Board shall not be considered by it.</P>
    <P>One can see that the Minister is trying to avoid difficulties by not allowing appellants to make various submissions in the four week period, to which we have now agreed, as documents arriving at different times could create all types of confusion, but in a sense an oral hearing provides the opportunity to submit additional information, which the Minister tried to prevent by compelling people to make their complete case in one submission. It is very likely that documentation will be produced to substantiate the oral evidence at an oral hearing. I can foresee instances where information may become available which would necessarily need to be teased out and developed after the oral hearing has taken place. I hope the Minister will be more charitable in his response to my seeking to insert an amendment whereby if the board and the applicant agree to an extension of time for the appeal, this could be allowed. I would like to think that the Minister will accept our amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Gilmore. Quite frankly there is a necessity to loosen up the procedures the Minister has put in place in this Bill, particularly when it comes to an oral hearing. The amendment would go a long way towards allowing reasonable elaboration and expansion. The section, as drafted, is much too narrow and restrictive. I would hope the Minister would look positively at this proposal, which is one of a number of amendments that seek to work towards the Minister's objective, that is the <Col N="2157" /> rationalising, in terms of time, of the planning appeals process while at the same time enabling all considerations to be taken into account so that the best decisions are made.</P>
      <P>It is not enough that we arrive at the most speedy decisions; it is also in the national interest that we arrive at the best decisions, and this amendment would help to achieve that objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very enlightening contribution from Deputy Garland. I thought he was going to say something about the amendment. In the case of an oral hearing being allowed I assume the Minister is not preventing the submission of additional information and documentation at the oral hearing. If that is the case then clearly the Minister must accept the amendment. Currently when an oral hearing is granted the appellant is allowed submit material until such time as the date for the oral hearing is fixed. When an oral hearing is taking place I hope the Minister will still allow appellants to introduce material that may not have been submitted. If you knew you would not get an oral hearing the appeal submitted would be slightly different from that which would be submitted if you were guaranteed an oral hearing. It is absolutely impossible to know on what criteria An Bord Pleanála base their <Col N="2158" /> decisions. Sometimes they will give an oral hearing for a single house and refuse an oral hearing for 100 houses; sometimes they allow it for a huge business and do not give it for a small business that may be causing a great deal more problems to individuals or to residents. It is very difficult to read into their minds why they might give an oral hearing. Can the Minister outline the procedure when an appellant is allowed an oral hearing? They receive a notification and I assume they are then allowed submit material, for example, graphs and diagrams which may be more relevant to allow an inspector see more clearly the problem on the ground with a particular application. I would like to hear the Minister's views on how he sees an oral hearing and an appellant's right in respect of such a hearing.</P>

      <P>If an oral hearing is to make any sense, clearly there must be the option for elaboration, explanation, making one's case stronger or whatever else is necessary. One cannot prescribe the ambits because it has to do with known individuals and how they have planned the whole exercise. It would make absolute nonsense of the facility of an oral hearing if I were to prescribe what a person could or could not do or say in such circumstances. For that reason the amendment is clearly unnecessary.</P>

Those of us who are members of local authorities have to deal with many problems relating to blocked sewerage systems. As a member of the 50 per cent of the population who are male, I find it slightly offensive that the dirtiest location, particularly when it is blocked, is the manhole. I do not know whether Deputy Owen wants to recommend that it should be called the womanhole or whether the Green Party have a new definition.</P>

      <P>I do not fully comprehend why the Minister said appellants have been adequately catered for in the oral hearing by being allowed submit the full documentation or to be facilitated in making their case. Deputy Gilmore's amendment seeks, because of what may come out in the oral hearing, an extension of time. It may be that the volume of information produced requires further elaboration and further research and it may be that one side has to engage the services of professional people, be they architects, engineers or whatever. The amendment seeks to relax the rigidity applied in the Bill. If there is an agreement between the board and an appellant, surely the board would be entitled to an extension of time. Would the Minister not agree that it would be incorrect, if the board believed that more time was required, that their hands should be bound? We could end up with very bad decisions if they were not allowed more time. I would ask the Minister to reconsider this call for allowing an extension of time in appeals where that is agreed between the appellant and the board.</P>

      <P>I know I am getting a little tried, but I am not so fatigued that I did not know what Deputy Howlin was about while I was replying, even though my reply came before his contribution. The simple fact is that I made the point that I did not think that it was feasible to have a legal provision to require a local authority to advise a group where it had made a decision in contravention of what the local community group might have required. I went on to say that I was extremely anxious to ensure that the planning process at local authority level would be a much more open process so that the community as a whole would have more confidence in it, be able to understand it and be afforded every facility by technical and administrative staff in so doing. This is an area in which I have a special interest and I have already made some contact with county councils throughout the country to try to support developments of that kind. However, I am not in favour of putting into legislation a requirement that technical staff be obliged to support local groups in circumstances where they clearly took an opposing view.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 33 in the names of Deputies Gilmore, Garland and Howlin. Amendments Nos. 50, 55 and 68 are related and may be discussed with amendment No. 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 3 to 8.</P>
      <P>This amendment requires the straightforward deletion of subsection (3) of section 4. As written, it is a draconian provision that will deny people the right to elaborate on submissions they have made. There is already imposed a four week timeframe within which they must make their appeal. Under this section we have required that they state in full the grounds of the appeal. In fact many groups and individuals will not have four weeks because by the time they hear of the decision it will be several weeks into the four-week period. We have decided, unfortunately that they must still have made a comprehensive case within the four-week period. The Minister decided in the previous amendment that the local authority will not be legally required to give assistance in the fulfilling of these requirements. Now, in this subsection the Minister is saying that once the submission is made the appellant shall not be entitled to elaborate in writing upon, make further submissions in writing relating to the grounds of the appeal stated in the appeal or to submit further grounds of appeal, nor shall any such elaboration or submissions of grounds of appeal received by the board be considered by them. Anything new that develops, any information of a technical nature that might come to notice subsequent to the four-week period shall not even be considered, even if it is absolutely essential to the proper determination of the appeal. This provision is quite draconian and quite wrong and I hope the Minister will agree to delete it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of related amendments. They are all deletions of similar <Col N="2163" /> subsections which repeatedly circumscribe the second opportunity an appellant currently has to make submissions. This is a fundamental right. When new and absolutely essential information comes to light it is only right and proper not alone that the individual has every right to make submissions in relation to it but that the board should be entitled to take due account of such information. I appeal to the Minister in all reasonableness to accept the deletion of this draconian subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Howlin has made the case. Similar provisions apply in sections 7, 8 and 13. It is the same point that is being made all the time and it is very important. This is clearly in breach of natural justice and, if examined more closely could mean that the Bill is unconstitutional. I would refer the Minister to Article 40.3.2º of the Constitution. There is a possibility that this draconian clause in the legislation could be held to be unconstitutional. Unless the Minister wants to make more money for the lawyers, who are getting fat enough as a result of the various tribunals, he might, even at this late stage of the day reconsider that. The last thing we want is three days in the High Court on such an issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the two previous speakers. This subsection is both unacceptable and illogical. Given that we are trying to ensure that the planning system is fair, that everything is above board and justice is seen to be done when an appeal is heard by An Bord Pleanála &mdash; I agree with Deputy Garland in that regard&mdash;it would fly in the face of natural justice if a person was not allowed to produce evidence which would have an impact on a decision. The section must be withdrawn because it is flawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make a comparison. Could the Minister imagine himself applying this provision in a court of law in a case involving a person &mdash; unfortunately, this is what is happening in the United States of America &mdash; who has been sentenced to death and is on death row on the <Col N="2164" /> evidence presented in the original court case and where additional information could not be accepted? Could the Minister envisage a situation where material evidence could be rejected and where there was no channel through which information could be conveyed?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his position as the provisions of this section are draconian. It flies in the face of the aim of the Bill which is to ensure that planning decisions are made by the appeal board only after they have considered all the available information. It is wrong that one should try to prevent access to the board in this way. The section is flawed and I cannot support any Bill which contains such a section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this amendment we need to take into account the purpose of the Bill which is to tighten up the system for everybody's sake including those who feel aggrieved about a planning decision and those seeking planning permission. For this reason we have to accept that all those with an interest in a planning application also have to tighten up their procedures.</P>
      <P>I hope this section will place an obligation on those who are concerned about a planning application. While the methods of notifying groups and residents associations that planning applications have been submitted are improving in County Dublin, the area I represent, I would like the Minister to make the placing of a sign on a site obligatory. People should be notified in two ways &mdash; an advertisement should be placed in the newspapers and a sign should be placed on the site. Many residents associations obtain the planning lists but it is disingenuous to suggest that they only have the time to lodge an appeal and submit documentation when a decision has been made because they have between two and six months, the time it takes the local authorities to make a decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is clear to anyone who has experience in dealing with planning appeals that in many cases the appellants decide to slow down the procedure by elaborating further at monthly or two-monthly intervals thus making it impossible for An Bord Pleanála to come to a decision. We are trying to streamline the system. Most people agree that this should be done but it seems each time a practical effort is made to do so an amendment is tabled to block it.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy J. Mitchell on 19 May 1992:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the problems which have now reached acute proportions in Dublin, namely&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) a crime rate treble that of the rest of the country,</P>
    <P>(2) unemployment of up to 70 per cent in certain areas,</P>
    <P>(3) the collapse of the housing programme for 8,500 families on waiting lists and many in substandard local authority flat complexes,</P>
    <P>(4) the continuing depopulation of its inner city areas with the dereliction and the huge adjustment problems this has caused,</P>
    <P>(5) traffic chaos caused by a lack of coherent transport and road policy,</P>
    <P>(6) the passive, under-used and even decaying amenities of the bay, the docks, the canals, the zoo, and the assets of our heritage,</P>
    <P>(7) the very poor level of education advancement achieved by some of its children,</P>
    <P>(8) the lack of any proper community involvement in decision making;</P>
    <P>calls for a complete overhaul of city government which would</P>
    <P>(i) establish a single Greater Dublin Authority to achieve coherent planning for the whole Dublin area,</P>
    <P>(ii) confer on that Authority new executive powers over local job creation, transport, tourism and urban renewal,</P>
    <P>(iii) confer new powers of scrutiny in relation to other Departments and Public Authorities making decisions affecting the economic and social progress of Dublin and</P>
    <P>(iv) develop a second tier of Government with devolved responsibilities which would encourage greater community participation in decision making about their area.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned last evening I was talking about the Labour Party strategy in last year's local elections. I was about to indicate that the key elements of that strategy for Dublin were the following: the provision of public services which would put the public first; inner city living; quality public transport to get Dublin on the move; conservation of the city fabric and the green belt; the cleaning up of the planning system; the tackling of the housing crisis that faces so many low-income families; and the making of Dublin a safer place in which to live. I believe that those are widely shared needs. Indeed, many of them are incorporated in the motion we are debating tonight.</P>
      <P>The first point I wish to make in relation to those needs is that it appears that the Government have already abandoned any intention to create the tier of real local government that was promised and envisaged only a year ago in the Barrington report and other documents. The revitalisation of Dublin cannot be achieved by diktat handed down from the centre, it needs real local democracy. Natural communities such as Tallaght and Clondalkin need their own district councils, a privilege enjoyed already in areas such as Bray and Sligo, which have only one-third the population of Tallaght or Clondalkin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have argued that a radical approach must be taken to empowerment in Dublin to enable every citizen of the <Col N="2172" /> metropolis to have a major input into the decisions that go into building the city of the future. Specifically, we have already called for the following. First, a democratically elected greater Dublin council to take strategic decisions on planning and transport services for Dublin as a whole. We are looking for district councils that would serve natural communities of between 50,000 and 100,000 people, which would bring local services into the heart of the local communities. We have called for the devolution of local administration to a network of local offices in neighbourhood shopping centres where people could deal under the one roof with all council and local authority services&mdash; roads, planning, parks, housing grants and so on. Those offices would become one-stop shops as it were, dealing also with social welfare, health and community information. We have promoted the use of modern communications to end the runabout that people face when having to deal with the proliferation of different public service offices, all in different locations. We say that the public have to be given a structured role in decision making through users' councils for different public services. We are asking for the streamlining of local bureaucracy and that frontline staff be given a voice in planning services. We are looking for the involvement of local communities in decisions that affect them. We seek the harnessing of municipal and community enterprise to create jobs, as was shown very effectively by the Sheffield Council and the London Enterprise Authority. We want a much stronger emphasis put on community development. Finally, we have called for resources for community groups, to include making public premises available at nominal cost; help with administration, including shared facilities; group insurance policies, to be arranged by local authorities to bring down costs, and so on. All these things constitute major improvements to local residents' and tenants' associations struggling to improve the facilities, amenities and needs of their local areas.</P>
    <P>The next realistic issue that must be <Col N="2173" /> addressed is that of getting Dublin on the move. The present balance between public transport, at 30 per cent, and private transport, at 52 per cent, into Dublin city centre must be reversed to get Dublin on the move again. To do that, Dublin must have a quality public transport system to serve the consumer well. In that connection we welcome the various commitments of Government Ministers about the possibility of significant progress towards a proper rapid transport system to serve the whole city and especially the western suburbs. Nonetheless, I hope the speeches and press releases on the subject, of which we have had plenty, will soon begin to be translated into action. If it would help I would be happy to make available to the Government the Labour Party's detailed plans for light rail transport which have already been well received by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that that, in itself, will not be sufficient. We have advanced detailed proposals already on a range of other changes necessary, such as new lines to Tallaght and Clondalkin, the reopening of the Harcourt Street line, new port access routes for lorries along the disused railway through Drumcondra, a democratic Dublin Transport Authority with power over public transport, road planning, traffic, parking for all of Dublin; consumers to be directly involved in planning and monitoring public transport services; a &ldquo;nipper&rdquo; bus network for the inner city encouraging commuters to park and ride; prepaid bus/DART tickets to permit route transfers; cycle paths along the canals and the Dodder and Tolka linear parks; the ring motorway to be completed and to be toll-free. These are only some of the ideas we have already put forward.</P>
    <P>The population of the city between the canals has halved since 1960. With over 160 acres of derelict sites in inner Dublin and pervasive urban decay time is running out. The success of Glasgow's urban renewal, achieved mainly through housing associations, gives Dublin a model for redevelopment if the Government are prepared to provide the resources for <Col N="2174" /> such an undertaking. The time has come to put a complete halt to rezoning for outward expansion of Dublin in order to focus development on the inner city.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that housing is the key to inner city renewal. Low income families in Dublin in particular know well there is a major housing crisis. There are now nearly 10,000 on official housing lists as a result of the virtual halt to public housing construction in Dublin since 1987. It is essential that a crash housing programme be initiated. In this connection, flexibility in the type of housing to be constructed must be a key feature. The practice to date of building an overwhelming majority of only three bedroomed units must be varied. For example, one and two bedroomed units and maisonettes have an important role to play; their numbers must be increased substantially. In addition, new lettings must be provided in areas where people want to live. Tenants must be given a real say in their neighbourhoods. We cannot revitalise Dublin without an active public housing programme aimed at clearing the housing lists over four years. This should include the restoration and conversion of vacant buildings, new housing and house purchase. It should also include a major expansion of the role of housing associations in the provision and refurbishment of housing and a &ldquo;homesteading&rdquo; programme to provide housing at nominal cost for individuals who renovate decayed housing to an agreed standard.</P>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency should be reinstated to fund voluntary and co-operative housing developments on sites to be made available by local authorities who already have them in their possession. In addition, community-based maintenance programmes can give a new deal to public sector tenants. There is also need for a planned programme of environmental improvements for public housing estates, especially flat complexes, with private garden space being provided for the latter as far as possible. All too often improvement projects on the part of Dublin local authorities in that regard have been held up for an unduly long period, sometimes indefinitely, in <Col N="2175" /> the Department of the Environment, another thing that has to be deplored. We contend the time has also come to consider the notion of community-based management of public housing with majority tenant involvement. That is one form of privatisation that might well contribute a lot to the task of community building.</P>
    <P>Dublin's rapid housing growth over the last 20 years has not been matched by the growth in essential community facilities. In spite of great vitality new communities face many obstacles, such as lack of resources, unemployment, isolation from extended families, isolation from local services and centres of power. If we are to address the crisis in many communities some of the essential ingredients would include the following: first, the establishment of new local councils for Tallaght, Lucan, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown with power and resources to tackle local problems in those areas; second, the IDA to target unemployment blackspots in the Dublin area; third, public resources to be targeted at areas of greatest need, for example, those identified in the CODAN report. There must be a planned programme to complete unfinished areas and provide basic community facilities. Fourth, the new local councils themselves must act as landlords for all local authority housing in their respective areas. For example, the present ridiculous position of one local authority owning and purporting to administer substantial housing stocks within the functional area of another local authority makes no sense, should be abrogated and put right as a matter of urgency. Fifth, there is no reason why there should not be a programme to bring natural gas to all areas of Dublin. Lastly, we are seeking an active youth and sports policy.</P>
    <P>Tackling crime and vandalism must be a high priority. Women must be free to walk our streets. Old people must not be prisoners in their homes which all too often, are invaded. The high cost to the community of vandalism and crime must be tackled on two fronts &mdash; through more <Col N="2176" /> effective policing, and tackling the circumstances in which crime breeds.</P>
    <P>We cannot address that problem, one of the most urgent confronting this city, without recognising certain priorities which include more gardaí on the beat, a major overhaul of Garda desk and court work. Effectively the cutbacks within the Garda Síochána have been telling increasingly as the years have rolled on. One can cut back so much but eventually one finds the results we have today, with crime rampant on the streets of Dublin, so many people being terrified, gangs running wild, no gardaí on the beat in essential areas. We public representatives hear daily that people are in fear of their lives, property and homes. That is just not acceptable.</P>
    <P>There must be a major offensive against drugs since clearly we are not making the headway that is essential there. The drug problem is worsening by the day. More resources will have to be thrown at that very serious and dangerous problem. In addition, secure units for young offenders are essential, with an active emphasis on rehabilitation. There must be effective action taken against cider parties, including the provision of attractive alternatives for young people, tackling the root causes of crime, through targeted action, thereby helping young people at risk of becoming offenders.</P>
    <P>In overall terms the key issue to be addressed is that of joblessness. The jobs crisis is at the heart of Dublin's crisis. It is at the core of the poverty in the inner city and suburbs, the increasing incidence of family and community breakdown, the outbreaks of violence and other disturbances that render parts of our city unsafe and dangerous at night.</P>
    <P>Deprivation has many faces in the Dublin of 1992 but, in the inner city communities, it wears not only the mask of unemployment, which affects young people and adults alike, it also wears the mask of educational neglect, homelessness and a complete lack of personal safety and security in many homes. What we have in our inner city communities is the mask of human want which is generations old in many cases. Poverty is <Col N="2177" /> transmitted through the vicious cycle of poor education, low self-esteem, negligible employment prospects and, finally, permanent unemployment. In most families who have experienced even one generation of stable employment and a decent regular income assets, such as a family-owned house as well as the inestimable value of a nurturing family environment are passed on to the new generation. However, for many families in the inner city, the exact opposite is the legacy which the new generations inherit.</P>
    <P>There is a simple description for what is taking place here: it is organised inequality and injustice. I say &ldquo;organised&rdquo; because the failure of the State to organise effective intervention, combined with the indifferent attitude of the market sector in most cases, amounts to a conscious choice among those who have the power to ignore what is happening here. The real crime is that those with the power could make it totally different.</P>
    <P>Unemployment stands at 20 per cent of the labour force. This is a staggering figure. It is the highest in Europe and more than twice the European average. That is a record we cannot boast of nor should we tolerate it. The unemployment rate in some communities in this city is less than 5 per cent, but in the inner city and some of our satellite suburban housing estates it stands at 50 per cent, 60 per cent and even 80 per cent and 90 per cent in some cases. The creation of unemployment ghettoes is not some tragedy of nature; it is totally manmade and is the product of greed, neglect and indifference to human dignity. The Government and the private sector, if they were of a mind to do so, have the power to make major inroads into that ill which so tragically affects many thousands of families in this city and country.</P>
    <P>The real point is that we should not analyse this problem and expect solutions to automatically arise out of understanding. We must make the political choices which make a real difference to the life options of those currently living in our inner city communities. Of course, many would challenge the use of the word <Col N="2178" />&ldquo;living&rdquo; and say that they are surviving in spite of the daily trials they must endure.</P>
    <P>In summary, there are a great many measures of a very specific kind that can be taken to begin to address the problems and potential of Dublin. In the short time available to me here I have only been able to address a very few of them. Unless and until we address the heart of the problem &mdash; the unemployment crisis &mdash; which has turned Dublin into Ireland's biggest unemployment blackspot, Dublin will continue to be blighted, and many of its families and communities will see no reason to hope or to build for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin is a city in deep distress and in need of democratic revitalisation. The greater Dublin area which is now home to one-third of our population is a ravaged victim of neglect and abuse, inflicted by both national and local government for the past 25 years. Dublin has suffered so much for so long that its citizens have become almost numb to the cumulative damage. Since the late sixties this city has taken a sustained battering from the speculators eager to cash in on land prices and too many local councillors who have been equally eager to help them.</P>
      <P>The same sharp practice which blessed the demolition of so much of the city's architectural heritage and crushed it under the bulldozer to make way for quick profits, has wheeled and dealed with another generation of developers, blatantly reversing planning decisions on green belts and amenities and savaging city streets and squares for major road links, which all lead elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have Dubliners gained over the last two decades? The answer can be given in stark figures. During the seventies there was a net increase of 33,000 jobs nationally, yet Dublin, the most heavily populated and industrialised part of the country got just 3 per cent of those jobs. During the eighties when Government policies led to the loss of a staggering 42,000 jobs between 1981 and 1989, a massive 64 per cent of these were lost in the capital. The fact that Dublin got so few new jobs in the seventies <Col N="2179" /> and had to bear almost two thirds of all job losses in the eighties provides irrefutable evidence of a policy of deliberate discrimination which must now be reversed.</P>
    <P>The blunt truth is that successive Ministers in all Governments have elbowed each other aside over the years in a stampede to put whatever money was available into their constituencies, and left behind them a blighted capital, pock-marked with derelict sites, stripped of its industrial base and robbed of its old communities. The Dubliners who were uprooted 20 and 30 years ago have made new homes and new communities against all the odds, in housing estates that were planned heedlessly as little more than outskirt wastelands. Even now many of these neighbourhoods have only the skeleton of resources available to them in shops, schools, parks and medical facilities.</P>
    <P>Over the years the people of Dublin have argued, fought and begged for the facilities for which there is such a crying need &mdash; a cheap and efficient transport system, a network of regional technical colleges to educate their children and a fair share of the jobs. However, they have met with the most cynical form of Government manipulation by the &ldquo;lick and a promise&rdquo; method &mdash; a touch here, some window-dressing there, and a virtual sandstorm of promises at every election campaign.</P>
    <P>Dublin has survived on a diet of assurances that once this or that was secured boom times would follow. But where are the boom times? The Custom House Dock development which we were told would regenerate the old docks area of the city has come to nothing for the beleaguered people who live and work there. The Temple Bar scheme, one of the most hopeful and imaginative inner city plans, offers inducements for entrepreneurs but no provision for housing people which would give the area character and continuity.</P>
    <P>Urgent action is needed in several areas if the process of decline is to be reversed and Dublin restored to its place <Col N="2180" /> of pride as our capital city. Clearly an urgent job creation programme for the city is the most immediate need, as so many of the other problems arise directly from unemployment and poverty. There must also be a massive housing rescue plan to tackle the growing housing waiting lists and a comprehensive housing maintenance programme to upgrade existing housing stock.</P>
    <P>The harsh reality of life in Dublin as we approach the end of the 21st century is that many of our citizens live in constant fear of crime. To deal with this we need to establish a closer relationship between the Garda and communities in which they work, more gardaí on the beat and more patrol cars to target vandalism black spots such as open spaces, bus stops, DART stations and shopping centres where the greatest level of petty crime and vandalism occurs. We need to improve the juvenile liaison officer scheme to deal with crime and vandalism among teenagers and, in particular, pre-teen children. There should also be a proper remedial detention centre for young offenders who need custodial care.</P>
    <P>The level of traffic in the city also requires attention. The city is being strangled by the 55,000 cars and commercial vehicles which stream across the 25 canal bridges every morning between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. and which return again in the evening. We need a vastly improved public transport system with a light rail system as its centrepiece. Such a system should be priced and scheduled so as to encourage people who use cars at present to leave them at home.</P>

      <P>We will spend the next few hours talking about a motion on which, if it had been put together properly, we could have offered very good suggestions in terms of what might be in the best interest of Dublin. When one mentions a Greater Dublin Authority one could be talking about anywhere. As the Minister asked earlier, are we talking about areas on the outskirts of County Dublin, as far as Bray, Kildare and Meath? We are not talking about a cohesive unit or about local democracy. Some Members on the other side have regularly spoken about the lack of local democracy, but here they are suggesting a huge unwieldly authority. It is difficult enough for the councils to operate in Dublin city at present, but from the proposals in this motion, it would be even more difficult for a Greater Dublin Authority to operate. In the past 12 months very little work has been done by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the work carried out by the previous council, of which the Deputy opposite was a member. The inner city was brought back to life. The Financial Services Centre and the Custom House Docks were developed, sites which up to then were derelict. There was no life whatsoever on the quays, as far as the Point building, but that building and other areas along the quays were developed in that period. Much urban renewal work was also carried out. In Phibsboro new houses were built by the private sector while houses were refurbished in the inner city by the local authority and old blocks of flats were renewed. This is the type of work that can be done by local democracy. Some people may say that the Minister should have less control and that we should not have to go to the Minister for approval for every penny spent. However, it is the Exchequer that pays <Col N="2182" /> in the end and there must be some regulation. I have often criticised Departments and said that we should not need their approval but at the end of the day it is the taxpayer who pays for the work that is carried out.</P>
    <P>At present the area of the quays and Christchurch Place is buzzing with activity. There have been more visitors to this area this summer than was the case two years ago. The whole place has been revitalised. When the previous council were elected O'Connell Street was like Saigon before the war, with signs all over the place. It was a most dreadful looking street. The councillor opposite together with the other councillors encouraged the people who owned the property in the area to take down some of the signs in order to improve the city. That whole area has also been pedestrainised. It is wrong to say that our city is falling apart. It is coming back to life and is a great capital city. I agree that there are problems &mdash; it would be foolish to say that no city has problems &mdash; but in the county and city councils there are 130 councillors and I believe that number is sufficient to do the work.</P>
    <P>There is a crime problem in Dublin, as in all capital cities. We should be concerned about petty crime in Dublin city because it causes misery to many people. We are tackling the problem although not as fast as I would like. This House has set up a Joint Committee on Crime, of which I am a member, who are considering ways and means of combating crime. A Greater Dublin Authority would have additional knowledge in this regard. Would they suggest that we introduce a separate police force, the Baile Átha Cliath Garda? I certainly would not support such a move. The crime problem must be tackled in an overall sense.</P>
    <P>There is high unemployment in parts of Dublin city &mdash; it is the major problem in the country &mdash; including my constituency, but I do not believe that a Greater Dublin Authority would solve that problem any better than we can. If there is more that can be done I would certainly try to do so. The day this country solves the unemployment problem <Col N="2183" /> is the day it will be the greatest country in which to live. The only black spot is that many of our sons and daughters cannot get jobs.</P>

      <P>However, another level of bureaucracy will not help solve that problem. Education in the Dublin area is excellent. I have suggested in this House that there should be positive discrimination towards the inner city. Various Ministers have said that they would appoint extra remedial teachers, and they have done so. Perhaps these is still not a sufficient number, but extra appointments cost money.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned housing. As a Dublin city councillor I never want to see the building of vast housing estates again. At the time these estates were built it was a good idea but that is not the case now. There is a new programme of refurbishment of our present housing stock and that is where we should start. We should build up our stock. The Minister introduced a social housing programme and one of its best proposals is the shared housing scheme which will allow people to live where they wish. Under the present structure it is very difficult to transfer local authority tenants. We need flexibility. We can be proud of the new houses we are building for senior citizens in the Sheriff Street area of Dublin. They are beautiful. We can also be proud of the refurbishing of houses at the Five Lamps off Dunne Street. Beautiful new homes are being built on old properties.</P>

    <P>With regard to the transport problem, the Government have looked at it and have agreed to implement a proper public transport system. There is consensus on that issue. When in Government Fine Gael and Labour suggested a greater Dublin authority. They might as well have thrown a pack of cards in the air and watched them fall because we ended up with nothing. Under the 1991 Act three new authorities were formed, following discussions with the city manager, and we now have three county councils plus Dublin City Council. I would not like to see anything happen to the city council and I will never support the abolition of Dublin Corporation. They have made the city what it is. To do away with Dublin City Council would be to do away with local democracy. Local democracy is very important. The ordinary citizen can speak to me as a councillor and as a TD. I would not like the council to be turned into some super authority answerable <Col N="2185" /> to some third House of the Oireachtas. It would be ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I have been actively involved in Dublin throughout my life and I am proud of what has happened in the past few years to bring it back to life. One could instance the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, the Custom House Docks site, the Custom House, the Casino in Marino which is a most beautiful building and the Memorial Gardens which were restored. Those improvements were carried out in most cases by the Government.</P>

      <P>Crime is a problem in Dublin. Unfortunately, it is by no means a problem peculiar to Dublin or to any other Irish city. This is a worldwide phenomenon, a feature of urban areas with high population densities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a third or fourth generation Dubliner whose father wrote a very interesting book on the city, <i>Dublin Made Me,</i> the words of Deputy Stafford put the matter into perspective. This motion deals with the crime rate and so on but at the same time it is fair to compare Dublin of yester year with the Dublin of today. What I see happening in Dublin, particularly in the city centre, gives me great heart. The Dublin of 20 years ago <Col N="2187" /> and the Dublin of 1992 are totally different cities. There has been tremendous development in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>Tackling crime is a stated priority of the Government and of the Minister for Justice. This has been shown in recent years by the extensive resources and support provided for the law enforcement agencies, by the many anti-crime initiatives and by the ambitious legislative programme which has been pursued. I would refer the House to the law enforcement package published in December 1991 which outlines the approach and the measures the Minister for Justice is taking this year to preserve law and order and to protect the community against crime. The package deals with vitally important measures such as neighbourhood watch, the development of Garda community policing arrangements, the Garda schools programme and the juvenile liaison officer scheme. Specifically in relation to urban crime, the package provides for an increased emphasis by all the agencies under the aegis of the Minister but in particular for gardaí and for practical measures to deal with crime problems being experienced in certain urban areas. In addition it provides that Garda assessment of policing requirements in areas with greatest difficulties will be updated on a continuing basis so that effective responses can be provided as and when required.</P>
    <P>Despite the best efforts of the Garda Síochána, the indications are that crime levels increased in Dublin last year. Immediate steps were taken by the Garda authorities to address the problem as soon as it became apparent that this upward crime trend was emerging. These steps included a highly targeted use of resources to deal with crime problems in different areas. This involved the stepping up of Garda activity on the streets, the use of uniformed and plain clothes patrols on foot and in marked and unmarked cars, and covert surveillance of known criminals in areas of high criminal activity.</P>
    <P>No effort has been or is being spared in reviewing, assessing and improving those <Col N="2188" /> Garda anti-crime strategies. The indications are that they are beginning to prove effective. The level of crime in our community is determined by those who choose the way of crime. Unfortunately they are for the most part juvenile. While law enforcement on its own will not stop young people offending, the range of interventions for young offenders is widening and becoming more effective every day. For example, the services and special projects provided by the probation and welfare service has been extended. The Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme has been totally revamped. The Garda have embarked on an innovative schools programme and additional detention facilities for young offenders have been and will continue to be provided. These services alone cannot provide the climate of caring, guidance and responsibility which is required to keep young people out of trouble.</P>
    <P>Community support for this type of approach is there. The experience of the Garda community relations section is proof of this. Over the years the gardaí have experienced an overwhelming community response to the introduction of a number of community-based schemes. The community policing schemes have put the members of the force in closer contact with the community they serve and home and property are better protected through the development of neighbourhood watch schemes in urban areas. The Minister for Justice is convinced that the way forward in dealing with crime is through increased community involvement. I share this view and I look forward to participation of all sectors of the community in helping the gardaí to deal with crime in Dublin.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of particular concern to urban communities is public disorder by young people, about which the Minister for Justice feels strongly. To deal with such situations, the Minister for Justice intends to update the law in relation to certain public order offences. The proposals which he is considering include the creation of offences relating to (a) persons being found drunk or under the influence of drugs in such circumstances <Col N="2189" /> that they are a danger to themselves or to others; (b) the use of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place and (c) disorderly conduct as, for instance, shouting, singing or boisterous conduct between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. in circumstances which cause annoyance to other persons in the neighbourhood. These new offences would carry the power of arrest and liability to substantial fines. If drink were involved the gardaí would have power to confiscate it on the spot. Presumably that would not include drink consumed.</P>
    <P>In addition the Minister is giving priority to the preparation of a new Juvenile Justice Bill which will update and replace existing legislation. These legislative reforms will considerably strengthen the hands of the gardaí in dealing with juvenile crime. It is important that we do not fall into the trap of seeing crime in a one-dimensional way. Crime is a multi-faceted problem with roots which are both deep and extensive and we must begin to look at how the response to crime can be expanded to provide a more broadly based approach.</P>
    <P>Urban crime is a complex problem which calls for a response from many agencies and Departments, as well as from the gardaí and the criminal justice system. This is why an inter-departmental working group are involved in preparing a special report on crime in areas which have been hard hit by criminal activity. It is expected that this review will be completed shortly and will be of major importance not only for the law enforcement agencies but for all the key Departments, including the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice intends to act on that report as a priority. The crime position is being kept under constant review by the Garda authorities and all appropriate action has been and will continue to be taken by them effectively to tackle crime in Dublin.</P>

      <P>We all recognise Dublin as famous in history and in culture. I am very proud to be a true Dubliner and <Col N="2190" /> to have been a member of Dublin City Council since 1985. I do not believe that the proposed authority would meet the needs of Dublin. If it did, I would wholeheartedly support it. I am pleased I am speaking after my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has adequately covered the concerns of most people in relation to crime. Crime is not unique to Dublin or to any capital city.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell referred to urban decline. Much work has yet to be tackled in Dublin but it will not be tackled by what is proposed this evening. We can recognise the authorities that are in place and give them more powers and resources. The appointment of a regional director is essential and this proposal is being looked at by some bodies such as the Chamber of Commerce and others who have requested such an appointment. The authorities can work effectively within the existing structures if they adopt a co-ordinated approach. Dublin City Council of which I am a member have done trojan work over the past number of years. We have enhanced and improved our city and we are continuing to look at ways in which we can improve the quality of life for the citizens of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Members opposite, let me say, as the late Deputy John Kelly would have said, while I am very fond personally of <Col N="2191" /> Deputy Stafford his complacency about the problems facing the city is staggering. Equally staggering was the presentation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the justice problems in the city. In the very short time available to me I will confine my remarks to the problem of juvenile crime and the problems young people face.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that a small number of additional places were provided for juveniles, but the sad fact is that it is actually easier for a child in need to get a place in a home for young offenders than to get a place in care which might prevent him coming before the juvenile justice system. There is a serious inadequacy in our provisions for children who are in stressful situations at home and may become offenders if they are not caught early enough. This is one of my priorities. Fine Gael wish to raise many issues on this motion but I wish to concentrate on unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Stafford said that while Dublin has a large unemployment problem, it is the same all over the country. In fact, it is worse in Dublin. It is a statistical fact that the average percentage rate of unemployment in the country is in the low twenties, the average rate of unemployment in the greater Dublin area ranges from 33 per cent to 35 per cent. The Deputy knows and I know &mdash; we both represent northside constituencies &mdash; that in parts of our constituencies, and in parts of the west and south sides of the city, the rate of unemployment ranges from 70 per cent to 80 per cent. It is important that in this debate we should put it firmly on the record of this House and put it firmly in the minds of policymakers on the Government side, that Dublin more than anywhere else in the country is suffering from the highest level of unemployment. Dublin suffers very seriously from the effects of emigration. If you examine the sixth year cohorts in the past year from particular schools you will find that perhaps two out of 30 are still in this country, and this applies even in privileged areas of the city. The city has a higher rate of unemployment than <Col N="2192" /> anywhere else in the country and this is inadequately acknowledged and addressed. I would like to see the IDA acknowledging this and devising policies to meet the problem.</P>
    <P>I believe a properly constructed Dublin authority would be able to argue this point. If the local authorities were given the types of powers suggested in this motion, they would be able to address the problem a great deal better. I am particularly concerned about the level of unemployment in certain areas of the city. We have looked for designated area status for the shopping centre in Ballymun but although this status was given to Tallaght and the inner city areas and had the desired effects. Ballymun, an area of high unemployment, has been refused. The Department of the Environment are committed to spending in the order of £50 million on refurbishing the estate but are refusing to grant the shopping centre designated area status, which would have a net cash impact on the estate of hundreds of thousands of pounds. If designated area status was granted it would mean that the area would have a viable shopping centre which would provide substantial employment, as has been the experience in Tallaght. Although the shopping centre would not be anything near the scale of the Tallaght centre, it would be enormously important for the locality.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has left the House but I know the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, will ensure the Minister is informed that I made this point particularly because I know he will look at it further and I hope he will pay particular attention to this local problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe Dublin can do better, and far better than it is doing at present under this archaic, creaking Government with what passes for city government doled out under the present administration. What other capital city in Europe would accept a situation where the elected city representatives have no say in the bus and rail services in the city; no role in promoting the city as a place in which to do business; no say in how <Col N="2193" /> many houses should be built for the homeless or no say in the running of a major recreational park, the Phoenix Park? What other capital city would allow three separate development plans, three separate road authorities to administer one city? The reality is that Dublin is a city where no one is in charge. Authority is scattered through every conceivable agency in the Department but the pieces of the jigsaw which are so vital to creating a coherent approach to solving Dublin's problems are scattered and they will never come together in a coherent approach to any issue facing the city.</P>
      <P>The greatest problem facing us is unemployment. Few people realise the extent of the decline of Dublin over the past ten years. One-third of the industrial jobs in Dublin have gone over the past ten years. Half of Dublin's building workers are out of work and the key sectors which were the economic backbone of working Dublin have almost disintegrated in the heart of Dublin. The reason up to 70 per cent of people in certain corporation and local authority estates are unemployed is that those vital sectors have been allowed to decay. There is no authority trying to promote Dublin and trying to secure employment for Dublin. The reality is that Dublin faces immense handicaps &mdash; Dublin port is in decline and the Government have no policy to deal with the decline of the port. Over the past two years we have also had huge losses in the aviation industry because Aer Lingus are hampered by artificial restrictions on the possibility of opening up the US tourist market.</P>
      <P>Fewer children in Dublin go on to third level education than in any part of the country. Everyone knows that people who have third level education have immensely better opportunities in the job market. Dublin is systematically losing out in this race. Traffic congestion in the city costs £100 million a year and crime is costing £80 million each year in the loss of and damage to property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2194" /> Last night the Minister for the Environment made a most frightful response to this debate. He scoffed at the idea of a greater Dublin authority and derided the idea of setting up local democratic bodies which are closer to the people. The reality is that the Minister's dismissive response would be similar to those who some years ago scoffed at the idea of a united Europe and that decision-making within a united Europe could be delegated down to local communities. Although this Minister and his Department occupy the most prestigious building in the city, the Custom House, they have no appreciation of the city's problems. Let us look at their social housing programme which was introduced supposedly to address the problem of the 8,000 homeless people in Dublin. The report to Dublin Corporation shows that only 19 applications under the shared ownership scheme have been processed and only 36 sites have been approved &mdash; yet we have to cater for 8,000 homeless families.</P>

      <P>Members complain repeatedly about the democratic deficit from Brussels but the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, and the staff in the Custom House could tutor the most equivocal Eurocrat about how to keep the people and their representatives down in a place of supplication and subservience. It was depressing to see Fianna Fáil giving the people of Dublin, during a recent local election campaign, the idea that Dublin was to be promised direct access to moneys from the EC Structural Funds. It was to have a local housing construction programme maintained; it was to be given a role as an enterprise agency offering grants to industry; Garda numbers were to be increased by 1,400, most of whom were to be in the city of Dublin; Dublin's councils were to be <Col N="2195" /> given a role in education and in the fight against crime. These were solemn promises made by Fianna Fáil prior to the local elections. Not only were those promises not honoured but this Government have turned their back on the whole concept of devolving power locally.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael stands for the idea of devolution, of putting power back into the hands of people so that they can tackle in a meaningful way the economic and the unemployment crisis which is tearing Dublin apart. Dublin needs a radically new Government structure, it needs a greater city authority, a Lord Mayor with real authority based on election by the people and much better top management with the ability to make and deliver decisions in a meaningful way. If we could implement the concept of a Single Greater Dublin Authority dealing with its transport and economic problems we would be going a long way towards resolving the huge crisis facing Dublin at present.</P>

      <P>I shall be brief because I am anxious to allow Deputy Owen in afterwards. Fine Gael's purpose in putting down this motion is to highlight the serious and ever-increasing cycle of violence affecting our city and its suburbs. My contribution this evening will illustrate instances of serious crime, vandalism and general terrorisation of residents by youths in our communities who seem to have access to unlimited amounts of alcohol and drugs leading to a complete breakdown of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Empty beer cans and cider bottles litter some of the laneways in my own constituency, a consequence of very poor planning over the years. This litter is evidence of hard nights drinking by thugs who seemingly get their kicks from terrorising residents. Mothers and <Col N="2196" /> fathers are prevented from getting young children to sleep, those in employment are prevented from having a good night's sleep and thus cannot get to work in the morning. Older residents, particularly those living alone, fear for their lives while these thugs shout and scream wildly out of control and play their loud music.</P>
    <P>In one such estate in my own constituency, not far from my own home in Baldoyle, this weekend residents had their windows smashed, their walls torn down around them and they were verbally abused by drunken youths. This problem has reached crisis proportions and the Minister for Justice will have to provide an immediate remedy. In my opinion there are two solutions to this problem: one is for the Minister for the Environment to introduce legislation granting enabling powers to local authorities to close the laneways where these youths congregate in such large numbers. This would mean that rigid and time-consuming planning procedures could be by-passed. Second, in order to combat this unsocial behaviour, a dramatic increase in the number of Garda foot patrols is urgently required. At present gardaí who are carrying out their duties to the best of their ability find their efforts frustrated due to the lack of manpower on the beat. In my own area, which is policed by Howth Garda station, we have 31 gardaí and we have been constantly seeking more gardaí. They cover an area larger than Tralee, yet in Tralee there are 12 or 14 extra gardaí. The garda on the beat can deter crime and that is what we need in the area.</P>
    <P>The DART line which runs right through my constituency of Dublin North-East is used as a conduit by youths and criminals who break into homes adjacent to this line. The line itself is not protected from trespass and as a result stolen goods, beer and cider supplies to under-age drinkers are regularly transported along the DART line. It also provides a ready-made escape route for such criminals. I am calling on the <Col N="2197" /> Government and Iarnród Éireann to introduce, as a matter of the utmost urgency, proper security fencing and a transport police force to protect this line in order, once and for all, to put a stop of this litany of vandalism and what can only be described as wanton destruction. Measures must be taken to protect the staff of Iarnród Éireann who on a regular basis have been victims of beatings and have been threatened with shotguns and knives. Recent reports indicate that last year 32 armed robberies took place on the line and 22 hold-ups have occurred in the area of Kilbarrack and other DART stations. The serious lack of custodial places for criminals of all ages and especially juvenile offenders must be addressed and when sentences are imposed they should be fully served.</P>
    <P>In this and other matters there is a need for an overall approach to Dublin city. Local government reform in Dublin County Council is progressing at a steady pace and the three independent local authorities in Dublin county have now been set up. In my own local authority area &mdash; the Fingal area &mdash; there is a serious and ongoing housing crisis with 682 persons on the housing list. This causes intolerable burdens on families due to overcrowding and with the high rate of unemployment they see no way out of their predicament. These people will readily tell you that Government and local authorities have generally let them down. The cost of providing housing to the people in my constituency would amount to £25 million. The Government should declare a housing crisis and immediately establish a Single Greater Dublin Authority with an overall supremo who would co-ordinate the efforts of the local authorities and whose task should be to root out the evils that affect our city.</P>

      <P>In this debate I am reminded of an old television show called &ldquo;The Naked City&rdquo; which related instances in the life of a person in a city. At the end of that programme a voice would say there are a million people in the naked city &mdash; this was one of them. There are a million inhabitants in Dublin city and county, all of whom, sadly, would have stories to relate of their own experience of the naked city. Except for the well-off I am afraid most of the stories would be sorrowful. There might be a story from one of the families on the 2,000-plus housing list of Dublin County Council, the young mother abandoned by her husband who has to divide up her children among her sisters and brothers and has to wait until the council can provide a home for her, many months later. In the meantime she lives in sorrow, separated and without her children. The story might be from a young couple who are forced to live in a ten feet by 12 feet room given to them by the family knowing that great anguish is created for the other members of that household where older brothers and sisters have to share box rooms. The story may come from one of the vast housing estates of Dublin West where unemployment figures as high as 80 per cent are not unknown and where there is bad or non-existent transport systems, where there are no health services, no schools, créche or community facilities, and where judicious use of the lottery could improve people's lives. There are many large estates where local authorities have had to abandon all maintenance programmes through lack of a decent rate support grant from this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The story could come from the business person, or the job creator in our society, who is bowed down because of <Col N="2199" /> bad, outdated laws on valuation and by a 400 per cent increase in their rates, thereby necessitating the closing of the business and increasing the dole queues. The cry from many parts of the country is that: &ldquo;Dublin gets everything&rdquo; but at a recent seminar a senior trade union leader made it clear that Dublin is not getting its fair share. <i>Per capita</i> Dublin is getting three times less from the Structural Funds than the rest of the country. The Minister has an opportunity to use the Structural and Cohesion Funds to improve and create a decent environment for the many thousands of people who are struggling to make a living and bring up a family in this city and country.</P>
    <P>Let us have a decision on a light rail system to improve transport out to the northside of the city &mdash; to the airport and to towns such as Swords &mdash; where most of the poverty exists. Let us see an improvement in people's conditions so that problems such as marriage breakdown, child abuse and wife battering are not exacerbated by the lack of employment and a decent quality of life. The problems in Dublin are potentially corrosive and explosive unless this Government do something about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for his generosity. I will concentrate on only one subject, and I hope to do it in two minutes.</P>
      <P>The most frequent complaint made to me by my constituents is in relation to crime.</P>
      <P>It is not just elderly. Every age group and every sector of society show the same anxieties and fears. The fears of Dubliners for their own security and that of their property is symbolised for me by the dog &mdash; the snarling dog at the side gate or behind the front door as you walk up the path; the dog walking the elderly man rather than the man walking the dog; the young girl relying on the dog for protection as she goes to the shops; the dog straining on the leash at the local store after closing time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> Man's best friend is now the symbol of his insecurity and his fear.</P>
    <P>Unemployment, lack of housing or inadequate housing, poverty, bad planning or planning ignored, vandalism, traffic congestion, litter &mdash; all of these matters are a source of concern, to a greater or less extent, for all Dubliners. Improvement in social conditions will make their own impact on crime and the elimination of these injustices and inadequacies must of course be at the forefront of political action.</P>
    <P>But for the great majority of Dubliners at present the chief objective is to have protection for himself, his family and his property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 16,000 Dublin Corporation flats in the capital, 1,000 of which are senior citizen flats and mostly in good condition. Of the remaining 15,000 about two-thirds, or 10,000, are in need of major refurbishment. In fact they are a disgrace to Government &mdash; both local and national.</P>
      <P>No Member of this House would aspire to live in these conditions, nor would we rest happily if our children lived in them. Yet we expect our citizens to reside in these deplorable conditions with dark, dank stairwells where drug pushers prey on vulnerable youth. Broken sewers, poor public lighing, leaking roofs, unheated flats, poor public spaces and dereliction are the order of the day. Why do we continue to allow this to happen?</P>
      <P>The representations made by members of this House week in and week out for years has been ignored. Deputations to the corporation and the Minister are ignored. It will be too late when we have a Los Angeles type eruption in this city. People are already out in Marrowbone Lane every other week blocking the roads simply to draw some attention to the basic needs that they have and which are being ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To spend £10,000 per unit, including common entrances and open spaces, would cost £100 million. To finance £100 <Col N="2201" /> million on the local loans fund would cost £10.4 million per year. Yet Dublin Corporation are spending £20 million a year on housing maintenance, much of it on these very flats. The most inefficient area of Dublin Corporation spending is the maintenance department. This has been highlighted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on maintenance generally by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Why are we not prepared to take on this vested interest which is wasting tax-payers' money and put that money to use refurbishing inner city flats so that people can live in decent accommodation?</P>
    <P>Poor planning, inefficiencies and lack of commitment by Government, which has now had two successive Ministers for the Environment from outside Dublin is at the centre of this housing horror.</P>
    <P>Inner cities have shops, churches, schools, many now abandoned, and sewerage systems. It makes sense to keep living communities there, yet there is no action because there is no Government commitment.</P>
    <P>The city of Dublin has not been totally abandoned by our leaders. In winding up this debate I want to take the opportunity, in view of the recent press comment, particularly by people who are not part of what I would call mainstream journalism, to pay a warm tribute to the religious leaders of all denominations &mdash; Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Muslim &mdash; who tend their flocks in Dublin city both day and night. I am probably one of the few Deputies in this Parliament who represents all of those communities.</P>
    <P>I want to say a special word of encouragement to the Catholic religious, both men and women, who may feel unappreciated in these times.</P>
    <P>Those commentators, many of them not mainstream journalists, who gloat when they see an opportunity to kick the Catholic Church should be asked to acknowledge the great caring work done in every parish of our capital whatever the social standing of the parishioners.</P>
    <P>These are the men and women who, <Col N="2202" /> though tempted with all the shortcomings of humanity that all of us have, have unselfishly dedicated their lives to something they believe in and have made huge human sacrifices in the process.</P>
    <P>When State social services close on Friday, where do our communities turn in time of need? Who organises the youth clubs, women's groups and self-help groups? Who brings consolation to the bereaved and downtrodden?</P>
    <P>The heroic contribution made by religious people to this capital city has gone unacknowledged.</P>
    <P>For too long we have taken their vocational commitment for granted without as much as saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;. I call on this House this evening to salute the army of selfless religious and lay people who have dedicated their lives to the service of their fellow citizens. One hundred thousand thanks to them would be an inadequate expression of our appreciation of their worth. If the State could match the religious and lay organisations in committing resources and time many of the dreadful problems this city faces might be well taken care of.</P>
    <P>I feel in particular, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the State has not attempted to put its organisational power, its commitment or its resources to work in dealing with crime. What about reforming our legal system? What reforms have come out of this Government or its predecessors since 1987? They set up a committee on crime under enormous pressure to succeed the one on which Deputy Wallace and I were members until 1987. However they give the committee no powers whatsoever in a society where our capital is crime ridden, where people are living behind alarm systems and shutters. One cannot get out of one's car in this city without using an alarm or securing it with a lock. We have a city where loitering with intent is the order of the day. There are sometimes groups of up to 40 or 50 youths loitering in my own constituency and not just in one particular area but all over the place. <Col N="2203" /> It is commonplace to see gangs of people gathering and loitering with intent and interfering with the freedom of other people to leave their homes, old people and women in particular; young children cannot be sent to the cornershop for a message because of these go-boys who are interfering with their rights.</P>
    <P>What action are we getting from this Government? There is no action. Why are we not taking action against those loitering with intent when the rights of people are being interfered with? Why do we have to live in a city full of shutters and alarms?</P>
    <P>Why is the drug epidemic on the way back again? Why is it being tolerated? Why is nothing being done to deal with it? Why is it that when we set up a crime committee to deal with it, we do not give them the powers they need? Why is it that in the parks of our city, stolen goods and drugs are being sold openly? Where is the law? Where is the order? Where are the crime committee's powers that this Government have been talking about? Where is the Dáil reform they have been talking about?</P>
    <P>Why have we not taken on the task of dealing with joblessness? Why is it that our only answer to joblessness is the gimmick of setting up yet another toothless parliamentary committee consisting of backbenchers, which the Government will not participate in while denigrating others for not taking it seriously? Where is the reform? Where is the commitment? Where is the great input from the Progressive Democrats who have not even come into the House here tonight to listen to the debate?</P>
    <P>This Government are a callous Government, a gimmicky Government, a Government too fearful to act. They have no sense of innovation because they have no sense of the deprivation that <Col N="2204" /> people have suffered. They are out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>They have no idea how to address the problem of transport in the city. Is it possible, for instance, that we could marry the cash rich agency of Aer Rianta with the cash starved agency of CIE and its subsidiaries? Is it possible to take up the suggestion I made some months ago and consider using Baldonnel as a second regional airport, which Deputy Lawlor kindly supported, that we might be able to use Aer Rianta to invest its cash in a rapid transport system that would connect those airport through the busy suburbs of this city, through the DCU, on out to meet up with the DART in Swords, with a similar connecting rail line on the south of the city? Is that not worthy of examination? Where are the new ideas and the innovation?</P>
    <P>The Government are bankrupt of ideas and do not care about Dublin. If we look at the Government we will see that Ministers have been chosen for geographical reasons and not for their ability or because they care about Dublin. Dublin is going down the tubes and all members of the Government want to do is get their backsides into their chauffeur driven cars. I would not deny any Minister this facility but I expect them to earn it, along with their pay and perks as they are not rewards that go with office. The Government have an opportunity to serve but they have refused to take it and have let the people of Dublin down badly. They will be judged on this at the next general election. I urge the House to support this motion which I wholeheartedly commend to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of raising this important matter this evening. I regret that the Minister for Energy is unable to be present but I welcome the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney. I am sharing my time with Deputy Barnes our party spokesperson on the marine, who is particularly concerned about these latest reports.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to obtain from the Minister this evening the fullest possible information in relation to the reported incidence of radioactive pollution in seaweed off the Sellafield coast. At this stage I am sure the Minister will have had the Radiological Institute examine the position in order to analyse and assess just how significant is this pollution, its source and causes. I was very concerned, as is Deputy Barnes, that newspaper reports indicated that British Nuclear Fuels have no idea how there could be such a level of contamination in seaweed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister specifically what were the levels of the radioactive pollution found and what was the extent of that pollution? Was there any incident report or is there, at this time, any reasonable explanation as to how this should have occurred? The Minister will be aware that her party and the Minister in particular, promised the world at large that he and the Irish Government would do all in their power to have the Sellafield reprocessing plant closed. At this point it appears that the Minister has given up on this objective. Therefore, it behoves the Government to maintain a particularly watchful brief in relation to the environmental impact of this enormous reprocessing facility on the other side of the Irish Sea. Will she say <Col N="2211" /> whether any tests have been conducted on this side of the Irish Sea to ascertain whether there is pollution of concern here? Have our shorelines been examined? Is the Minister satisfied with the level of reporting? Was there any kind of incident report or any reporting at EC level?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flaherty for sharing her time with me. I shall concentrate on the implications of this latest report as it pertains to my area, as spokesperson for my party on the marine. What gave rise to most concern was the fact that discovery of this radioactive vegetation on the beaches of the Cumbrian coast near the Sellafield nuclear processing plant was suppressed until it was leaked to the media in the form of a British Nuclear Fuels report, or so it was reported. It was also reported that the Sellafield environmental team had found that vegetation along the Irish Sea coastline two months ago. Perhaps the allegation contained in the reports we have read is wrong &mdash; I should like to think it is because, if not, it is frightening. Not alone was such fact suppressed for quite a long time but it would appear a discovery was made only because of a specific leak from a British Nuclear Fuels report. If that is true we on this side of the Irish Sea have real cause for concern because that would mean there was deliberate suppression of information. Again, as was recorded, this new plant life is alleged to have contained ruthenium, zirconium and niobium, established to have come from effluent emanating from that nuclear installation, that it was that combination leading to the creation of that plant life that was found there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the implications for human, plant and animal life the reason we in Ireland would share this concern is that the main oceanic productive areas fishing waters are always located near the coastline where 80 per cent of production of biomass takes place. Therefore, the narrow Irish Sea and its coastline provide most fish, plant life and biomass. Obviously if they <Col N="2212" /> become contaminated by radioactive pollution then its implications are indeed serious.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment will reply to this debate because I know she has a real interest in the third point I want to make, which is that fish stocks do not observe national boundaries nor can it be maintained that any one country owns such fish stocks. All countries have a responsibility and obligation to protect and conserve what are the international interdependent fruits of world oceans and the countries they surround. That is why I contend that the pollution at Sellafield, any attempt to conceal such incidence and the level of information we receive must lead us to believe that the most urgent area must be tackled at European level, after ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, pertains not alone to an environmental policy of great strength but the establishment of a commission to ensure that European Union, in its strengthened condition, can collectively take on an erring member state to ensure that we in Ireland are not constantly on the defensive or attempting to fight a lone battle. Approximately a year ago it was advocated at European level that a Eureka programme in the field of marine science, technology and law should be implemented as a matter of priority. It is my hope that the Minister of State may be able to inform us that that will be a reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Flaherty and Barnes for raising this issue on the Adjournment. First of all I want to apologise for the absence of the Minister for Energy who is in Brussels on official business. As Deputies will know, this matter was raised in the Seanad last week when the Government expressed, as I will now, our concern at the discovery once again of radioactive substances on the west Cumbrian coast of the Irish Sea close to Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unexplained and unexpected discovery of vegetation with such high levels <Col N="2213" /> of contamination must obviously be of concern to us all. As Deputy Barnes said, fish know no boundaries; neither does pollution, which in transboundary. The Earth Summit which will be held in Rio de Janeiro in a few weeks' time will discuss, in the main, the international nature of pollution. Although this matter will not be discussed at this summit, pollution from whatever source has to be of concern to all of us and, in particular, to me as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flaherty said, British Nuclear Fuels have told us that their scientists are not yet aware of what caused this contamination. Therefore, I am not in a position to say what it is. Nevertheless, I will give the House the background to this issue. British Nuclear Fuels carry out monitoring of the tide lines on the west Cumbria coast close to Sellafield. During March, April and May of this year a highly radioactive contaminated substance like a coral which had the appearance of grass was discovered. I do not know when the authorities here become aware of this discovery and my brief from the Department of Energy does not give this information. I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Energy and find out when the authorities here become aware of this discovery.</P>
    <P>The substance is a known substance; it is a known organism in the marine environment. It contains the same characteristics as the discharge which comes from Sellafield. Therefore, one does not need to be a genius to be able to link the two substances, despite the fact that British Nuclear Fuels do not seem to be able to tell us the cause of the contamination. I think most people would be concerned first about the dangers to human beings. I understand from the Radiological Protection Institute that human beings would be in danger from the substance only if they were exposed to it, held a piece of it, or it was close to their skin for more than 30 hours. I <Col N="2214" /> believe it is only at that stage they would reach the exposure danger levels.</P>
    <P>In relation to Irish waters, the Nuclear Energy Board and the Radiological Protection Institute, a body which had a rather long gestation period and which I am happy to say is now in being, carry out regular monitoring and sampling along the seashore, particularly of seaweed. I am happy to be able to tell the House that last week they took a sample of similar seaweed from Dublin Bay and have told me that there is no contamination of this level and that the level of radioactive contamination does not differ from levels taken any time during the past two years. They have assured the Minister and the Department of Energy that there is no danger to the Irish shoreline and no radiological danger from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I have to say that it remains the Government's position to see Sellafield closed down. As a Government we do not favour nuclear power, not because we have any inherent ideological problem with it but because of the dangers of nuclear power stations and the problems in dealing with waste from them. This remains the position of the Government. We have said repeatedly that what we need at European level is an independent inspectorate. We can shout all we like at the British and other countries but they will not really listen to us. We need an independent inspectorate to be set up urgently at European level who will look at the transboundary problems caused by pollution and at the safety aspects of nuclear power stations. The Minister made this clear as late as last October at a European Council meeting and on two occasions in the European Parliament. He also made it clear to the previous Secretary of State for Energy and the former Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. Heseltine, the present Trade and Industry Secretary, who has responsibility for energy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the initiation of a legal case, the Deputies will be aware of the <Col N="2215" /> position taken by my party, which is still our position, in relation to this issue. We would like to be in a position to take a legal case, as would the Government. However, it would be highly irresponsible for the Government to take a legal case simply for the sake of it or as a PR exercise. First, it would be extremely embarrassing if we did not win; second, it would probably act as an endorsement to Sellafield if we were to lose and, third, it would cost enormous amounts of public money. I would not be in favour of the Government engaging in a PR exercise for the sake of it. The Government have been advised by the Attorney General and others that a sufficient case does not exist to take legal action. If the Radiological Protection Institute tell us that seaweed taken from Dublin Bay does not have a high level of radioactive contamination then obviously that is the case and we would not be able to prove any damage to the Irish population or coastline. The Minister has said time and time again &mdash; he discussed this with Greenpeace last year in my presence &mdash; that if a sufficient case can be shown to him where he has even a 50-50 chance of winning then he would not hesitate to recommend to the Government that we take such action.</P>
    <P>The Deputies raised two questions to which I do not have answers. The first was whether there was instant reporting and the second when we become aware of the problem. I do not know the answers to those questions but I will endeavour to get the answers tomorrow and convey them to the Deputies. The new information available to me, which obviously was not available when the debate in the Seanad took place &mdash; it took place very rapidly after this discovery &mdash; is that the seaweed from Dublin Bay which was tested by the Radiological Protection Institute last week showed no similar radioactive contamination. This should be an assurance that at least we <Col N="2216" /> on this side of the Irish Sea do not have to worry about these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moyihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for being present in the House. For the past number of years serious problems have been caused by the defective sewerage system in Kenmare. The building of a raw sewage treatment plant has been under consideration since 1987-88. At present the sewage flows into an outdated and undersized tank and finally into the River Finnihy. The water quality in the river at the point of entry of the sewerage pipe has seriously deteriorated. The mouth of the River Finnihy is 500 yards from a popular bathing beach at the back of the pier in Kenmare. This beach is much frequented by locals and a growing number of tourists. Raw sewage, which has been seen floating in this area, poses a severe health risk to people and is an embarrassment to an area which is striving to project a clean environmental image. In addition, the sewerage system which services some 30 houses in the Killowen area is not connected to the existing town system and the sewerage flows into the estuary of the river which is adjacent to the local golf course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kenmare is a rapidly expanding tourist centre. A large number of private houses, guesthouses, restaurants and a new hotel have recently been developed in the area. The inadequate sewerage system is not only an embarrassment to the people of the town but is a handicap to future development. There is no excellent community group in Kenmare. These people are extremely concerned about the possible damage which will be caused to the area if immediate steps are not taken to remedy the problems caused by the inadequate sewerage system. A modern treatment plant needs to be built so that <Col N="2217" /> the further development of this town as a major tourist centre can proceed unhindered.</P>
    <P>It is recognised not only in County Kerry but throughout the country that Kenmare is a pivotal area for tourism growth. I appeal to the Minister to resolve the problems beteen his Department and the county council so that the building of the new sewerage treatment plant can go ahead. As I said, Kenmare is a very important town from the point of view of tourism. The local community should be given the necessary help and support by national institutions to enable them to develop the tourism potential of the town. I again appeal to the Minister to resolve whatever problems exist between his Department and the county council so that this very embarrassing problem can be resolved. As I said, in the opinion of the local people this problem constitutes a serious health risk.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to deal with this matter. As Minister for the Environment, I am determined to do all I can to ensure that both domestic and industrial effluent is disposed of in a manner which is consistent with the preservation and protection of our natural environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environment Action Programme for this decade will see an investment of close on £1,000 million, covering water treatment and the provision of sanitary services throughout the country. In Kerry, in recent years £21 million has been provided for sewage treatment works and plans are at an advanced stage for Tralee, Dingle, Cahirciveen and Kenmare. In response to the Deputy's question, I had a close look at the position in Kenmare. I understand that the plans are at an advanced stage but I am still awaiting a planning certificate from Kerry County Council in relation to the upgrading of these facilities. The plans take account of the necessity to upgrade the services, which admittedly are inadequate, <Col N="2218" /> and also cater for the potential development of that region. As soon as I have the necessary certification from Kerry County Council we can proceed to the next stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to highlight a ludicrous anomaly in the supplementary welfare system arising from the current dispute in An Post which has left possibly thousands of dependants of postal workers destitute and without any means whatsoever. The supplementary welfare allowance is supposed to be the final safety net of the social welfare system. It is designed for people who have no entitlement to other social welfare payments or are in dire need. When people have no income they go to the supplementary welfare officer who assesses their needs under a number of headings and makes an appropriate payment. Those who are directly involved in an industrial dispute do not qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but payments are paid in respect of a dependent spouse or dependent children of those involved in a dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have been suspended as a result of the dispute in An Post have received payments for their spouses and children. However, there are between 700 and 800 postal workers who have not been suspended but have received no wages for the past few weeks because of the suspension of personnel in the wages section of An Post. Under the current supplementary welfare allowance system these people are deemed to be still in employment and thus ineligible for supplementary welfare allowance payments. Postal workers in this category who have gone to community welfare officers throughout the country have been told quite simply that they will get nothing. The majority of these workers are married, many with children. There are no precise figures available, but between <Col N="2219" /> 2,000 and 3,000 spouses and children have been left without any income because of this bureaucratic interpretation of the rules. The level of hardship cannot be overstated. They have no money to put food on the table or to pay the rent or mortgage.</P>
    <P>The irony is that if these staff members had been suspended or if they were on strike, even on unofficial strike, they would be getting payments for their dependants. I have been approached by a number of postal workers and their dependants in my constituency. One woman came to me in despair. Her husband is a postal worker in Sheriff Street and she has no job. This weekend will be the third without any income. In a family such as this money would be tight at the best of times but the total cut-off has left them in an impossible position. The rent is already in arrears and there is an ESB bill due. Although the woman is suffering from serious health problems she has been unable to go to the doctor simply because she does not have the money to pay. Repeated appeals to the local community welfare officer have drawn a blank. I know of another postman with five dependent children who was told that if he was suspended he would be getting £135 a week for his family but because he is still technically in employment in An Post he will get nothing.</P>
    <P>Seven workers took a High Court case against An Post over non-payment of wages and Judge Lardner, in a decision given on Tuesday, ruled in their favour. Unfortunately, he declined to admit the decision as a test case, which means that every worker in An Post who is not suspended but not in receipt of wages would have to take a similar case to establish their right to be paid. Judge Lardner said that the action of the company had caused hardship, distress and anxiety. I suggest that the application of the supplementary welfare allowance regulations has greatly added to the hardship, distress and anxiety. Given that there is <Col N="2220" /> no sign of an end to the dispute I would appeal to the Minister to review these regulations urgently and to make supplementary welfare available to those workers who have been denied their wages on the same basis as to suspended workers or to those on strike. It is surely wrong and immoral to victimise the children of those who are affected in this dispute.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom leithscéal a ghabháil thar ceann an Aire, nach bhfuil ar a chumas bheith i láthair inniú, agus labhróidh mise ar a shon.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is raising the question of entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance for dependants of postal workers who are still working but are not receiving payment due to disruption in the wages section of An Post arising from the suspension of staff. The entitlement of a person involved in a trade dispute to a supplementary welfare allowance is governed by section 203 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981. Section 203 (1) of that Act provides that persons who are without employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute at their place of employment are not entitled to an allowance in their own right but may be paid an allowance in respect of their dependants. The above section applies specifically to strikers and their dependants. However, An Post employees referred to in the Deputy's motion are outside of this category as they continue to work in An Post. Section 202(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, provides that persons who are engaged in full time work are debarred from receiving supplementary welfare allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute in An Post is centred in the Dublin area where the payment of supplementary welfare allowance is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board, who have been contacted with regard to the matter raised by the s<Col N="2221" /> sDeputy. I understand that approximately 700 An Post employees were suspended on 1 May and a further 600 were suspended on 12 May. It was open to these people to apply for supplementary welfare allowance for their dependants, and payments have commenced to those who qualified. Last week the board issued supplementary welfare allowance payments to the dependants of those suspended on 1 May and this week they commence payment to the dependants of those suspended on 12 May.</P>
    <P>However, the Eastern Health Board have refused to pay supplementary welfare allowance to persons who remain full time employees of An Post and who are not paid because of the problems in the wages department. The board take the view that these employees are precluded from receipt of supplementary welfare on foot of section 202(1) already mentioned and that the problem is an administrative one between them and their employers. Seven An Post employees who are in this position &mdash; who are not on strike &mdash; secured a High Court injunction on Monday, 18 May, obliging An Post management to pay their salaries which were held up following the suspension of staff in the wages section. I understand that there are 2,700 workers whose pay is also delayed as a result of these problems and it is open to them to seek similar redress.</P>
    <P>Under section 213 of the Act a health board may make a payment of supplementary welfare allowance to categories normally excluded by the provisions I mentioned earlier. These will arise only when there is an urgent need for income support and no other source of income is available. The question is a matter for determination by health boards and each case is decided on its merits. Deputy Gilmore raised the question whether there is a possibility of amending legislation or any further action that could be taken by the Minister in this regard. I will bring his views to <Col N="2222" /> the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare as soon as I possibly can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <P>It is not a coincidence that Deputy D'Arcy and myself are raising the same subject. It would not surprise me if 32 or 33 Deputies had raised the matter. The operation of the beef premium scheme is a disgrace. A written reply to a Dáil Question today refers to the special departmental task force who were set up to inquire into and sort out the anomalies which were occurring in this scheme and in other headage and premia schemes. It was not a satisfactory reply. The reply referred to the number of applications that had already been paid in respect of 1991 and how they exceeded the number paid in 1990. That is not the point. The point is about justice. There are probably hundreds of cases in some constituencies which have not been paid because of minor technicalities. The Minister can check that for himself.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies will be able to give the Minister graphic illustrations of instances where people have been disqualified on minute grounds. It is not good enough. The departmental task force will have to find a better solution. People are suffering enormous hardship due to bureaucratic bungling or ineptitude. I do not like to use injudicious language or to badger officials, but there is something grossly wrong. The Minister will appreciate that I am saying this in all sincerity. I am sure Deputy D'Arcy will enlarge on what I am saying. I expect some action to be taken to rectify this problem. Perhaps some of the local offices are not doing their job properly. Those cases should be attended to as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for <Col N="2223" /> allowing us to raise this matter. Unfortunately, this is an ongoing saga. A reply from the Minister for Agriculture in November 1991, in relation to the beef premium scheme said that having checked this with the appropriate section in the Department, the Department would, where mistakes were made without fraudulent intent and where there was reasonable explanation for such mistakes, make every effort to treat each case with flexibility and understanding because it appeared that some of the penalties laid down by the EC are too severe and that in fact, the Department had taken up this matter with the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give a couple of instances to the Minister of State on this issue. One has only to look at the Order Paper to realise the amount of time I and other rural TDs are spending on this matter. In one instance a man had 33 bullocks, one died and one disappeared. The man went down to the office in Enniscorthy to have his card stamped in relation to the 33 cattle. He pointed out to the official in the office that one had died and one had disappeared. The departmental inspector informed him that as a result of his failure to inform the Department he was being disqualified this year and next year. That was an unfair thing to do. A second farmer purchased eight cattle in the mart and he understood that they had not had the premium the previous year. The farmer checked the cards and they were all safe but he did not check the ears of the cattle. Unfortunately, two of the beasts were punched. The inspector called to his premises to inspect his herd. The farmer pointed out that two cattle were wrongly written up but he was disqualified for this year and next year. The problem is that the Department are using the criteria of two beasts in 40, or three beasts in 43 and if a farmer does not qualify under the criteria the farmer will not even be considered. This is most unfair. In County Wexford we have 170 <Col N="2224" /> cases still disqualified out of 2,600. These people are entitled to their money. The task force has not worked out a satisfactory result to this problem. As a rural Deputy I appeal to the Minister to do something about it.</P>

I will not abuse the two minutes available to me to trot out the statistics which were given to Deputy Deasy in reply to a Dáil question.</P>
      <P>As of now, the level of grant payments compared with last year and previous years exceed the statistics referred to in today's question. I acknowledge that difficulties are still being experienced by farmers in qualifying for these grants. As a result of the work of the task force we gave a commitment in this House that we would pay all grants which could be paid, particularly in cases of innocent error. The Department have been dealing with applications on that basis. As I said previously, we will again go back over the unsuccessful applications to see if grants can be paid. I acknowledge that today more than ever before farmers are becoming increasingly dependent on the payment of direct income supports from national Government and the EC. It is imperative that we put in place procedures which will enable payment of these grants to farmers in the year in which they are entitled to payment. The Department are determined to pay all grants where innocent error has been made in the application. That is the point which both Deputies raised this evening. I give them an assurance that we will continue to take steps to ensure that these grants will be paid if they meet requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regards to land annuities, the reason why the Land Commission were established was to make farms viable and to give farmers a chance to buy land in order to be viable. In recent years, with the downturn in agricultural activity and in farm incomes, farmers who are paying a very high rent for their land are finding it exceedingly difficult to make land annuity payments. This is causing anxiety and great hardship to many families throughout rural Ireland. The land annuity can take up the total profit of the holding in some instances.</P>
      <P>The Land Bond Bill recently introduced gave power to the Minister to reduce this burden. A working party were set up in the Department and I have heard nothing about the findings of that working party although I understand that discussions have been entered into by the Department of Agriculture and Food with the Department of Finance to see if a solution can be found to this problem. I am disappointed that the Government do not appear to be treating this matter with urgency in view of the fact that moneys in respect of premia due to farmers are being diverted to make some of the repayments in respect of land annuities to the Land Commission in Castlebar.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, who has many problems in his constituency in this respect, as has my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, will be able to clarify the position regarding this working party and whether a solution will be found and implemented as soon as possible to allay the fears of my constituents in Carlow-Kilkenny and among the people in Laois-Offaly.</P>

The first file I dealt with in my new position related to the problem of land annuities. As a result of a working party set up within the Department certain specific recommendations were made to my senior colleague, Deputy Walsh, and to me. We dealt with that file, which is now with the Department of Finance. There are certain very sizeable financial implications involved.</P>
      <P>I can assure both Deputies that I am extremely sympathetic to the problems of farmers in meeting their annuities. I want to assure that the annual repayments are within the capacity of each individual to meet them. In dealing with the file I took into consideration the recommendations of farming organisations and I had many discussions with individual farmers who have difficulties with repayments. I am taking every step open to me to dispose of this matter in the shortest time. I hope to see a reasonably satisfactory resolution of the problem within the next six to eight weeks. I do not want to be tied to that, but I give an assurance that the matter is being dealt with very seriously within the Department.</P>

      <P>I refer to the Nordex factory in Waterford city which went into receivership about five weeks ago with a loss of 30 jobs. The receiver was extremely hopeful at the outset that he could retain the enterprise as a going concern and I understand there were quite a number of inquiries, perhaps as many as 19, for the plant and equipment initially. I have now been informed that the receiver is to sell off the plant and the building separately. This gives rise to the fear that the enterprise will not continue as a going concern and that 30 jobs may well be lost. The fittings in question will all have to be imported in the future. It is widely believed that the person who <Col N="2227" /> owned the company has similar enterprises in Britain and will now merely export them into this country. I am asking that the enterprise be kept going, and that the 30 people should be kept in employment. I also ask that the cost of the imports from Britain be saved for an enterprise that can be conducted profitably.</P>

    <P>I understand from the IDA that they are engaged in serious negotiations with three interested parties and they are extremely optimistic that they will be able to find a buyer for Nordex. It is important that at a time of high unemployment public money is wisely spent. While the IDA will be supportive of any person or company interested in acquiring Nordex, viability must be taken into account. If it is possible for an interested party to <Col N="2228" /> acquire the company on the basis of business plans and future viability, the IDA will certainly be of assistance. I understand this evening from the IDA that they are extremely optimistic that they will be able to help a successful bidder and that the company will be back in production. This is a major Italian-based company which has plants in many parts of Europe. I do not know their intentions but the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I are anxious to ensure that the jobs will remain in Waterford. If viability can be assured, that will be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

      <P>The role of the examiner is based upon a number of models, including Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States, a number of European countries where debts are frozen while the financial position of a company is examined and also the role of the Administrator in the United Kingdom, which was introduced in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the 1990 amendment Bill into the Dáil in August 1990 he said that the effect of the Bill was to freeze payment to the creditors. However, the Bill does not freeze payment to existing creditors and there is nothing to prevent directors from paying existing creditors subject to whatever action the examiner might take to prevent them. The effect of the appointment of an examiner is that no proceedings for the winding up of the company may be commenced, a receiver cannot be appointed, no attachment, distress or execution can be put into force against the property or effects of the company except with the consent of the examiner. No action may be taken to realise any security which had been given by the company except with the consent of the examiner. No steps can be taken to repossess goods in the company's possession by any hire purchase agreement or leasing agreement. No proceedings of any sort can be commenced against any person who has guaranteed the debts of the company, and that of course would include <Col N="2229" /> the directors. Therefore, once an examiner has been appointed, there is no other legal action that the creditors can take.</P>
    <P>The recent liquidation of United Meat Packers is a perfect example where difficulties arose in respect of the payment for goods and services while the company was under the protection of a court-appointed examiner. It suited financial institutions to place the company in liquidation and therefore the banks refused to provide adequate additional capital to restructure the company. It is difficult to apportion blame to those banks in this instance in view of the fact that the company must be insolvent in the first instance to qualify for the examination procedure. No financial institution would be foolish enough to invest money in that type of scenario.</P>
    <P>The only way that finance could be provided was through the State rescue agency, Fóir Teoranta, which this Government abolished. I am calling on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to indicate if amendments can be made to the Companies Act to re-establish Fóir Teoranta or some venture capital State agency if he is serious about making the whole concept of examination work. Otherwise banks will starve companies of finance and bring about enforced liquidations under examination. It should never be tolerated again that a Minister should stand idly by and do nothing to ensure that goods and services are paid for by the Examiner when the company is under the protection of the court. That is what happened in this instance and it is unforgiveable. I would hope that the experience of UMP would give the Minister an opportunity to indicate amendments if necessary to the Companies Act.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for raising this matter. I am surprised that he has done so because he raised it by way of Dáil Question on 8 and 29 April and the Minister dealt adequately with the case made by him. The whole purpose of appointing Examiners is to allow companies <Col N="2230" /> in temporary financial difficulties to apply for the protection of the court for a period of three months.</P>
      <P>When the Examiner is appointed he acts as an investigator and reporter and looks at the possible viability and recovery of the company. This is a different process from either a receivership or a liquidation. The Examiner is appointed under the protection of the court for a temporary period of time so that he can ensure that in the longer term the company are viable. It would be wrong in those circumstances if the Examiner did not have full power to do what is necessary to make the company viable, which is the primary purpose of his or her appointment.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that difficulties in UMP arose after the Examiner was appointed. It is correct to say that the effect of appointing an Examiner is that all debts are frozen and only those debts incurred by the Examiner and those creditors who supplied goods at the request of the Examiner in order to keep the company in operation are given the protection of being paid first. They are guaranteed payment from the revenue of the company or from the disposal of assets and investments. The Examiner's expenses have first call on the revenue and the reason for this is that if a company were put into examinership and the expenses are not guaranteed, nobody would supply the essential raw materials to the company and the company would collapse.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to say that difficulties arose in UMP since the appointment of the Examiner. What happened was that an administrative error was made in the office of UMP and 200 different cheques, amounting to £234,000, which should have been paid were not included on the Examiner's list as a result of a clerical error and as a result they were not put before the court and included on the list of people to be paid. However, the matter was satisfactorily resolved and all 200 cheques were paid on 4 May 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2231" /> When Ministers are in difficulties, it is nice sometimes to give guarantees that legislation will be reviewed &mdash; of course, no legislation is written on stone and neither is this legislation. However, I see no reason to review the legislation at this stage as it has acted very effectively. Since we initiated the examinership procedure, just two years ago, 126 companies, many of them very low profile companies have availed of this provision of the Act and it has helped to save companies which would otherwise have gone under. Therefore I believe it is right that the Examiner's expenses and the creditors who supply goods to the Examiner should be treated as preferential creditors and should come before anything else that has a preferential debt or those who have secured or unsecured debt. If we did not have this provision there would be no point in appointing an Examiner.</P>
    <P>This legislation, the Companies <Col N="2232" /> (Amendment) Act, which brought in Part IX of the Companies Act, 1990, and the Companies Act itself will be constantly under review. If there is anything I can say about the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, it is that he is a reforming Minister who will do everything to support viable companies.</P>
    <P>I do not support the proposition of re-establishing Fóir Teoranta. We have to get it into our heads that we cannot throw taxpayers' good money after bad. We have to operate on the basis of commercial viability. If we do not do that we will have to have higher taxes, higher foreign debt, lower economic growth and higher unemployment. Although it is often popular to call for the establishment of new banks or new companies &mdash; at one stage there were calls to nationalise Bewley's, a bun shop &mdash; we have to be sensible and operate on the basis of commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 May 1992.</P>

      <P>On a general level, issues relating to the terms and conditions which will govern the next stage of EC Structural Funds are matters for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>However, in so far as public transport is concerned, the current Structural Fund regulations provide for a maximum aid rate of 75 per cent in the case of public expenditure; a maximum of 50 per cent applies to private sector expenditure. These maxima do not apply in all cases. The actual rates to apply to particular measures are negotiated with the EC Commission in the various operational programmes.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the detailed provisions of regulations to govern post 1993 Structural Funds have not yet commenced at Community level. In discussions on the general outline of the Commission's proposal commonly known as the Delors 2 package, Ireland has indicated that there should be wider application of the maximum aid rate in the next phase of the Structural Funds. Once the EC Commission brings forward draft regulations, Ireland will pursue this question formally in the context of the detailed discussions.</P>

      <P>There is already a number of important incentives, most notably by way of special tax reliefs, to facilitate the development of the Irish film industry. Film-making is taxed at a rate of 10 per cent as compared to the normal corporation tax of 40 per cent. Tax relief is also provided for corporate investment in film production under section 35 of the 1987 Finance Act. The maximum ceiling on relief was increased to £600,000 under section 28 of the 1989 Finance Act and the investment may be made either over three years in one or more projects or in a single film in one year. The time limit for the qualifying investments is being extended by this year's Finance Bill to end March, 1995. In addition, the business expansion scheme applies to film-making as it is classified as manufacturing and individual investors in film-making companies can get relief from full rates of income tax on dividends.</P>
      <P>The development of the Irish film production sector is also being aided by a number of State agencies, including RTE, the IDA, An Bord Tráchtála, the Arts Council. Údarás na Gaeltachta and FÁS.</P>
      <P>The provision of these various forms of assistance, coupled with the more professional and commercial approach adopted in recent years by Irish filmmakers, has facilitated a considerable expansion in the value of our audio-visual exports. The value of such exports is estimated by An Bord Tráchtála to have increased from £12 million in 1987 to £33 million in 1992.</P>
      <P>I understand that two studies of the Irish film production sector are at present nearing completion and I will ensure that the feasibility of their recommendations are examined carefully so as to consolidate the development of that industry.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, are being implemented on a phased basis. A number of the provisions were commenced on 1 December last. These include section 74 which imposes new legal controls on the sale of solvents to children.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to bring substantial elements of the Act into operation during the current year, including:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3 which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and empowers them to provide a comprehensive range of child care and family support services;</P>
      <P>Section 5 which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children;</P>
      <P>Section 6 which requires health boards to provide or ensure the provision of an adoption service in their area;</P>
      <P>Section 7 which requires each health board to establish a Child Care Advisory Committee to advise and assist it in the performance of its functions under the new legislation, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 and 10 which enable health boards to make arrangements <Col N="2108" /> with voluntary bodies to provide services on their behalf and to grant aid them for that purpose.</P>

    <P>The remaining provisions including those which require regulations, will be implemented on a phased basis over future years in accordance with the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
