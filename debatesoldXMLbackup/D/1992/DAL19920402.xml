      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A promise was made that a White Paper on European Union would be published early in the new year. The Taoiseach indicated that it would not be held up because of the separate but interlinked discussion on the Protocol. Would the Taoiseach accept that it is necessary as soon as possible to get a serious debate going on European Union?  Will he confirm that a White Paper will be published quickly and will not be further delayed because of the separate discussion on the Protocol?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will agree <Col N="334" /> that it is important that any amendment to the Protocol be well worded so that the wording does not in itself jeopardise the prospects of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is important for everybody to bear in mind.  The Programme for Government agreed between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats stated on page 17 that the Government agreed to the establishment of regional authorities by 31 March 1992. That date was two days ago.  Is it still the Government's intention to establish such authorities and has this matter been covered in the ongoing review of the Programme for Government which was agreed to take place every quarter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a bad memory.  Not too long ago in this House I clearly indicated that no legislation would be brought forward immediately to set up these new structures.  I said that discussions were continuing in relation to it but that the Deputy could take it that no legislation would be brought forward in this regard at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government indicated that legislation was not necessary and that it could be done under the Local Government Act, 1991.  I want to know if the order that was promised will be brought before the House under the existing legislation.  It does not require extra legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking a civilised question in relation to promised legislation. The Minister for Agriculture stated publicly on radio and television that he felt it was necessary to amend the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990. The Taoiseach told the ICMSA that there was an immediate need to amend that Act.  In view of the fact that the Act has failed to protect and honour cheques worth £2.25 million owed to 600 farmers, when is it proposed to amend the Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>About a month ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that as a result of a court case it was his intention to bring forward a court case to amend the Companies Act.  Will that legislation include the point raised by Deputy Deasy and by Deputy Higgins?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated quite clearly in this House that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is having meetings with the farm organisations in relation to their complaints regarding the specific questions raised by Deputy Deasy.  No legislation is promised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the uncertainty surrounding the Maastricht debate, will the Taoiseach indicate his intentions with regard to the timetable for the introduction of legislation to give effect to the necessary referendum procedures?  Does he still intend it to be before June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see the debate between the political parties on this question being brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.  I expect the Fine Gael Leader to be in touch with me some time today, if I am to believe in what I hear.  I will then try again to arrange a meeting of all the political leaders tomorrow.  The Leader of Fine Gael needs time, as he quite clearly stated, to consider the matter before he will be in a position to attend any meeting or to come forward.  When he has concluded his deliberations, perhaps today or tomorrow &mdash; it is a matter for himself &mdash; I will attempt to arrange the meeting I have promised by tomorrow afternoon, if that is acceptable to all the leaders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to find the simple truth of the matter.  The Taoiseach has made a statement indicating somewhat obliquely that the Companies Act will be amended.  Will he tell us in plain language what he means by that statement? Does it mean that the 1990 Act will be amended?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my remarks then to section 98.  This section provides that the Minister may make an order whereby any of the provisions of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, shall apply to the agency.  I would like the Minister to explain the <i>rationale</i> for this move.  On previous sections we debated the extent to which powers are being transferred from local authorities to the agency and it appears that this is happening here again.</P>
      <P>I would like to know whether this measure will apply to the more recent Water Pollution Act as well as to the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  Under those Acts local authorities have power to make water quality management plans and to prohibit certain activities within the areas of rivers or lakes, agricultural activities and so on.  In that sense local authorities have a certain degree of power and control over their own area. However, I am concerned about the proposals in this Bill to transfer that power from local authorities to the agency.  As well as undermining local authorities as organisations and institutions it will also undermine the principle of local democracy. The people elected at local level to local authorities should have power to make water quality management plans. For example, if they find that a river or lake is in danger of pollution they could prescribe certain activities.  I would like the Minister to explain the reason for the transfer of that power to the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 98 is indicative of the general thrust of the Bill, with which I disagree, that is to divest local authorities of some of their remaining roles.  It certainly runs counter to the provisions in the Local Government Reform Act of last year.  We argued this matter earlier in this debate in relation to <Col N="340" /> the licensing role.  I argued very strongly that local authorities, in the first instance, should be responsible for licensing.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore that we are undermining and eroding local democracy.  We should ensure that every local authority operate as an active determined agent for the environment.  The more we centralise powers the more we clog up the entire system.  This applies not only to local government law but to almost every aspect of law.  I would ask the Minister to consider amending this section on Report Stage to ensure that prime responsibility for implementing the Water Pollution Act remains with local authorities except in exceptional circumstances. I suggest that responsibility be transferred to the agency from a specific local authority not as a general practice but only if that local authority are not doing their job.  The thrust of the Bill should be recast in order to make it clear that not only is there a national Environmental Protection Agency but that every local authority be considered as a local environmental protection agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in general with Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Gilmore in that the local authority should have prime responsibility for pollution problems in their own area.  I am a member of a local authority who are starved of money and have no hope of raising additional funds. That local authority have to implement pollution laws in spite of the cutbacks they have endured over the last four or five years.  Unless the Government in the future increase the financing of local authorities these authorities will be unable to carry out their work.  If they were properly financed they would be able to carry out the work that is proposed to be done by this agency. However, if the Minister does not make provision in the near future to ensure that local authorities are properly funded it is appropriate that some responsibility be transferred to the agency.  I hope that sufficient funds will be provided for this purpose, but I do not envisage that happening. If every other local authority are as starved of cash as are the local authority <Col N="341" /> in my area I doubt if they will be able to implement the pollution laws.  At present there are pollution problems that could be solved by local authorities but without the manpower and the finance they cannot do so.  Until there is proper reorganisation of local government this section will have to be accepted, but only for that reason.</P>

      <P>It seems that we are having a rehash of yesterday's debate on the question of subsidiarity.  It appears to me that the Minister's opponents, Deputies Gilmore and Mitchell, have not made their case any more than it was made yesterday.  Commonsense indicates that when we are talking about the possible pollution of rivers, for example, we must remember that many of our rivers flow through as many as five or six counties.  We have to guard against the possibility of one local authority breaking their back trying to get a river clean and then finding that a local authority above them do not have the resources or knowhow to clean up that river nor an interest in it.  Certain decisions have to be made nationally.  As I said yesterday, the Green Party are convinced of the need for subsidiarity. Decisions should be made at the lowest effective level.  In many cases, unfortunately, that means national level. I support the general thrust of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the debate on this issue.  Perhaps there has been some misunderstanding. It is expected that, generally speaking, the powers to be transferred will be powers given to the agency and the local authorities rather than powers taken from local authorities and given exclusively to the agency.  That action is necessary because of the agency's licensing role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, under legislation relating to air pollution and particularly water pollution, a local authority is able to serve a section 12 notice outlining action that needs to be taken to prevent <Col N="342" /> pollution.  I wish to extend that power to the agency in relation to activities in which they are involved.  If an incident of pollution occurs a local authority is able to take action to abate or prevent pollution and reclaim the cost afterwards by simple contract debt.  The authority is able to seek information, maps and drawings in relation to discharges to water and so on.  I simply wish to give those powers to the agency also.  If the agency are to license activities that can discharge into waters then it will obviously be necessary for the agency to have those powers.  It is also desirable that the agency should have emergency powers to be able to take a case to the High Court in an emergency. Those powers are given to local authorities under the water pollution legislation.</P>
    <P>In addition to giving powers to the agency to enable them to do their work in relation to activities that they can license, it may also be that it is desirable to transfer powers because powers are not being exercised.  Deputy Gilmore referred to the making of by-laws.  To the best of my knowledge no local authority has yet initiated the making of by-laws &mdash; certainly, no by-law has been presented for confirmation to me &mdash; yet the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act has been in place for two years.  In the event of serious problems in certain areas and inaction on the part of a local authority, for whatever reason, it may be desirable to transfer power to the agency.  If we did not give the agency that power then we would have an agency which had power in theory but would have their hands tied when it came to real and practical action.  This measure is designed to provide for the best of all worlds.</P>
    <P>In making regulations under these sections it is not my intention to transfer powers to the agency for the sake of it.  I, too, share Deputies concern and interest in keeping as many powers as possible with local authorities.  I fully subscribe to the subsidiarity rule, which means that matters should be dealt with at the lowest common level in accordance with whatever is efficient and effective. <Col N="343" /> It is obvious that everything cannot be done efficiently and effectively at a very local level.</P>
    <P>In order to make the work of the agency effective, particularly in relation to their own licensing role, and to give them the same powers enjoyed by local authorities the provision of this measure is necessary.  In so far as local authorities will keep most licensing functions under their control, local authorities will continue to exercise those powers.  Certainly when the agency are the licensing authority they should have the same powers as given to local authorities under water pollution and air pollution legislation in order to deal with problems, to make good damage and to get maps and information to serve section 12 notices and so forth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues at stake in this debate.  One is the principle of subsidiarity, referred to by Deputy Garland.  It seems to me that Deputy Garland is having some difficulty in understanding this issue.  One cannot on the one hand say that decisions should be made at the lowest possible level and then on the other hand provide in legislation to have those functions transferred to a central agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue is the question of effectiveness.  Presumably, the whole purpose of the Bill is to provide a more effective vehicle for the protection of the environment.  Frankly, it is my view that what we are providing for in the Bill is a mush.  Nobody will know precisely who is responsible for what.  Deputy Kavanagh has already said that local authorities do not now have the resources to do the job they have been given.  In recent years legislation has provided local authorities with additional functions, but because their staff numbers and resources are reducing they simply have not been in a position to carry out those functions.  On top of that, some functions will be transferred &mdash; not completely perhaps, but as an alternative &mdash; to the Environmental Protection Agency.  When an incident of water pollution occurs who will be <Col N="344" /> responsible?  In practice it may be that the local authority involved will say that the incident is the responsibility of the agency, the agency will say that it is the responsibility of the local authority and someone else will say that it is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has just used the example of the making of by-laws in relation to water pollution.  It is my understanding that the Minister has the power to direct a local authority to make by-laws.  If a problem arose in connection with a particular river and the local authority involved said that they did not have the resources to take the necessary actions, that at any rate the Minister had by order transferred those functions partially to the agency, and the Environmental Protection Agency said that the problem was still the responsibility of the local authority, the Minister for the Environment is able to give directions.  The problem is that many people will have responsibility for incidents that might occur yet none of them will have the resources or the wherewithal to deal with them, so action simply will not be taken.  One authority will pass the buck to another.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to have a clear definition that local authorities are responsible at ground level for the protection of the environment and for the implementation of legislation relating to water pollution, air pollution or whatever. If there was a problem of resources, which there is, it would be better to provide that the role of the Environmental Protection Agency was to back up the local authorities.  For example, if it is that local authorities are not making by-laws in relation to water or air because they do not have the staff or resources to do that, then it would be simpler to give the agency the role of promoting standard by-laws and providing technical and resource backup to local authorities to enable the authorities to do the job.  To take the functions away from the local authorities or, worse still, to create an ambiguity whereby both the agency and local authorities will have the same functions and the result is that no one takes <Col N="345" /> responsibility for action is the wrong approach.  What the Minister is doing here is creating an ambiguity.  I remember when the Dublin Transport Authority were established, when one could not even ask to have yellow lines marked on a road without the matter having to be referred to them.  On issues relating to water or air pollution arising on a day to day basis in local authorities, if the provisions of these sections are implemented and if the Minister transfers functions, the standard answer members of local authorities will get from their county or city managers will be: these functions have been transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency; it is now their responsibility and anyway this local authority do not have the resources to do it.  With this formula I predict we will end up in a position even worse than that obtaining, because nobody will carry the can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly along the lines Deputy Gilmore has just been expressing.  The more we debate this Bill the more I realise the Minister may be making a very grave mistake, which in reality could harm the environment. I am absolutely astonished at Deputy Garland's contention that because rivers flow through more than one county there must be some super body, not local authorities, responsible for them.  For example, the elimination of water pollution from the River Liffey was achieved by Dublin Corporation.  We all remember when the River Liffey stank, when some days it was almost like an open sewer, when the smell prevailed frequently.  That has been eliminated because of action taken by Dublin Corporation by the provision of new drainage systems and other water pollution preventive measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were we to follow Deputy Garland's arguments to their logical conclusion there would have to be a super Government for Europe.  For example, what about the Danube, the Rhine, rivers flowing through many countries never mind counties?  I contend Deputy Garland is making a grave mistake, one that <Col N="346" /> often happens, in that those who parade themselves as great environmentalists often in their zeal damage the environment. Here is a case in point.  We must impress on local authorities that theirs is the primary role in protecting the environment, whether it be water, air, landscape, the visual environment or whatever.  I contend that the type of provision included in this section will be a cop-out for local authorities in that they will be able to advance the double excuse of (a) lack of resources and (b) it is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency anyway.  From my experience in this House I am deeply apprehensive about anything that is centralised.  That applies right through legislation when decisions are taken at national level without regard to local factors or local knowledge. I see this as relevant in many areas, but particularly in relation to the environment.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised to hear the Minister say that no local authority had made any by-laws in relation to water under the relevant legislation.  What has the Minister done about that?  What pressure has she brought to bear on local authorities to produce such by-laws?  If she has not brought any pressure to bear on them, has she not been negligent in her duty?  If she really sees herself as Minister of State responsible for the protection of the environment, what has she been doing to improve the quality of water and to ensure that local authorities do their job?</P>
    <P>I perceive the role of the Environmental Protection Agency as being, in the first place, to ensure that local authorities do their job whether it be in relation to water, air pollution or any other aspect of environmental protection. If they do not do their job then there should be power reserved for the Environmental Protection Agency to take over that task and push aside any local authority who have been remiss in their duties.  But there is a real danger, under the type of provision in this section, that the environment will fall between two stools.</P>
    <P>I revert to the matter of control of <Col N="347" /> water pollution at county level, it being contended that control at county level is impossible because rivers flow through more than one county.  For example, air passes through all counties.  Is one to contend therefore that local authorities should have no function in relation to the control of air pollution?  That is absurd and nonsensical.  We must remember that the environment has the greatest impact on people themselves, that what goes wrong most frequently is at local level and should be controlled at local level. Conversely, opinion in favour of the environment should be mobilised on the ground to suit local factors at local level. I contend this type of provision compounds the error in the earlier parts of the Bill concerning licensing.</P>

      <P>First, may I assure my Dublin colleagues that when the River Liffey leaves Wicklow it is in pristine condition.  I hope they will look after it, as we do in Wicklow.  Of course, it also flows into County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister allows an option between the new agency and local authorities, I predict that whenever there is a cost involved, the relevant county manager will instruct his county councillors that this matter should be pushed on to the agency.  There will be no doubt about that.  This is the fault I perceive in this section, in addition to the points I made earlier.  If the provisions of this Bill mean that local authorities can renege on their responsibilities under this section, pushing them over to the new agency, that will be done.  In one way the provisions of this section, consitute a belt and braces job in that a local authority can attend to problems, but if they fail the agency can be asked to undertake the relevant task. In such circumstances I predict the agency will be asked to assume responsibility, whereas that should be the task of the local authority.  That will arise because when estimates time comes around a county manager will say; we can save money in this area because the agency have ultimate responsibility.  That <Col N="348" /> is a problem that will be created by the provisions of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is turning into an attack on the Green Party position on decentralisation.  I am amazed at Deputy Gilmore; he must not listen to what I say.  Of course, we can do everything at the lowest possible level; that is a recipe for anarchism.  Deputy Jim Mitchell appears to have outflanked me in this area.  The Green Party always prided themselves on having an anarchistic streak, but it appears that Fine Gael have now joined the club.  I am sorry Deputy Mitchell has left and is not here to listen to this.  I will have to speak to him afterwards.</P>
      <P>The key word here is &ldquo;effective&rdquo;.  I think the Minister used that word as well, although she did refer to the &ldquo;common level&rdquo;.  The key phrase is &ldquo;effective level&rdquo;.  We are all here, I hope, in an endeavour to improve our environment, to find the most effective way to do so through the provisions of this Bill.  In so deciding we must examine the various bodies responsible for enforcing, monitoring and licensing.</P>
      <P>While the Bill has many defects, its structure is very good.  In so far as the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in this section, it gives a certain degree of flexibility &mdash; another matter about which we must be careful.  While we must endeavour to render all legislation as specific as possible, there has to be a degree of flexibility in this case to allow the agency decide what they and, in turn, what a local authority will do.  Of course local authorities will play an extremely important role in the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  It is essential that their efforts are not devalued in any way and that they do not adopt the attitude: &ldquo;Ah, well, the agency will look after this&rdquo;, because that will not do at all and, hopefully, will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might revert to some of Deputy Jim Mitchell's remarks, which I can only describe as bizarre.  In fact he made my case when he spoke about even the air we breathe not respecting county boundaries. That is the very point I am making <Col N="349" />&mdash; all decisions should be made at local level.  Yesterday Deputy Howlin referred to the plans which had been submitted by the ESB to Wexford County Council for building a nuclear power plant at Carnsore Point.  Deputy Gilmore and the Fine Gael Party seem to think that that decision should be made solely by Wexford County Council.  This is arrant nonsense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin also referred to the centralisation of power in Europe.  My party are very opposed to centralisation in Europe of decision-making powers on issues which could be decided here by us. It is for that reason that we opposed the Single European Act and are opposing the Maastricht Treaty.  Are Fine Gael saying that there should be no more international treaties similar to MARPOL, which deals with sea pollution, and that we should all do our own thing?  That is clearly nonsensical.  I want to repeat that decisions have to be made at the lowest effective level whether it is at parish, community, county, regional, national, continental or global level.  That is what I am saying.  This is a very good debate because it raises the question of where decisions should be made, an issue which should be debated much more in the House.</P>

      <P>As we get into the meat of the Bill I become more surprised at the contributions being made.  It seems that some Deputies want an advisory and consultative Environmental Protection Agency.  When I try to give the agency real teeth so that they can carry out their work there seems to be substantial opposition from some Deputies.</P>
      <P>I wish first to respond to the points made by Deputy Mitchell.  I am sorry he is not present in the House, but I understand he will be back later.  He seemed to take credit for the condition of the Liffey.  Yet on Second Stage Deputy Dukes chastised me about the state of the Liffey.  He referred to the pollution in the river at Kilcullen and said this was causing enormous problems in the river all the way into Dublin.  We need to be clear on what we are talking about here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> I am not suggesting that we willy-nilly take powers away from local authorities and hand them over to the agency.  I could not support such a proposal.  I am saying that the agency should have the same powers in relation to the activities they will license, as a local authority have &mdash; for example, to seek a High Court injunction to serve a section 12 notice and to specify what work should be done to prevent pollution.  There will be no confusion.  It will be made clear in the regulations to be made under this section that the agency will have the same powers in relation to the activities they license as a local authority have in relation to the activities that they will continue to license.  We are talking about the activities in the First Schedule.  It is important that the national Environmental Protection Agency, an independent environmental police force, should not in any way be hamstrung by a lack of power to act in certain circumstances.  It may well be desirable in the interests of preventing pollution and ensuring that the appropriate controls are put in place to give the agency specific powers under either the Water Pollution Act or the Air Pollution Act.  Certain powers will have to be transferred to the agency.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies seem to hold the view that if a local authority do not act it is simply due to a lack of resources.  I cannot accept that point of view.  I accept that local authorities have had to work under the strain of financial difficulties over the past number of years.  I fully accept that they have a problem with resources. However, I cannot accept that only a lack of resources has resulted in many things which should have been done not being done.  Sometimes things are not done because of a lack of will and the need to realign priorities.  There are 30,000 local authority workers and officials in the country.  That is a substantial number of people for the size of the country.  There are about 10,000 local authority personnel employed in the Dublin city and county and Dún Laoghaire areas.  This is a large number of people.  I cannot accept that things are not done because of a lack of personnel or resources.  Sometimes it <Col N="351" /> is a question of reassigning people to different jobs when priorities change, and priorities have changed enormously over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>If the agency are to have teeth it is essential that they have these powers. They need these powers if they are to put into effect the licensing powers they are being given under Part IV of the Bill.  If somebody does not comply with a licensing condition the agency should be able to get a High Court injunction.  I do not think anyone could justifiably argue that the agency should not be in a position to get a High Court injunction in such circumstances.  Is it being suggested that the agency should not be able to serve a section 12 notice in relation to a particular activity and that they should not be able to get information in the same way as local authority can from a licensee in regard to maps, detailed drawings etc? These are the kind of powers I am talking about.  There is no point misrepresenting what is in the legislation.  It is not my intention to create confusion.  It will be made quite clear in the regulations that in the main local authorities will be the people responsible on the ground for environmental protection.  The agency will be given very specific functions.  They will have a licensing role in relation to all the activities set out in the First Schedule and for the established activities which will be transferred to them over a period of time.  The agency will be given the same powers in relation to those activities as local authorities have in relation to the activities they license.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that it is not my intention to have the agency operating totally separate from the local authorities. I see the agency and the local authorities working very much hand in glove, they will fit in together and complement each other to a large extent.  The agency are being given very specific powers to advise, help and assist local authorities in the carrying out of their duties.  I know that many local authorities very often cannot enforce some of the environmental protection measures which are required of them because they <Col N="352" /> may not have the particular expertise required.  Such local authorities need help from a body who will have the necessary resources, expertise, equipment, etc.  They need help from a body who are organised on a national basis.</P>
    <P>In some cases local authorities need to reconsider their priorities.  Deputy Mitchell asked what I had done about local authorities who had not initiated by-laws. There seems to be a contradiction in Deputy Mitchell's attitude.  In the first instance he thinks that the agency and Minister should not have power over local authorities, that there should be a totally separate local authority structure which virtually operates on its own.  Yet when there is a problem he thinks that the Minister should intervene.  When the agency are in place no doubt he will believe that they should intervene.  If particular pollution problems arise when the agency are in place and they do not have the power to act or fail to act, I have no doubt that Deputy Mitchell and people like him will be the first to say &ldquo;We thought this agency were going to solve all the problems.  Why do they not have the power to deal with this problem or, if they have the power, why are they not taking action?&rdquo; We cannot have it every way.  We all know that the present organisational system is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>With regard to the making of by-laws, my Department have asked local authorities to initiate the making of by-laws where they are essential.  This was done shortly after the publication of the Bill.  I believe that in some cases &mdash; I will pursue this matter personally as I have done in the case of some members of local authorities and county managers &mdash; the making of by-laws will be essential if we are to control and regulate agricultural activities in particular regions so that water resources do not become a source of pollution and there is no recurrence of the problems which arose in the past in relation to, for example, Lough Sheelin.  When a water resource of that kind is polluted and destroyed it takes years of work and much money to restore it &mdash; sometimes this may not be possible &mdash; to its original quality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> I accept Deputy Gilmore's desire not to have confusion so that when a problem arises the buck cannot be passed by a local authority who may opt out by saying &ldquo;We will stand back because this is a matter for the agency&rdquo;.  It will be made clear in the regulations who has responsibility for what.  The local authorities will have responsibility for virtually everything except the activities licensed by the agency.  This will remain the position unless an emergency arises and particular power has to be transferred.  It is not my intention to create confusion.  On the contrary, it is the intention to streamline and improve the organisational way we deal with environmental protection. Because of our size, the dispersement of our population and our low level of industrial development, we need a national central body organised on a local and regional basis but, nonetheless, a central body with the expertise and resources to do the kind of difficult job now required if environmental pollution is to be prevented.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsidiarity &mdash; to some extent it does not relate to the issue and I would prefer to concentrate on the Bill &mdash; we all wish that every family on a street could decide everything that happened in it and that every community could be the sole decision-making body in relation to what happened in it but we all know that would not be possible, we must be practical.  We have the lowest density of population in Western Europe &mdash; I think it is 55 people per square kilometre &mdash; and it is not possible to devolve to very low levels, decisions of this kind because it would not be efficient or practical, it would be extremely costly, cumbersome and bureaucratic.</P>
    <P>I know that we are debating section 98 but Deputy Gilmore referred to three sections.  He is right because, to some extent, they are similar.  However, in relation to the making of air or water quality management plans, a specific function of a local authority at the moment, these powers will only be transferred with the positive approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas which gives a guarantee that it is not the intention, <Col N="354" /> under the provision of these three sections of the Bill, to lightly transfer powers if they have been exercised in a satisfactory way or unless it is necessary to do so for the efficient operation of this agency in their licensing role to have such powers.</P>

      <P>I am slightly at a disadvantage because this is the first time I have been in the House to hear the debate on this Bill.  I do not really know what it intends to do but I am a little cynical in regard to the creation of an Environmental Protection Agency because I see it as another layer of bureaucracy.  However, I am not cynical about the Minister's commitment to the environment which is almost on a par with that of the Green Party.  The Minister strongly defended the Bill and what she intends to do.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we could have done without this agency and instead forced local authorities to act in a more responsible manner.  Our waterways have been neglected because they have a low priority. The Minister is right in stating that local authorities have neglected this area but their neglect has been because they have been starved of money and because so many other priorities take precedence over waterways.  If the Minister wants to implement the provisions in this Bill she should call in every county manager in the country and tell them of the need to enforce the regulations in regard to the maintenance of waterways and rivers. She would also need to have discussions with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell said that the River Liffey is now free of pollution; there are rivers in every county which have probably been neglected since the foundation of the State.  More money should be made available to local authorities to enable them to do this work. The Minister spoke about enforcing laws and bringing people to court.  The people who will be brought to court more frequently will be local authorities and unless they are provided with more money there will be no improvement, despite the creation of this agency.  Perhaps <Col N="355" /> the Minister has already announced what funds she will make available to local authorities, I do not know.  There is no point either in prosecuting private bodies if the local authorities &mdash; the chief polluters of the rivers &mdash; are left alone. Unless the Minister gets a commitment from the county managers that they will enforce by-laws, the work will not be done.</P>

      <P>When I spoke initially I simply wanted to find out the Minister's <i>rationale</i> for these sections and to draw attention to practical difficulties in regard to them.  I do not have any problem with the Environmental Protection Agency having the powers to serve notices, take people to court and so on, which the Minister indicated will be contained in the regulations.  However, it is a pity she did not state that clearly in the Bill, which would have avoided the kind of ambiguity we now have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate we have been trying to mobilise local communities and local authorities in a collective effort to protect the environment.  The Environmental Protection Agency were to put in place, as I understand it, a national specialised agency which would have overall and specific responsibilities for the protection of the environment.  Perhaps the Minister will take account of this when she is drawing up the regulations; any citizen who has had the experience of ringing a local authority with a complaint in relation to sewage, water, roads or footpaths knows that he or she will be subjected to a &ldquo;pass the buck&rdquo; syndrome.  A person who telephones is told that the matter is the responsibility of another body.  My concern is that if an individual citizen sees a diesel slick or something of that nature in a river and telephones the local authority he or she will be told it is an industrial matter which must be the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency.  If the Minister creates ambiguity in the regulations and ends up with more than one body having responsibility for a particular function, there is a risk of the buck being passed <Col N="356" /> and the public will end up by feeling frustrated and suffering as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We now come to amendment No. 258a in the name of Deputy Garland.  Amendment No. 258b is related and, accordingly, amendments Nos. 258a and 258b will be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 258a:</P>
      <P>In page 74, subsection (1), lines 32 and 33, to delete &ldquo;may, at any time, and shall when requested by the Minister to do so,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with emission limit values and quality standards.  It is a very important section.</P>
      <P>The Agency may, at any time, and shall when requested by the Minister to do so, make recommendations to the Minister in relation to&mdash;</P>
      <P>It then lists the various Acts that have to be complied with.  In my amendment, I seek to get to the core of the agency's functions.  I expect the agency will have a great deal to say about emission limit values and quality standards.  I suspect that the words &ldquo;may at any time, and shall when requested by the Minister to do so,&rdquo; is just civil servicese.  Hopefully the agency will do this all the time but, so that it can be made absolutely clear to the agency what their duties are, it would be better if the subsection stated that the agency shall make recommendations to the Minister in relation to air quality standards under the Air Pollution Act, 1987; emission limit values under the Air Pollution Act, 1987 and quality standards for waters, trade effluents and so on under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment which clarifies beyond any <Col N="357" /> doubt the work the agency should be doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the Deputy's views on some sections it is acknowledged that extensive powers are being given to this agency in respect of a host of matters.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was used because I was keen to ensure the agency would have some flexibility in relation to those issues we believe they are the best body to decide.  If we use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; it compels the agency to prepare emission limit values and quality standards even if this is not necessary. The Deputy's amendment does not make it clear the basis or frequency of the emission limit values and quality standards.  If we use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the agency may on a once off basis make recommendations, but that would be the end of it.</P>
      <P>It is better to leave this matter to the discretion of the agency so that they can as they see fit make recommendations in relation to emission limit values and quality standards but, obviously, they will have to do so if they are so requested by the Minister.  The reason the power has been given to the Minister to request the agency to make recommendations on these matters is that it would relate to something the Minister wished to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting of standards, whether for a sewage treatment plant or anything else is a political decision at the end of the day and is not a matter for an independent body.  It is for the Minister of the day to decide the level of and to what the standards apply.  It is desirable that the Minister consult with the agency and consider their recommendations because they have the expertise but at the end of the day putting the standard in place involves the expenditure of money. Whether we decide to have a teritary or secondary sewage treatment is a political decision and is not one that can be made by a body removed from the political arena, much as many people would like to give an independent body rather than a political body such powers.  These powers are vested in Ministers and Governments <Col N="358" /> because political decisions have to be made.</P>
    <P>I am not keen to give a mandatory power to the agency when I do not believe it is necessary.  If we give the agency unnecessary mandatory powers the agency will be forced to do things for the sake of doing them and this will not allow them to organise their priorities. Given that they will be an independent body with the support of a very comprehensive advisory committee representative of environmental organisations I believe the board of the agency, together with their advisory committee, are the best people to decide on the exercise of their duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak on his section but, when the Minister said she has responsibilities in his area, I felt I should inquire whether there is a responsibility on the Minister to implement the relevant EC directives. When I was Minister for the Environment long outfalls into the sea were allowed in certain areas but that has been changed by an EC directive.  I would have thought the Minister would have to insist on those changes being made rather than she having any discretion in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is both yes and no.  Of course, the Minister is obliged to comply with EC directives but the EC set the minimum standard.  It may well be a political decision will be taken to go beyond the EC directive in relation to certain standards.  If there are no European directives in relation to standards, any Minister has to be free to introduce them if it is felt necessary and desirable. In doing so the Minister would take the advise and consider the recommendations of the agency.  Deputy Kavanagh is right that we are obliged to put into place the directive on municipal waste which took effect last March.  Member states have a number of years to put that directive into effect.  Effectively this means that in large coastal towns with a population equivalent of 10,000, we cannot dispose of raw sewage into the sea and in certain more sensitive areas further treatment <Col N="359" /> will be required.  Obviously it is the intention to comply with such directives and put in place the facilities required to ensure that our seas and water resources do not become polluted as a result of inappropriate sewage disposal.  In addition a Minister may go beyond EC directives in introducing standards. Although it is expensive and difficult to comply with EC directives due to our limited resources, in many instances we must view them as the minimum and seek to go beyond them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I omitted to refer to amendment No. 258b.  I do not understand why it is being taken with amendment No. 258a because they do not seen to be connected.  Amendment No. 258b deals with subsection (2) which states:</P>
      <P>Before making regulations for any of the purposes referred to in subsection (1) the Minister shall have regard to any relevant recommendations made by the Agency pursuant to that subsection.</P>
      <P>I am seeking to delete the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; because in my view all recommendations by the agency would be relevant.  It is hard to understand why the agency would recommend measures that are irrelevant.  This seems to be an extraordinary provision and I would like the Minister to explain what purpose the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; serves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the Minister's reply to amendment No. 258a, I am not convinced by her reply.  Perhaps, rather than looking at the alternative words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; we should concentrate on the words, &ldquo;when requested by the Minister to do so&rdquo; which I sought to delete.  My concern is that, as soon as the agency is established a request could come from the Minister to do something, which they do, and before they have time to draw their breath they get another request from the Minister to do something else. Thus the agency could get to a stage where they would say, we will wait until the Minister tells us to do something.  I know there is a temptation to interfere <Col N="360" /> and that the lines of communication will be difficult from time to time.  The Minister could be sitting in her office fuming and asking what the agency are doing &mdash; that is if my amendment is accepted &mdash; because they are required to make recommendations and they are not doing anything about them.  That is all very well but I can see a situation where the agency could become totally dependent and not do anything until such time as the Minister asks them.  The agency are prime movers and substantial and wide-ranging tasks are being given to them.  Highly qualified staff are being employed at enormous expense &mdash; justifiably, I am sure &mdash; to the taxpayer and they should have the initiative to get on with the job. If the Minister has to ask the agency to do something unless it is something totally unreasonable, then the agency are not fulfilling their job and the director general and the directors of the agency should be removed and a new director general and new directors should be appointed.  That could be a great copout, to use Deputy Mitchells expression, and a great excuse for lethargy and inaction by the agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to accept amendment No. 258b in the name of Deputy Garland.  In regard to the Deputy's further comments on mandatory requirements I should say that in relation to standards generally this country, because of our resource problem, particularly in relation to sewage treatment, will find it enormously difficult to meet the European requirements demanded of us.  We would be doing well by the end of the decade to have implemented the very imaginative and comprehensive environmental action plan to which the Government have committed themselves and which will take a considerable amount of resources &mdash; higher than many of us might have imagined &mdash; for the provision of certain facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it is desirable when we have an environmental protection agency, which is effectively an environmental police force, that they should have the option of being able to make <Col N="361" /> recommendations in relation to certain standards.  I am opposed to giving them the mandatory power to do so.  As I said earlier the power to implement standards, at whatever level, is a political decision and one that is made on the basis of the need, as perceived by the Government of the day and on the basis of the resources available to the Government of the day.  It is very much a political decision.  Politicians are answerable for what they do or do not do.</P>
    <P>Giving the agency the mandatory power does not mean anything else happens. It would be satisfactory if the agency, on a once off basis, made recommendations in relation to emission standards. They are not required to do so every year or every two years or to revise them.  If a body with comprehensive powers are given some mandatory powers, which they can choose to exercise whenever they wish, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not mean they have to do it immediately or that they must do it on a regular basis.  If we leave it &ldquo;may&rdquo; they could choose, on a frequent basis, to specify limits under subsection (1) (a) of that section; or they might choose to do so on a less frequent basis in relation to paragraph (b) or they might choose frequently to make recommendations in relation to paragraph (c) because they perceive a particular need.</P>
    <P>We have got to have faith and trust in this agency and I have said that on many occasions during the debate on this Bill. I am aware that to some extent we are putting faith in people we have not yet seen.  I am satisfied that the procedures in place for the selection of the chairman, the director general and the board of directors are such that we will have outstandingly well qualified, suitable people as director general and directors of this agency.  We must give them some flexibility; we must place some trust in them and give them the option to do things as they think necessary.  The standards will not become effective until they are introduced by a Minister of the Government. Therefore, it is desirable when introducing such standards that the Minister for the Environment would consult with <Col N="362" /> and have the recommendations and advice of the agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister of State has made what may well turn out to be one of the most interesting and historic contributions of this entire debate, particularly in her remarks relating to the environment action plan.  I have heard the Minister of State acknowledge that the Government will not meet the target set down in the environment action plan.  There are three phrases that stick in my memory from her contribution: first, she described it as an imaginative plan, which suggests to me that it is something more surreal than real; second, she said we would be very lucky if we achieve the objectives set down in the environment action plan; and, third, there was a passing reference to resources.  Every time I hear a Government Minister making a reference to resources it means something will not be done, it is in some way qualified.</P>
      <P>For the first time since the environment action plan was launched in early 1990 we have, at long last, got an acknowledgment of what many of us suspected, that the environment action plan was, indeed, a figment of somebody's imagination, that it will not be implemented, that the targets set down in it will not be achieved. We already know that the legislative targets set down in it, including the legislation before us, are already way behind time.  We have now got an acknowledgement for the first time that the targets which were set down in the environment action plan regarding the treatment of sewage and other areas, all of which were laudatory, and which all Members of this House would support, will not be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall distinctly the launching of the £1,000 million plan to save the environment, at the beginning of the Green Presidency.  It was hailed uncritically.  On that occasion the media, in my opinion, did not give the kind of critical examination that was required of that plan at the time.  I do not know whether it had to do with the way in which press relations were handled at the time of <Col N="363" /> Ireland's Presidency of the EC &mdash; but I recall very disinctly on our national broadcasting services that the critical comments made about the environment action plan were not even covered at that time.  Over two years later we have got a Government Minister who, albeit in a qualified and reserved way, is now acknowledging that the environment action plan was no more than a glossy PR booklet for the Green Presidency and that the targets set down in it will not be achieved.  I thank the Minister of State for being honest and for putting that on the record; it should not be passed over as it is a historic acknowledgment that the environment action plan is beginning to run its course.</P>

      <P>As we near the end of the debate on Committee Stage the realm of politics is becoming more apparent. Deputy Gilmore knows perfectly well that I did not say that the action plan would not be implemented.  I repeat that we will be put to the pin of our collars in meeting the imaginative and brave commitments made in the plan.  A commitment has been given that by the year 2,000 we will have put to an end the continuing disposal of sewage into our inland waters and that appropriate sewage treatment facilities will be provided in our major coastal towns.  This is going to be extremely expensive for the taxpayer and it will be a drain on our resources but the resources will be provided and the Minister and the Government are committed to implementing the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In being honest and recognising the difficulties that will be encountered, in particular the financial difficulties, I do not want to see Deputy Gilmore jumping up like a vulture and trying to act as if he is in a court of law when I say that we will be lucky to be achieve this.  Yes, we will be lucky and will be doing <Col N="364" /> extremely well because, as time goes on, it will become far more expensive to provide these facilities.  Substantial public resources will be required, along with a substantial commitment on the part of the Government of the day, each year to the year 2,000, to put the necessary resources aside to allow us meet the laudable and necessary commitments made in the action plan.</P>
    <P>The action plan is not a sham and several things have happened on foot of it.  I regret that the legislation has been delayed.  I should say, however, to the handful of Deputies who have contributed to the debate in a comprehensive and thorough way that this has been a good and fair debate, that they have approached the legislation in a conscientious and open-minded fashion and have been prepared to listen to the views expressed by those who may hold a different opinion.  As we near the end of the debate I ask them not to allow party politics enter into the discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a substantial amount of money but I have no doubt that this Government, and I hope successive Governments will give a commitment to implement the plan during the next seven years as we approach the year 2,000 so that by that year we will have put in <Col N="365" /> place facilities to ensure that our seas and inland waters will not continue to be polluted in relation to the disposal of sewage.</P>

      <P>In page 74, after line 45, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Any recommendations made under this section shall be made available for public inspection and copies of such recommendations shall be made available for purchase at a cost not exceeding the cost of making the copies.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should say that I regard these as separate matters as they range over three sections.  However, the powers that be decide these matters and I have to accept their decision.  This means that we are going to have four mini-debates at the one time but this cannot be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 258c deals with the important question of providing information to the public.  There does not <Col N="366" /> appear to be any reference in section 101 of the need to make recommendations public.  Section 65, which unfortunately was not debated because the debate was guillotined, contains a provision which would allow information to be made available to the public but because I did not think it was strong enough I put down an amendment.</P>
    <P>Two important points need to be made in relation to the question of freedom of information.  First, so far as possible, and bearing in mind the need for confidentiality, all records of Government Departments and agencies should be available to the public.  There would not be much point however, in allowing the public to examine and read a long document as it is not feasible to read a report 30 to 40 pages long and make notes.  We have to move with the times.  Photocopying facilities ought to be available in Government offices for members of the public so that not only would they be able to inspect documents but photocopy them at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 258d to section 102 deals with special reports and investigations. Subsection (2) (a) reads &ldquo;the agency may cause a special report, or part thereof, to be published&rdquo;.  This amendment would substitute the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, while amendment No. 258d seeks to remove the words &ldquo;part thereof&rdquo; from the same line.  There is no reason the report should be published in full.  I also propose that the words &ldquo;subject to section 39&rdquo; should be inserted and this may allow the Minister to accept the amendment.  With some reluctance we agreed that section 39 was necessary as it will allow the Minister not to disclose certain confidential reports. This may be the reason the Minister of State is inserting the words &ldquo;part thereof&rdquo; to cover the reference made to the need for confidentiality in section 39.  If that is the case, my amendment would fit the bill as it would exclude any report covered by that section.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that amendment No. 258j is being discussed with amendment No. 258c because amendment 258j is to section 103 which deals with inquiries. <Col N="367" /> Subsection (8) of that section states that &ldquo;the agency may cause the report of a person who conducted an inquiry under the section to be made public&rdquo;.  It deals with section 103 (8), which says that the agency may cause the report of a person who conducted an inquiry under this section to be made public.  I feel very strongly that that word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is all rather complex and it is made more so by the fact that we are dealing with four different issues.  I would appreciate the Minister's comments on these amendments.</P>

      <P>I rise to support Deputy Garland's amendments because they hit on a very critical area of this Bill.  It is unfortunate that because of the way time has been arranged for the discussion of this Bill we have not managed to debate some sections of the Bill which would have highlighted this issue in a clearer way.  What we are talking about here is the whole question of access to information. It would have arisen in the context of section 39, 65 and also 108 which it is unlikely we will now reach.  However, it does arise here.  Deputy Garland's amendment makes it quite clear what he is trying to achieve, that is, that information is provided to the public.  I would like the Minister to address the position regarding the EC Directive on access to environmental information.  This directive was adopted in June 1990, but for some extraordinary reason it was not to be brought into force until 31 December 1992 by which stage all of the member states were to have introduced the necessary legislation and regulations providing for access to environmental information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill before us is defective in that area of making provision for access to environmental information.  The directive itself is quite a minimal directive. There are all kinds of escape hatches in it.  For example, member states may provide for the refusal of a request for information in a whole list of areas &mdash; for example, where matters are <i>sub judice</i>, or under inquiry, or under preliminary investigation and for reasons of commercial <Col N="368" /> and industrial confidentiality, including intellectual property.  There is a whole list of areas where information may be refused.  On top of that we have provisions in this Bill which will even further restrict access to information. Section 108, for example, provides for regulations to be made which would define the conditions and restrictions which would apply to access to information. Section 39 defines confidential information which cannot be given out.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain what is happening with regard to this State giving effect to the EC directive on access to information.  Quite clearly the Bill before us and the provisions that are in it for access to information will not be sufficient to meet the minimal requirements set down in the directive.  Does that mean that it will be necessary for regulations to be introduced to give the public access to environmental information? If that is the case, at what stage is the preparation of those regulations? Can the Minister give an assurance that the regulations will not be at some half way stage but will all be in place by 31 December?  It would be a great embarrassment to this State if this directive, which was signed on behalf of the EC by Deputy Flynn on 7 June 1990, is not complied with within the two and a half year time extension given to member states to provide the necessary legislation and regulations to give the public access to information on the environment.</P>
    <P>At the heart of many of the problems relating to the environment is this.  Very often people do not know the quality of the water they are drinking.  They cannot gain access to the tests that have been done on it.  They have worries about emissions into the air and about noise. They cannot get basic information.  I want to know when this State will put in place legislation or regulations which will entitle the public to get access to information held by public authorities about the environment.</P>

      <P>This Bill is to allow us to give effect to the European Community Directive on access to information.  The amendment I am tabling to section 108 makes it clear that we wish to give it full effect by 31 December.  Obviously the Bill does not refer to 31 December and regulations will have to be made, but certainly it is the intention that Ireland will meet the requirements in relation to the implementation of that directive by 31 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not disagree with the spirit of what Deputy Garland is seeking to do in his amendment.  I have some queries, and I know I may be storing up problems for myself on Report Stage.  In relation to section 101, amendment No. 258c, if I accept Deputy Garland's amendment in its present form it would effectively mean that if a Minister for the Environment wished to get the agency's assistance in relation to some sensitive or controversial matter, he may not feel free to do so or may not get the assistance of the agency.  It is desirable that the agency should be able to make recommendations and give advice to a Minister without that necessarily being made public in all cases. If we do not provide for that the Minister of the day may not use the agency but may use some other outside body to get information, advice and guidance. However, if we have an expert independent national body it is appropriate that that is the body that should be giving the information and advice to the Minister. If everything was to be made public it would inhibit a Minister who wanted <Col N="370" /> to deal with a particularly sensitive or controversial matter where it would not be in the interests of solving the matter to have all the recommendations out in public in advance of the Minister implementing them or even at any stage thereafter.  However, I have no problem with the agency making public any specifications it makes under that section. That would be desirable.</P>
    <P>I too, am committed to and interested in the widest possible access by the public to information in relation to the environment. There is a lot of interest in this country in relation to environmental information, much of it in relation to environmental information of a general, or educational type.  The ENFO office, which was opened in September 1990, has on average about 1,000 visitors a week and a further 300 or 400 postal and telephone queries; and that level of interest has, if anything, improved.  It was felt that there would be an initial flush of interest which would diminish thereafter. That has not happened and that indicates the level of interest among the community at large in seeking and getting authoritive information in relation to the environment.  That sort of information is more general or educational, but monitoring results and so on are available through the ENFO office.</P>
    <P>I also believe it is desirable that the public should have as much access as possible, subject to certain industrial, trade, commercial or intellectual secrets being protected and matters that are <i>sub judice</i> or under investigation or inquiry or that relate to personal data or to something that is either before the courts or may be before the courts and not necessarily covered by the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  Most people would accept that in matters relating to national security it would not be desirable that information would be made available.  Subject to those restrictions, virtually all other information should be made as available as possible to members of the public.</P>
    <P>That is why in 18 different sections in this Bill provision is made on an unprecedented scale to make information available.  The provision to enable the <Col N="371" /> public to inspect monitoring results, for example, is new and different.  If we are to have informed debates in relation to environmental issues it is essential that the public should have access to the information. Where information is given, even where there are some risks involved, it is mainly wisely used and serves the needs of the environment and helps companies with an open door policy on giving information.  Making information available has served companies more than withholding it.  Where members of the public or environmental organisations are denied information there is an assumption that the denial is because there is something wrong.  This would cause more problems for a company than it would solve.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 258c, it is desirable for a Minister to seek the advice and recommendation of the agency without that necessarily being made public.  That is why I do not accept that amendment.  In relation to amendment No. 258d I do not have any problem with the agency putting in a mandatory requirement that the agency shall cause a special report or part thereof to be published in such manner as they think fit.  The Deputy seeks to remove &ldquo;or part thereof&rdquo;.  We have to be realistic here. When I was in Norway, where they have a very accessible system of public information, I discussed with an authority there the effect of that and I concluded that the more rigid one makes the giving of information the more likely it becomes for things to be done at meetings or over the telephone or by way of not supplying certain information.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We have to be practical about this.  If we put a mandatory obligation on this agency to publish in full a report of any investigation then sensitive elements might be left out.  The agency may feel that if they say certain things in a certain way they could end up in court so they will minimise the risk of litigation and will therefore not be as <Col N="372" /> frank as perhaps they should be.  We must have confidence in the agency and give them some scope to be able to withhold some part of a special report in relation to an investigation or inquiry.  To fail to do so would lead the agency into a situation where information, because it is mandatory, gets presented in a very bland or general form.  That would not be in our interests and that is why &ldquo;part thereof&rdquo; is included in section 102.  The same thing applies in relation to an inquiry.</P>
      <P>In relation to all these sections I do not have problems in a general sense with a mandatory requirement.  My intention was to have the greatest possible access to environmental information and to have it provided in a way that is practical and effective and which allows the agency to conduct their affairs as we would wish them to.  Nobody would expect a business not to conduct business privately in lots of situations.  Information in relation to monitoring results, the outcome of inquiries into the cause of pollution accidents or incidents and the giving of information or recommendations to the agency about emission values and quality standards should be public in a way that is effective and practical and which allows the Minister of the Government to be able to use the facility of the agency without having that necessarily in the public arena, which could prejudice any decisions made or place a Minister in a particularly difficult situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to be giving a little bit on amendment 258c so on that basis I will withdraw that amendment.  I am disappointed with the Minister's response to my other three amendments.  We already have a draconian clause in section 39 which gives considerable discretion to the Minister to have non-disclosure in certain cases.  We do not want to be totally unreasonable and we realise that sometimes things cannot be published for a variety of reasons.  It is a question of achieving a balance.  The balance here is still very much on the side of secrecy.  There is still far too much secrecy.  Even a fairly <Col N="373" /> innocuous report like the Zoo report, which was made about 18 months ago, is still not available to the public.</P>

      <P>Deputy Garland seeks to make it mandatory to make regulations on any matter or procedure relating to the operation of the section.  The matter would be satisfied if the Minister were to make a very loose regulation in relation to the holding of inquiries.  It does not necessarily follow that the agency will then hold an inquiry.  This legislation is phrased as loosely as possible to allow the Minister to frame regulations when it is necessary to hold an inquiry.  The insertion of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not make anything happen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland's amendment No. 258g to section 103 would compel the agency to hold a mandatory inquiry in every case.  That is not necessary.  Every act of pollution will not necessitate the holding of an inquiry.  I do not see the need for a mandatory requirement.  The amendment to subsection (1) (b) is also unnecessary because the cause of pollution might be obvious and an inquiry would be superfluous.  Mandatory powers are not necessary either for the agency or for the Minister in relation to the holding of inquiries.  An inquiry can of course, be held if the agency feel it is justified in respect of a particular incident.</P>

      <P>In page 75, subsection (3) (b), line 31, to delete &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to delete the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  I recall a debate on this matter on the Water Pollution (Amendment) Bill.  The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; could be used as an excuse for delay and prevarication by somebody who has something to hide.  The rights of the community and of the country at large should override the rights of individuals. It may be inconvenient to allow an inspector to enter a premises.  The factory may be working at full strength or somebody could be called upon at night to open up a factory.  Nobody is suggesting that people should be submitted to a reign of terror, with inspectors harassing people at all hours of the day and night to inspect incidents.  I am sure people in the agency will be reasonable and will not harass people who are trying to go about their business in a lawful manner. On the other hand, I want to ensure that staff of the agency will not be fobbed off with excuses.  This is a serious point and I hope the Minister can accept this simple amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly cannot accept this amendment.  To do so would give power to an officer which would not be found in a police state.  If somebody wishes to enter a premises at a time that is not reasonable, say in the middle of the night, it is desirable that a warrant should be required.  It would be very unreasonable to delete the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; from this paragraph.  We are seeking to ensure that officers of the agency can enter premises at a reasonable time, obviously during working hours.  In some factories working hours are quite extensive, perhaps through the night.  In other instances premises close at a particular time.  Where the premises are closed, a warrant should be sought to enter.  This would enable an officer to enter at times other than reasonable times.  We want to provide that the work will be carried out at a time that is considered reasonable by <Col N="376" /> most people.  All of us would subscribe to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would find it difficult to support this amendment.  Inquiries usually occur after an event.  The deletion of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; would mean that people would have to be available at all hours of the day and night after the person carrying out the inquiry had gone through the rigmarole of consultation between the agency and the Minister and securing the Minister's consent to the holding of an inquiry.</P>
      <P>It seems that the purpose of entering a premises would be to inspect books, the condition of the premises and so on.  Anybody who wished to cover up something would have sufficient time to do so between the time of instigation of the inquiry and the time permission is granted to carry out the inquiry.  A number of inquiries has been carried out recently and in these cases they have been held sometime after the event.  One would expect the inspector to carry out his duties within the normal timescale when people are available in premises.  I agree with the Minister that people should not be harassed and should not have to attend an inquiry at unusual hours of the night.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the point I have made. Under subsection (1) (b) of this section the Minister may direct that an inquiry be held.  Under subsection (1) (a) the agency may hold an inquiry where, after consultation with the Minister, they consider it necessary to do so.  Given that the Minister has power to direct the holding of an inquiry the only purpose of consultation would be for the Minister to persuade the agency not to hold an inquiry.  On the one hand the Minister is giving the agency power to hold an inquiry while on the other hand she is taking back that power.  There is no necessity for the clause &ldquo;where after consultation with the Minister it considers it necessary to do so&rdquo;.  The agency should be trusted and should be given the power to hold inquiries if they believe that is <Col N="377" /> necessary.  I would ask the Minister to accept that proposal, and I will be putting down an amendment on Report Stage to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell is right in that the agency may be directed by the Minister to hold an inquiry.  The agency may hold an inquiry but only after consulting the Minister for the Environment. We are talking here about setting up a formalised inquiry procedure, and we all know how cumbersome, expensive and difficult it is to set up such a procedure. It is desirable, for a number of reasons, that the agency consult with the Minister before holding an inquiry.  First, finance would have to be forthcoming to fund the inquiry.  Second, some other body may be carrying out a similar inquiry or the Government may be in the process of deciding that some other body should carry out the inquiry.  Therefore, it is desirable that the agency do not act in a vacuum without consultation.  It is clear from subsection (1) (a) that the agency do not necessarily have to take on board the Minister's views.  They will be free to hold an inquiry, but it is desirable that they do so only after consultation with the Minister and when they are aware of what may be happening in other areas. A number of Ministers or agencies may be involved in an environmental pollution incident.  For example, the Minister for the Marine could be involved or if the pollution relates to agriculture the Minister for Agriculture and Food could be involved.  It is important that the agency do not establish a formalised inquiry without consulting with the Minister. For that reason it is desirable to leave the provision as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Garland is pursuing his amendment, but this would be a draconian power to give to an officer of the agency or some other person carrying out an inquiry.  If premises have to be entered it is desirable that it be done at a reasonable time.  If an unreasonable time must be chosen when nobody is available in the premises, the protection of the court should be forthcoming.  Without that protection it is not desirable to <Col N="378" /> give a power such as this to somebody involved in an inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was distracted for a moment because Deputy Mitchell strayed from the subject matter of the amendment.  I am not at all mollified by the Minister's reply.  Deputy Kavanagh referred to such matters as inspecting books.  Obviously, if a mere inspection of books or documents was involved it would be reasonable that the inspection be carried out during normal office hours, but I am referring to incidents in continuous process industries, particularly in industries involving emissions.  It is well known &mdash; this occurred very extensively in the Merck Sharp and Dohme case &mdash; that emissions from factories are deliberately made in the early hours of the morning when county council monitoring staff are not available.  I would be glad if the Minister could facilitate me by putting down an amendment on Report Stage indicating that these powers be given only in exceptional circumstances. I am sure the Minister would agree that pollution occurs on a 24 hour basis and that it may be necessary to be on the premises at all times of the day to monitor serious pollution incidents.  I would like the Minister to reconsider this matter because she has not grasped the enormity of what I am saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Garland misunderstood my reference to the inspector entering a premises only to inspect books.  I would underline that my argument in this respect is about inquiries rather than about the general operation of inspectors investigating pollution incidents. We are talking about carrying out an inquiry following an incident of environmental pollution.  I would imagine it would be well known to the owner of the premises involved that the inquiry was going to be held, and in those circumstances it is unlikely that the pollution would continue.  I hope that puts Deputy Garland's mind at ease as regards my opposition to his amendment.  It is appropriate that an inquiry be carried out <Col N="379" /> within a reasonable time, and we should include a provision to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing the question of authorised officers entering premises, at the suggestion of Deputy Gilmore I said I would come back with an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.  The Bill as drafted provides that an authorised officer, if refused entry to a premises, must go to the court for a warrant.  The Deputy pointed out that the inspector should be allowed seek a warrant in the first instance in anticipation of being refused rather than going to the premises and being refused, thus giving a warning that he will be back.  I gave a commitment that I would bring in an amendment on Report Stage to deal with that matter.  Such a provision would allow an authorised officer of the agency, in carrying out an inspection for the purposes of compliance with the licence, to enter a premises at virtually any time. They would have a warrant in their possession for the purposes of investigation or inspection, as was requested by Deputy Garland.</P>
      <P>We are talking here about the holding of an inquiry into an incident of pollution. Substantial powers are being given to the person charged with the holding of that inquiry.  We have to be reasonable.  I do not want to introduce any measure that would deprive people of natural justice or that would not be fair or reasonable. For the purposes of inspection I believe it is reasonable for somebody to enter at any time a factory that operates all night. However, unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise, inspections should be carried out during the normal working hours of the premises but if there should be a very good reason for carrying out an inspection at any other time the person charged with holding an inquiry could get a warrant and enter the premises at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour this point because the debate is becoming very convoluted.  The Minister appears to have taken my point to some extent.  I <Col N="380" /> do recall now that a similar issue arose earlier in the debate.  I am asking her by way of amendment on Report Stage, to ensure that whatever provision she makes in relation to warrants and so on should clearly cover an inquiry as well as an investigation of an incident.</P>
      <P>There is perhaps a feeling that an inquiry is something that is carried out after an incident.  Sometimes pollution is a continuing problem rather than a single incident.  Unfortunately, the reason for incidents of pollution, particularly air pollution, is that some of our industrial plants are simply inadequate.  One purpose of an inquiry would be to establish whether the incidence of pollution was continuing.  Although there may be a perception that an inquiry is not as important as an inspection, the two are very closely related.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to an issue that I thought would be ruled out of order during discussion on the amendments, had I sought to raise it then.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the cost of several of the inquiries that have taken place in the past few years in other areas.  It is my contention that the agency should consult with the Minister so that, in one area at least, the Minister would have a reasonable idea of what cost was to be involved. In respect of other inquiries the cost of calling witnesses and so on has proved quite expensive and, regardless of how important the matter may be, there is concern about the amount of money being paid to professionals such as lawyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain well publicised cases individuals who have been required to appear before boards carrying out inquiries have <Col N="381" /> resisted such requests.  I understand that there is a possibility that one of the sections of the Companies Act, 1990, is unconstitutional and that on those grounds individuals are refusing to appear before inquiries.  I hope that this section will have the effect of remedying any weakness there may be in other legislation whereby individuals required to appear before the person charged with inquiring into an incident might refuse to attend an inquiry and give evidence, whether under oath or otherwise.  It is because of recent experiences whereby people of wealth were able to take every opportunity to use the law in order to justify their refusal to appear before a properly constituted inquiry that I ask the Minister whether loopholes that may have been discovered in other legislation are being closed off in this provision in order to ensure that persons who may be responsible for causing an incident of pollution may not refuse to attend an inquiry.</P>

      <P>This section does not necessarily provide for sworn inquiries or for the expensive kind of inquiries we have had recently.  I was very surprised when Deputy Spring seemed to try to justify the enormous fees paid to lawyers and accountants taking part in recent inquiries.  I consider the daily fees being charged and paid to these people to be outrageous and completely unjustified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine for example has power to order an inquiry into marine incidents.  Such inquiries, conducted by way of the Marine Survey Office do not cost a fortune.  Likewise, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications has power to order an inquiry into rail accidents.  He can request the rail inspector to hold an inquiry and to report on his findings.  When I was Minister for Transport I ordered a couple of such inquiries and they did not cost a fortune.  They cost very little but they were very effective in elucidating the facts, making recommendations and, when necessary, censuring those at fault. The position in relation to air accidents is similar.  Again, the Minister for Tourism, <Col N="382" /> Transport and Communications has power to order inquiries into such accidents, as I did in relation to the Air India disaster.  It is not necessary that these inquiries be judicial inquiries out of which lawyers and other fat cats make a fortune &mdash; some of the payments in values would make the Taoiseach's salary for his entire term of office look meagre. That will be another day's work, but we do have to do something about the cost of inquiries and the fees paid.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to elaborate on the kind of inquiry she envisages under this section.  Has she anticipated the possibility of frequent public sworn inquiries, which would cost a fortune, or has she in mind the kind of inquiries already provided for in relation to transport and marine matters?</P>
    <P>Section 103 (1) needs some consideration. If the Minister is concerned that the agency might order an inquiry off their own bat, regardless of the possible cost and regardless of the Minister's views, why does she not just delete the clause?  Why does she not be upfront and take away the independent power of the agency to hold an inquiry and reserve that as a role of the Minister?  As it stands, the agency may hold an inquiry only after consultation with the Minister.  Effectively that means that, if the Minister puts an arm on the agency &mdash; to use a colloquialism &mdash; and says: we do not want an inquiry, they will not hold one.  On the other hand, if the Minister wants an inquiry, she has power, because of the following paragraph, to direct that one be held.  This subsection, as drafted, gives the appearance of allowing the agency power to hold an inquiry whereas, in practice, they will not have that power, the power will rest with the Minister. Why do we not redraft the section to make that abundantly clear?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a couple of points on the section.  It appears to me that the only growth industry in the country at present is that of establishing inquiries affording much lucrative <Col N="383" /> employment to some of the legal profession.</P>
      <P>While it is correct that the agency have power to establish an inquiry there are a couple of provisions in the section I should like the Minister to explain.  The first has to do with the costs of conducting an inquiry.  Some Members have referred already to the costs of some inquiries we have witnessed in recent times.  There is provision in this section that part of the costs incurred by the agency themselves can be recouped from the person who, in the opinion of the agency, is responsible for any pollution caused.  I am curious how that can be given effect.  For example, would the agency, having established an inquiry, having found that somebody was at fault, then have to go to court to endeavour to recover their costs?  In addition, would the costs concerned apply only to the costs of the agency themselves, of witnesses, or whatever would be necessary for the conduct of the inquiry?</P>
      <P>The second aspect of this section that causes me some concern is subsection (5) which reads:</P>
      <P>A statement or admission made by a person before a person conducting an inquiry under this section shall not be admissible in evidence against that person in any criminal proceedings other than proceedings in relation to an offence under subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would mean circumstances could arise in which an inquiry was established, the inquiry may find that somebody is responsible &mdash; probably it would be a serious act of pollution to have justified the establishment of an inquiry in the first place &mdash; but any statement or admission made by tha person to the inquiry is not admissible in evidence.  It appears to me that that would create a very anomalous position, that an inquiry could establish who was responsible for an act of pollution but that responsibility would simply have to stop there, that the evidence assembled by the agency in the course of the inquiry would not be admissible in evidence if the case was <Col N="384" /> brought to court.  That may be a weakness in the provision for the establishment of an inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of very interesting issues have arisen here.  First, in response to Deputy Jim Mitchell, may I say that on many occasions when we discussed various provisions of this Bill, whenever a Minister was required to consult the agency, Deputy Mitchell always felt that was very weak, contending that the Minister should be compelled to take on board the view of the agency.  Now, when it is the other way round, when the agency must consult the Minister, he appears to think that is a very strong power and the agency must follow what the Minister says but the Minister does not have to follow what the agency say. The word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; appears to have a different meaning in a different context as far as Deputy Jim Mitchell is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two forms of inquiry provided for in this Bill.  For example, in section 102 provision is made for a very informal, quick, inquiry the agency can conduct.  I was keen to ensure that we would provide for a simple, less formal inquiry, which could solve many of the difficulties that might arise and provide the kind of information and report allowing action to follow.  The second type of inquiry provided for in this section obviously is a more formal one, such as those we have had recently in relation to other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore drew attention to the fact that the costs of conducting the inquiry in section 103 (9) can be recouped by the agency from the person, or persons, responsible for the pollution incident. Deputy Gilmore posed an interesting question: would that have to be decided in court?  If there was a dispute, obviously it would have to be decided in court.  For example, if the agency established that X was responsible but X disputed that, obviously that dispute would have to be resolved in the <Col N="385" /> courts.  While the cost of conducting an inquiry, of calling witnesses and so on, can be recouped from the person or persons responsible, that does not prejudice the agency, or some other body, from prosecuting the person, or persons, convicted under the normal prosecution powers of the Bill and have a fine of up to £10 million imposed.  Therefore, the cost of the inquiry is borne and can be laid against the person charged with having committed the offence.  Obviously a prosecution would follow if somebody was held to be responsible for a particular pollution incident.</P>
    <P>In regard to whether there can be a sworn inquiry &mdash; Deputy Jim Mitchell posed this question &mdash; yes, an inquiry can be a sworn inquiry or otherwise; the power to hold a sworn inquiry is a &ldquo;may&rdquo; or possible power rather than a mandatory power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore posed an interesting question in relation to the giving of evidence, asking why that would not be used subsequently in any court proceedings to prejudice the person who may have given such evidence.  To be quite honest I do not know the answer to that.  The Deputy has raised an interesting question which I will have clarified for Report Stage.  It would appear to me to be reasonable that such evidence be admissible in court. Perhaps the reason for inclusion of a provision of this kind is to ensure that people are as forthcoming and helpful as possible to the agency in conducting an inquiry. If evidence was admissible, obviously it might prevent the court from having to go through the whole matter again, if it were a proper, formal inquiry in relation to a major matter so that it would not involve a total rehash of all of the proceedings and its attendant costs.</P>
    <P>We have learned much in recent times about inquiries, the cost, structures and so on.  Hopefully these costs can be awarded in the first instance against the people responsible for the holding of an inquiry and, second, those people found guilty or negligent as a result of the holding of such inquiries.  I know provision is made in the Companies Act that a limit of, I think, £100,000 can be awarded <Col N="386" /> against each company.  When that Bill was being drafted many people felt that was an excessive cost for an inquiry.  But, within a very short time of that Act being implemented, we have seen that a figure of £100,000 was not necessarily enormous. In the case of the Greencore inquiry, because there is a large number of companies involved, presumably, an amount of that kind can be awarded against each of the companies involved and, hopefully, all of the costs saved from the point of view of the taxpayer.  I understand that matter is at present before the courts and therefore I do not wish to say any more about it.  It would be my desire and intention, so far as environmental inquiries are concerned, that the costs of holding the inquiry, the summoning of witnesses and so on, would all be borne by the people responsible for the environmental pollution incident that had caused or led to the inquiry in the first place. That is why there is provision made therefor in this section.  Obviously that would be on dispute, subject to resolution by the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to assume that, in every case of serious environmental incident, the person concerned or responsible for that incident, will be either traceable or could afford to pay the costs of an inquiry.  In practice that may not be the case.  It might well be that such an incident would bankrupt a company that owned, say, a lorry, ship or whatever involved in the incident, or they may not be traceable or amenable to our jurisdiction.  From time to time, environmental incidents will occur, inquiries into which will incur costs which will not be recoupable from the person who caused the incident.  The Minister ought to face up to that reality because, in practice, that is likely to happen at least on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to examine the railway inspectorate as a possible example of a way of monitoring or inquiring into environmental accidents, as constituting a very low cost but effective manner of so doing.  For many years the railway inspector was an employee of the <Col N="387" /> Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.  He was not employed in the rail section and had this independent function.  He was also independent of the Minister.  He continued to act as a railway inspector even after he retired from the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Very effective inquiries have been held into serious railway accidents.  As most of these inquiries are held in the City Hall in Dublin no costs have been incurred in hiring premises.  These inquiries have been very effective in recommending improvements in standards, changing design, etc., to avoid such accidents recurring in the future.  They have also been very effective in pointing out culpability. Therefore, inquiries do not have to be a high cost vehicle for establishing who is at fault, what caused an accident and how such accidents can be prevented in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify a point which occurred to me when she was speaking.  If there is a railway accident involving the Ballina train&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is there a danger of conflict?  As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, if there is a major train accident involving the Ballina train which brings the acrylonitrile to the Asahi plant, will the inquiry be carried out under rail legislation or under this Bill?  Is there also a danger of conflict or has the matter been decided?  I hope Deputy Garland accepts that that is a very pertinent point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell has made some valid points about inquiries. He referred to the railway inspectorate. I am not too familiar with inquiries into rail matters, but I will examine the point made by the Deputy in this regard.  The preliminary investigation into the Telecom affair last summer was carried out by public servants in a very effective and speedy manner.  It has to be made clear that every inquiry does not have to be carried out by an accountant or lawyer. Some very effective inquiries can be conducted by public and civil servants.  This is why I believe officers of the agency will be able to conduct inquiries in many cases.</P>
      <P>With regard to marine pollution incidents, obviously the pollution at sea legislation, which was recently introduced and which imposes a similar fine of £10 million for an offence, will apply in such instances.  Obviously consultation would have to be held to decide who will carry out the inquiry.  I would envisage that in the case of accidents similar to the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident or a rail disaster, a combination of people would be involved in the inquiry &mdash; the agency may be given the responsibility for carrying out the inquiry and other people may become involved in it.  Obviously this will depend on the circumstances and the consequences of the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as pollution or environmental damage is concerned, I imagine that any inquiry held after the establishment of the agency will be held with the co-operation and help of the agency and that some of these powers would be brought into effect, even if other bodies were <Col N="389" /> responsible for the inquiry.  I am sure the Environmental Protection Agency would wish an inquiry to be held into a rail disaster in so far as environmental matters are concerned.  They may wish to join the two aspects of the inquiry together.  The provisions in this section are flexible enough to allow this to happen.  This is why provision is being made for consultation with the Minister who obviously will be in a position to inform the agency about what is happening and allow other people to become involved in the inquiry in extraordinary circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, will the Minister look at the possibility of inserting an additional subsection or paragraph in this section which would allow for co-operation in other inquiries? This may not be necessary but I ask the Minister to look at this point.</P>

Is there need for section 103 (11) in view of the fact that section 6 (1) provides that: &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed or in relation to any matter referred to in this Act as the subject of regulations or for the purpose of giving full effect to this Act&rdquo;?

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 258k:</P>
      <P>In page 77, subsection (1), line 3, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is necessary in this instance because we are dealing with the problem of noise which may damage people's health or constitute a danger to it.  This problem may call for the making of regulations.  There should be an obligation on the Minister to make regulations in such circumstances without any pressure having to be imposed by outside bodies.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; does not make sense in these circumstances.  I ask the Minister to accept that the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is necessary in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used so that the Minister may make regulations when it is felt necessary.  If the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; were to be used it would mean that the Minister would be compelled to introduce regulations literally from the time the Bill is passed, even when they may not necessarily be required.  The rest of the provisions in this section give the Minister sufficient powers in relation to the control of noise. For example, provision is made for the imposition of charges or the payment of fees for the purposes of regulations or for services performed thereunder; the measurement of noise; the investigation of noise, etc.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would put an onus on the Minister from the time the Bill is passed to make specific regulations which may not be necessary.  Obviously regulations will be made where they are necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister should remember that in the context of noise emanating from roads it is the Department <Col N="391" /> of the Environment who will have to eliminate that nuisance.  Future Ministers may not make regulations because they will impose a responsibility on their Department.  In the interests of the general public, people's health, etc., the Minister should be obliged to make regulations where it is clear that damage is being caused to people's health or property. There should be an obligation on the Minister to make regulations in such instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barrett's remarks.  I am thinking of a case at the moment &mdash; which I am sure Deputy Barrett had in mind in tabling his amendment. Currently a problem has arisen regarding noise levels emanating from the newly constructed Bray-Shankill bypass.  Householders along the route are experiencing difficulties in regard to the noise on the road.  Sometimes in the middle of the night heavy trucks travelling to and from Rosslare wake people who then cannot get back to sleep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another section of the Bill there is an exemption clause, that regulations relating to noise will not cover local authorities. It appears that the Minister has in mind being able to make regulations in regard to a private interest, a factory, disco or place of entertainment from which a lot of noise is emanating. However, under this legislation it appears that public authorities &mdash; in particular local authorities &mdash; are exempted. I know that when the issue relating to the Bray-Shankill bypass was raised with Dublin County Council they undertook a noise study impact, which established that they can carry out as many noise studies as they like but there is no standard to determine whether anything should be done about it.  Regulations need to be introduced in this regard, and Deputy Barrett is quite right in saying that the Department of the Environment would have to bear the cost of any remedial works carried out.  It would mean that the Minister might say that regulations could not be made dealing with roadways because it would involve <Col N="392" /> cost but that perhaps regulations might be brought in to deal with something else. The legislation should oblige the Minister for the Environment to make regulations dealing with noise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore's comments are the reason for my two amendments.  It is a scandal that local authorities and other bodies who design roads do not have any obligation to adhere to certain standards, particularly in relation to noise.  The Bray-Shankill bypass is a beautiful road and its users say it is very successful.  However, if you live right beside it, as Deputy Gilmore said, you are woken up at all hours of the night and there is no obligation on the local authority or the Department to do anything about it because there are no standards in this regard.</P>
      <P>My next amendment would have required the Minister to make regulations in relation to noise emanating from roads.  I will give an other example. The Southern Cross route will now stop at Sandyford Industrial Estate and there is no obligation on the local authority to take into account the nuisance and the danger to the health and safety of the people who live near it.  When the traffic reaches the Sandyford Industrial Estate it will then have to travel on Brewery Road and Leopardstown Road and the people living on those roads have no protection from the noise.  There is no obligation on the local authority, in their overall development, to take these people into account.  If noise emanating from a disco at 1 a.m. is a danger to health and causes a nuisance to everybody, there should be a similar attitude in regard to developing or building roads. The local authority should be required to adhere to certain standards in relation to noise and there should be clear regulations to protect the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because Deputy Gilmore, other people and I threatened not to attend the opening of the Bray-Shankill bypass, the residents eventually succeeded in having a wall or noise barrier built.  This matter is under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and there is a requirement <Col N="393" /> to have regulations to protect the public from noise.  There should also be clear standards in relation to road building.</P>

If the Minister cannot accept &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo; because of the time problem, perhaps she will come back on Report Stage with &ldquo;the Minister shall, within a certain given period&rdquo; to get over the point she made.</P>
      <P>Something must be done about noisy roads.  Deputies Barrett and Gilmore mentioned the Bray-Shankill bypass but the same applies to many other roads. People have been greatly inconvenienced by the noise on the new Navan road dual carriageway.  Indeed the noise is right outside their doors and the county council have put on the long finger an application for assistance for installing double glazing.  Residents on a section of that road are being treated as unreasonable although they can no longer use their front bedrooms.  Their houses were destroyed by muck and dirt over the years when the road was being built and they had to repaint their houses; indeed some of the pillars were cracked.  There must be provision for compensation in cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The more the debate goes on the more convinced I am that it is essential to have the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, possibly with the addition of a time limit. The Minister seems to be saying that it may not be necessary to introduce regulations but she must realise that we do not need an inquiry or an Environmental Protection Agency to tell us that there is a serious noise pollution problem.  Presumably, regulations will be made but they must be mandatory.  We should do this before roads are built.  Deputies mentioned the problems of the Navan Road, the Bray-Shankill bypass and the Southern Cross route.  I know that residents of an estate in Sandyford are already agitating &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; about the Southern Cross route.  They are demanding double glazing and proper screening <Col N="394" /> from the noise.  There is no point in costing a road unless these items are also taken into account.  If not, the road goes ahead and afterwards people expect local authorities to help them with the cost of double glazing and so on.  However, local authorities do not have the money to spend on items of this kind.  Double glazing, reasonable noise screening with trees or walls are an integral cost of a large-scale road development and they should be built into the cost at the beginning.</P>

      <P>As this section is headed &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;, the opportunity was taken during the course of the Bill's preparation to make provision for a number of other matters, for example, provisions in relation to noise.  I accept many points made by the Deputies in relation to the law as it stands.  It is unsatisfactory and that is why sections 104, 105 and 106 provide, in the case of section 104, for new regulations, and in the case of the other two sections, for new powers for local authorities and others in relation to noise pollution problems.  I do not deny that there is a need to make regulations. Deputy Garland seems to take the view that because &ldquo;may&rdquo; is in the section I do not accept the need to make regulations, but there is a need to make them as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputies have indicated the practical difficulties in relation to these issues but the &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; section of the Bill deal with general provisions.  Unfortunately, we will not reach section 108 dealing with the introduction of the access to information directive or sections 109 and 110 in relation to genetically modified organisms.  This directive should have been introduced here some time ago but, because we did not have any legislation in that regard, we were not in a position to comply with the directive.  That is why the opportunity was used in this legislation to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot give an undertaking to come back with an amendment on Report Stage but I will certainly reconsider some of the points made to see if I can strengthen the powers.  Introducing the word <Col N="395" />&ldquo;shall&rdquo; means that something has to happen almost immediately.  That is neither practical nor feasible but I will have further discussions with my officials on the provisions in section 104 in advance of Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate on the last occasion I said I was opposed to the abolition of the Land Commission unless they are replaced by a land authority.  I fully recognise and appreciate the difficult work the Land Commission carried out. There is a land bank awaiting to be divided and farmers would like to know if this will take place before the Land Commission are abolished.  It is important we get an answer to that question. There is still a great interest in the division <Col N="396" /> of land.  The importance of this cannot be overstated.  The fragmentation of small farms is still a major problem and it will be necessary to give farmers more land if their holdings are to become viable.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission officials were very knowledgeable in the division of land and nobody was better placed to handle this work.  Very few land transfers took place over the past 12 to 18 months. The reasons include the decline in farm incomes and the reluctance of people to acquire more land because of the tax implications.  Nobody was in a better position to advise people on land acquisition than the Land Commission officials.  It would be wrong if the knowledge they gained from their experience was not available to some other authority. That knowledge should be passed on to young officials.</P>
      <P>People from Germany and France who buy up parcels of land adjacent to our lakes or rivers became quite arrogant. They fence off the land and do not allow others pass through it.  It has been the tradition that farmers allowed people to cross their land to rivers and lakes.  Farmers are to be admired for permitting this. The foreigners see the potential when they visit the country as tourists but when they buy the land they fence it off with barbed wire to prevent people trespassing. The public have the right of way through land adjacent to our rivers and lakes but I do not know if that has any standing in law.</P>
      <P>If we are to arrest the decline in population in rural areas we must do so on the basis of agricultural enterprises.  There is no point in codding ourselves that a fairy godmother will bring major industries that will provide employment.  We have to generate employment from our own resources, from our &ldquo;green gold&rdquo;.  There is no question but that we can generate wealth from alternative farm enterprise and agri-tourism.  We are only scratching the surface in regard to agri-tourism but if we are to be successful in that regard farmers must have viable holdings that will enable them provide proper accommodation for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> I should like to give some startling statistics in regard to population trends in some counties from 1926 to 1991.  In 1926 the population of County Cavan was 82,452 but in 1991 it was 52,756, a decline of 36 per cent in the intervening 65 years. That decline has to be arrested.  In the neighbouring county of Monaghan, which is in the same constituency, the population stood at 65,131 in 1926 and in 1991 it was 51,262, a drop of 21.1 per cent.  While the population decline is not as dramatic as in my county it was, nevertheless, a serious decline in population. The population of County Leitrim in 1926 was 55,907 and in 1991 it was down to 25,297, a decline of 54 per cent.  This is frightening.  The decline is continuing and this is very sad.  People can enjoy a very healthy life in rural Ireland, and we can create prosperity but they must be directed.  We need people with ability to encourage others and to reassure them that it is not all doom and gloom.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Energy issued a very glossy brochure from the EC on afforestation.  The whole drive in the EC is towards afforestation.  Trees will not sustain a farmer on the land.  I am totally opposed, as I am sure is the Minister to arable land being bought up by insurance companies and other private investors for tree planting.  This should not be allowed.  The available grants should be confined to marginal land because this should be planted and I have always held that view.  It is a step in the wrong direction to plant trees on arable land.  This will drive people from their homes.  The outlook becomes bleaker the closer the forest comes to people's homes.  This spoils the countryside and the potential for tourism.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to afforestation because there is a role in certain areas but its potential is overstated.  I can talk from experience.  My father planted a forest of four acres 45 years ago but it has not generated as much as one penny of income.  It is a mature forest but if I go to the mill and discuss the sale of the timber, they make all sorts of excuses. They say it would be hardly worth their time setting up the machinery to harvest <Col N="398" /> timber.  There is a great deal of talk about the wealth that can come from afforestation, but I wonder if this is true.  I accept that the thinnings of our national forest are transported via Butlersbridge to Northern Ireland for processing but I would like to know how much we get for that timber.  Would the millers and processors in Northern Ireland be keen to cut and draw the timber if there was not good profit in it for them?  How much do the owners of the forests get for the timber?</P>
    <P>There is a role and a place for afforestation but I think we are being carried away.  I can imagine a farmer over 55 years of age who, because of the grants available, would say: &ldquo;That is a handy way out for me.  I will plant a few acres and I will get a few pounds in headage grants&rdquo;.  I would prefer to see the green fields left there for a younger generation to develop.  We can still produce the best foodstuffs in Europe, there is still a demand for quality food.  We have that end of our business totally wrong as inquiries have now shown.  I hope, when they are sorted out, we will get back on the rails and create a good Irish image and a brand name like &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; for dairy products.  There is a market of 320 million people in Europe, a large percentage of whom would pay a premium price for quality food.  The amount we are producing is neither here nor there in the context of the food mountains in Europe.  These are just a few brief comments in support of what the Land Commission did when so many people were critical of them.  They had a difficult and trying job and I would like to see a land authority replace them.</P>

      <P>I spoke at length on this Bill two years ago and I do not intend to repeat what I said then.  At that time I spoke for over an hour.  I had done a lot of research into the dissolution of the Land Commission at that time.  It would be futile if I were to repeat what I said then.  I hope my remarks were considered by the Minister when he was preparing his speech.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made a very interesting contribution which I have read in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  Today I hope to ask a few further questions and to make a few points.  On the last occasion when this Bill was before the House I made a lengthy contribution to the debate outlining the various developments and reports leading up to the decision to abolish the Land Commission. On this occasion I will confine my remarks to those aspects of the Bill which will cause problems in the area of land use and land structure unless they are considered in greater detail than appears to be the case at present.</P>
      <P>I am starting from the base that compulsory and voluntary acquisition of land by the Land Commission is now at an end.  The only land divisions taking place are in respect of small remnants of properties in the hands of the Land Commission at present.  There are, of course, substantial areas of bog and rough grazing that remain to be disposed of.  The intention presumably is that under the powers contained in the Bill these will be sold publicly to the highest bidder.  The end of acquisition and division of land by the Land Commission coincides with the official line that nowadays there is no need for State intervention in the land market and that structural changes can best be left to the free play of market forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fair estimate that there are still between 50,000 to 70,000 uneconomic smallholders in the country who must look to their own resources to get that valuable bit of extra land that would help them become viable.  These people will no longer have the opportunity to purchase extra land that would sustain a normal family on the land now that the Land Commission are gone.  This was one of the great successes of the Land Commission.  They provided extra land to provide a family with a reasonable income.  This is no longer the case and it would seem that small farmers are now <Col N="400" /> left to the free play of market forces.  I wonder how many will be able to compete in the open market for that extra land.  They have no prospect of obtaining land from the Land Commission and there are no loans available on favourable terms to buy land.  Banks are putting pressure on all farmers and certainly they will not entertain loans for small farmers because they have no collateral.  The small farmer cannot compete with the farmer who has bigger milk quotas, bank reserves built up over many years and a long family tradition in farming.  We are condemning at least 50,000 of our farmers to a life off the land and to a life, in some cases, of unemployment.  What is happening in this country &mdash; I am not blaming the Minister, it seems to be EC policy also &mdash; is that we are removing the heart and soul of rural Ireland from the land by having no structural policy or no land use policy.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out by the Minister that the following jobs are still left for the Land Commission to carry out: helping tenants to rearrange their farms; helping group purchases of land; encouraging leasing; controlling the sub-division of farms and the purchase of land by non-nationals and the division of commonage.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on these items.  In regard to rearrangement, the great inducement which the Land Commission was able to offer in the past to those whose lands were being rearranged was some extra land to round off their holdings and make them more compact. This was the sweetner, the carrot, that often persuaded the difficult and uncooperative farmer to join in a rearrangement. That sweetener no longer exists. How then can rearrangement be encouraged and promoted by simply giving technical advice on layout and mapping details?  I would like to be informed of the number of farmers who have availed of this encouragement and advice over the past year or so and who have carried through a rearrangement of their farms. How many holdings were rearranged and what areas were involved?  How significant was the rearrangement in terms of reducing the number of scattered parcels <Col N="401" /> and achieving compact units?  The same remarks apply to group purchases.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any monetary inducements it must be very hard for Land Commission inspectors to persuade a group of small farmers to band together to buy a particular property and then divide it among themselves.  I would appreciate full details of the number and type of such transactions in which the Land Commission have been involved over the past year or two, together with an assessment of whether the Land Commission input has been particularly helpful in this respect.  Perhaps the Minister would answer those questions in his reply.</P>
    <P>On the subject of leasing, we all know that land mobility is very limited and that leasing on a medium or long term basis could help some small farmers to get extra land.  Some years ago a Bill was enacted which set out to make leasing more acceptable to the farming community by getting rid of those provisions in the early Land Acts which might confer ownership rights on lessees.  I would be surprised to learn if this measure has had any success.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some statistics on an annual basis over, say, the past five years of long term leases that have been negotiated and the areas involved.  I was in the Seanad when that Bill was put through by former Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton.  We had great hope and we welcomed the Bill and acknowledged the great effort that Deputy Connaughton was making to get rid of the bottlenecks involved in the provisions of previous Land Acts.  We even referred the Bill to the social welfare code and removed blockages and disencouragement for farmers to lease their land.  We all thought this would be the answer but I am afraid I have not seen it operate to any significant effect.</P>
    <P>The sub-division of land is another matter that requires the attention of the Land Commission.  My experience is that some years ago it was very hard to obtain the consent of the Land Commission to split up a farm if that resulted in the creation of an uneconomic holding.  I have the impression now that the only <Col N="402" /> control on sub-division is a paper one and that consents, regardless of the type of sub-division involved, are automatic.  If this is the case we are going from one extreme to another.  While my misgivings may be unfounded, I would like to know whether control is exercised over sub-division at present.  As I said, in the past the Land Commission ensured that sub-division without a purpose did not take place.  However, after they have been abolished there will be nobody with a responsibility to control subdivision and it will be a free for all.</P>
    <P>Commonage division has always been regarded as an important function of the Land Commission.  The Land Acts contain elaborate provisions which set out the way in which commonages should be partitioned and that opposing parties can object and have their case heard by the commissioners in court.  If the commissioners dismiss the objection an appeal can be heard in the High Court. This happened recently when the High Court delivered a judgement in relation to a County Mayo commonage.  Some of the tenants concerned wanted the commonage to be divided but others wanted it to be retained as an open range.  These are complicated issues which require an intimate knowledge of law and involve court hearings where the parties can state whether they are for or against division. Commonage division will become an even more important function following the introduction of sheep quotas.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how all the matters I have mentioned will be handled after the Land Commission have been abolished. The intention is to transfer these functions to the Minister, who, I presume, would then delegate them to his officials. For the first time since the Land Commission were established therefore we will then have administrative officers whose function will be to deal with these matters, which at present are regarded as judicial or semi-judicial functions.  In relation to commonage cases, will the Minister have to appoint a new body which will be the equivalent of the Land Commission, either in the form of a board or an agency with the power to <Col N="403" /> hear and dispose of objections, or does he propose to retain control over commonage division and delegate this function to his officials?</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that other duties and functions are performed by the commissioners and that these will have to be performed, once the Bill has been passed, by someone acting in a judicial or a semi-judicial capacity.  I seek clarification on this matter, because it does not make sense to abolish one body if it will have to be replaced by another. Are there legal and constitutional issues which need to be thrashed out?  After all, one of the Articles of our Constitution speaks about the need to establish on the land, in economic security, as many families as is practicable.  The Minister's proposal that he should take over the functions and duties which are carried out at present by an independent body is questionable.  It has always been argued in the past that there are matters which are best kept out of the political arena.</P>
    <P>This is not a full and exhaustive list of the matters which will continue to be dealt with after the Land Commission have been abolished.  For example, there is the problem of high land annuities and the abnormal level of arrears, which are at present being considered by a departmental working party.  It seems that far reaching decisions will have to be taken in due course once the working party have concluded their deliberations.  Will land annuities be reduced or written off, or will the repayment period be extended, or will special arrangements be made to deal with arrears?  Other matters that will have to be settled include rights of way, turbary and grazing rights.  Will all these matters be taken under the Minister's wing?</P>
    <P>I have highlighted a sufficient number of problems and it is reasonable to ask whether there will be enough suitably qualified personnel around to deal with these matters after the Land Commission have been abolished.  Experience shows that the job of adjudicating on these issues is one for the experts, in this case the commissioners.  I presume after the <Col N="404" /> Land Commission have been abolished the commissioners will have to pack their bags and accept whatever other assignment is given to them.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the administrative officers, who will substitute for the commissioners, as they will have a very difficult task and they do not have the knowledge that the commissioners have acquired during the years.  I believe that we will face major problems after the Land Commission have been abolished if we do not take steps to deal with the problems that I have highlighted in my contribution so far.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, even though we do not have a worthwhile land structure policy, we should seriously consider introducing a land use policy, to which Deputy Boylan referred.  We have detailed planning provisions relating to urban development, but scarcely any relating to rural development.  This is significant in the context of forestry.  As Deputy Boylan mentioned, this is a major problem in rural areas.  It is estimated that between 500,000 and 600,000 acres of marginal agricultural land will be set aside for forestry during the next ten years or so.  This makes a massive change in relation to land use.  As pointed out in <i>The Farmers Journal</i> some months ago, this change has been made in the absence of any clear overall strategy.</P>
    <P>The question that needs to be answered is what way do we want to see the countryside look in, say, 30 to 40 years time.  Some local people are angry at the way in which forestry has been introduced in a townland.  They are concerned because they do not become aware that trees are going to be planted on a neighbouring farm until the machinery moves in.  I am aware of farmers who were leasing land and who suddenly discovered to their dismay that the land was to be planted without any offer being made to them to buy the land.  As I said at the outset, if they were able to buy this land they could make their holding more economic and so provide a living for the farmer and perhaps one of his sons.</P>
    <P>This problem will have to be addressed. Because this marks a change in <Col N="405" /> relation to land use they believe that they should be informed sooner so that they would be able to assess the impact on their livelihoods.  For example, a farm purchased for the purpose of planting trees may contain a certain amount of good arable land which a neighbouring farmer would like to buy to enlarge his own holding.  Another problem is that trees are planted is such a way that they isolate nearby houses by blocking the view.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that there is a clear need for a land use policy in this area.  In a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> the president of Macra na Feirme was quoted as saying in referring to the high cost involved in transferring land between members of the family:</P>
    <P>What we need is a land policy, an overall approach to the whole issue of land and land use in this country.  Land is our greatest asset, yet we have no overall policy for it.</P>
    <P>I have raised a number of important issues which need to be addressed.  I have also asked for information on a number of points which I hope will be provided when the Minister comes to reply.  I should say that I was impressed by his speech.  Having listened to him in the House on a number of occasions in the past, I am aware that he has a good grasp and understanding of the problems facing small farmers in rural Ireland.  For years people were crying out for the abolition of the Land Commission, but those same people are now asking what will we replace it with.  Many of the cynics are not around now to answer the question, but the small farmers and rural communities need something to replace it. There is a need for State intervention. While I am all in favour of private enterprise and allowing the forces of the free market to take their course, in regard to land there must be control and intervention. The small farmer with a small milk quota has no hope of competing for a patch of land with the farmer who has a substantial quota and has had money since the time of his grandfather.  The bigger farmers will gradually take over <Col N="406" /> any land that comes on offer.  I hope the Minister will address this issue in detail when replying.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the number of non-nationals coming into this country and taking over vast acres of Ireland in a totally uncontrolled way.  Nobody seems to worry about it.  I can point to large tracts of land between Kenmare, Sneem and Waterville in County Kerry that are now owned by non-nationals, people who come here for holidays, who give nothing to this country, who do not support local business and do not support the local schools.  These people come in undetected, with no restrictions on them, and acquire whatever land they wish.  These are matters we must address.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank Deputies, particularly Deputy Deenihan, for their congratulations and good wishes on my appointment.  I want to assure him and Deputies on all sides of the House of my availability to assist in any way I can in relation to the portfolio I now hold.</P>
      <P>I also wish to avail of this opportunity to thank the many Deputies who made a very significant contribution to the debate on this Bill.  I am glad to see that the reaction from the House has been one of general, if reluctant, acceptance that the time has come to wind up the Irish Land Commission and in so doing to close an important chapter in our social history.  I join with all of my colleagues who expressed their thanks and gratitude to the very many dedicated officials who served this country so well in the Land Commission.  In reality the main work of the commission, that of executing land settlement policy, came to an end in 1983 when land acquisitions ceased.  The effect of the passage of this Bill will be to formalise the situation which has existed on the ground for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that some Deputies took out of context my reference to land policy in my opening speech.  That reference was in the context of land acquisition policy, which is what is being dealt with <Col N="407" /> in this Bill and for which there is perhaps reluctant but general agreement both inside and outside the House.  There is, in my view, particularly in the context of the effects of European policy on Irish agriculture, a need for greater co-ordination of measures in relation to land use with a view to maximising the utilisation of our greatest national resource.  In this connection I would welcome the views of Deputies on all sides of the House.  I welcome the very constructive views expressed by Deputy Deenihan and other Deputies who spoke earlier.  I will deal with some of their points later.</P>
    <P>It is well to recall that the main purpose of the Land Commission policy over the years was the acquisition and redistribution of land for the purpose of creating economic agricultural holdings and the retention of the maximum number of farm families on the land of Ireland.  The Land Commission, broadly speaking, achieved that objective.  Deputies will agree that the term &ldquo;economic holding&rdquo; has changed significantly over the years, and even if we were to continue with a policy of land acquisition and redistribution we would in fact be seriously undermining our own stated social policy in this area, resulting in an increasing reduction in the number of family farms. There is obviously a conflict of interest between our aspirations to retain the maximum number of farm families on the land of Ireland and at the same time trying to retain a structure which would involve land acquisition.</P>
    <P>Following the termination of acquisition the whole question of controlling land sales with a view to channelling land into the hands of smallholders was examined in detail.  The outcome of this examination was that any proposal for such control would raise considerable constitutional and practical difficulties &mdash; constitutional because of implications for citizens' right to sell and acquire property and practical because of the problems inherent in deciding how to share out land coming onto the market among competing smallholders.  I am sure that Deputy Deenihan would recognise the <Col N="408" /> difficulties which would arise in the context of land distribution if we were to continue with that policy.  In this country land is a highly emotive issue and the majority of our farmers would not like to see curtailed their freedom to dispose of their property as they see fit.  Deputy Connaughton has said as much in his intervention and I bow to his experience in this area.</P>
    <P>In the end it was decided that the best way of preserving the family farm in the context of current Community policy on agriculture was not through the acquisition of additional land but by availing of one or more of the various EC backed measures that are in operation to assist farmers.  I will list some of these measures.  There is, first of all, the farm improvement programme.  Under this programme generous grants are available to farmers who under take planned investment in their enterprises.  Among the types of investment for which grants are available are land improvement, the erection of modern farm buildings and the provision of mobile equipment. Grant aid under this programme is now running at over £20 million per year.</P>
    <P>Allied to the farm improvement programme is the scheme for the control of farmyard pollution.  This is aimed at the smaller farmer who wants to undertake basic investment to prevent pollution from farm waste.  Grants of between 50 per cent and 55 per cent are available for buildings and storage facilities for fodder and slury.  Since this scheme was introduced in 1989, 25,000 projects have been approved with a grant aid of £94 million.</P>
    <P>Under the young farmers installation scheme, young farmers who are being installed on a farm for the first time and who meet certain conditions are entitled to a special grant of £5,600.  Nearly 2,000 farmers have availed of this grant since 1986 at a cost of over £11 million to the Exchequer.  In addition they are entitled to an extra 25 per cent on investment grants under the various farm improvement schemes.  We will continue to keep this scheme under review to ensure that it is making the maximum contribution to expediting land transfer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> Yesterday I met with the president and other representatives of Macra na Feirme, an organisation for whom I have tremendous respect, and I shared with them, and they with me, views in relation to the problem of land transfer and how best we can expedite the transfer of land from older to younger farmers.  They had some very interesting views to put before me and I will take these views into consideration in formulating new policy in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of what the headage payments mean to farm incomes in the disadvantaged areas.  These areas now comprise 72 per cent of the country and the amount to be paid out this year is close on £100 million.  That is big money by any standard.</P>
    <P>Under the rural development programme incentives are available for a wide range of projects aimed at stimulating economic activity in rural areas. Among these projects are alternative enterprises such as deer, goats, horses, agri-tourism and, the most recent introduction, the Leader programme.  A coordinated approach to rural development is essential if we are to get maximum benefit from this programme.  Deputy Deenihan in his contribution acknowledged the need for overall co-ordination of the schemes which apply to the development of agriculture and other areas in rural Ireland.  To this end a monitoring committee comprising representatives of the Department, the EC and various interest groups have been set up and given overall responsibility for the implementation of the various schemes.</P>
    <P>In terms of agriculture, our priority is and must be, the development and consolidation of the core industry, which is the production and processing of food, including animal husbandry.  We would, however, be foolish to close our eyes to the limiting effects of EC policies on this important aspect of the industry and to the possibility of developing alternative enterprises.</P>
    <P>Our success will depend on our ability and capacity to develop under every available heading enterprises which will contribute to economic and social <Col N="410" /> development and help to resolve our worrying and unacceptable unemployment level.  We are being assisted in this task by the provision of special EC funding under the programme for integrated rural development and other associated schemes.</P>
    <P>It is now my responsibility to assist in the implementation of these programmes and to work in close co-operation with local communities in the implementation of their development programmes.  In assuring them of my utmost help and support, I appeal to all concerned to assist in maximising to the greatest extent possible, the potential for national development which these funds make possible.  The success of these programmes will be a major deciding factor in relation to the availability of further EC funding and with good management will certainly have a tremendous impact on our overall economic development.  In the future it will be a question of farming the entire land resource as distinct from traditional farming patterns.  It is an interesting challenge which we cannot afford to ignore because, properly developed, these schemes should make a significant contribution to the economic viability of what are once again becoming agriculturally uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>More than ever, it is a question of integrating our existing network of small farms with a new and, I hope, successful programme for integrated rural development. It is socially desirable to retain the maximum number of farm families on the land.  That view has been expressed by almost every Member of the House who contributed to this debate.  We tend to talk too much about structures and not enough about people, but structures must be about people.  We cannot have a successful rural development programme without people.  In terms of agri-tourism we need people to deliver the service. We need them to personalise our special attraction as a tourist nation.  The unique charm of our people, combined with our still unspoilt environment, is one of our greatest assets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the provision of grant aid for land drainage.  In <Col N="411" /> deciding on grant applications environmental considerations were always taken into account.  Where the land involved had an environmental dimension, applications were granted only where the wildlife service gave their approval.</P>
    <P>A new scheme has just been launched for the pretection of environmentally sensitive areas.  Two areas have been chosen on a pilot basis for the introduction of this scheme, the Slieve Blooms in Laois-Offaly and Slyne Head in County Galway.  Under the scheme a farmer can get up to £1,000 for following farm practices that are aimed at protecting and enhancing the environment. Deputy Deasy referred to the policy of the Department in giving grants to farmers who would drain wetland.</P>
    <P>These are the main structural measures at present available to assist Irish agriculture. Others are likely to follow from the adoption of the current proposals for the reform of Common Agricultural Policy.  I accept that agriculture is going through a somewhat difficult period at the moment.  Farmers have had to face similar if not greater difficulties before and have survived.  I have no reason to think they will not do the same again. Indeed, with the range of support measures now available they should be able to face the future with greater confidence. I know there is considerable concern about the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and about the ongoing negotiations on GATT, but we as a Government are totally committed to ensuring that we get the best possible deal for Irish farmers and for Ireland generally from the negotiations.</P>
    <P>Last week I met Commissioner Ray MacSharry in Brussels and discussed with him the serious difficulties facing Irish farmers in terms of declining income.  We discussed the advantages which would emanate from the increasing level of grants which will be available from Europe for structural development.  The Commissioner agreed fully with me that our only hope of supplementing declining income for small farmers is to initiate integrated rural development programmes <Col N="412" /> which would support off-farm employment so as to boost the income of farmers who, because of the size of their holdings and restrictions on production, are not able to make a decent living.  Our farmers are committed to working.  It is in their nature to work their farms.  It is alien to the nature of Irish farmers to depend on social support.  I hope the new structural programmes we are now putting in place will provide a worthwhile incentive to farmers to supplement their incomes from off-farm employment.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that there is a case for setting up any sort of statutory body in relation to land control.  I take the points which Deputy Deenihan made in his contribution.  The matter will be kept under review and if in future it emerges that there is a tendency to accumulate too much land in the hands of too few people, the question of some regulatory authority could be considered.  There is no evidence of such a development and later I will provide the House with statistics on land transfers.</P>
    <P>In discussing the question of a land authority some Deputies are thinking of a body which would have overall control of regulating the use to which land is put, to ensure the best use of our greatest national resource.  This is clearly a matter for consideration in the context of a new development programme for agriculture and food which is being negotiated as a result of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement.  I take on board the views which have been expressed by Deputies from all sides of the House, that there is a need for some alternative structure to deal with the land problems which remain following the dissolution of the Land Commission.  It would be wrong to move hastily towards the establishment of such a body, particularly in view of the fact that all sectors, including the agricultural sector, the Department, EC officials and other people, are all involved in the discussions which are taking place.  If they bring forward proposals requiring the establishment of a monitoring authority, that is a matter which can be considered when that report is put before the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> The abolition of the Land Commission will not mean that all the functions performed by that body will disappear. Much of the work carried out by the commission at present will be continued under the power retained and transferred to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to promote group purchase and leasing of land, as well as providing assistance in the rearrangement of fragmented holdings and in the division and disposal of commonages. Other continuing functions include the disposal of land on hands, the exercise of control over subdivision of holdings and the purchase of land by non-qualified persons, the collection of annuities and the settling of title.</P>
    <P>In view of the level of interest expressed by the Deputies in these activities, a brief comment on them is called for.  Some years ago as recalled by Deputy Connaughton and Deputy Deenihan the Department introduced the idea of group purchase of land.  This involved encouraging local smallholders to get together to buy land which came on the market in their locality.  The Land Commission helped with mapping, sub-division and legal formalities.  The practice will be continued by the Department.</P>
    <P>Yesterday when I met representatives of Macra na Feirme I suggested that they should give further consideration to promoting the concept of group purchase. When a holding becomes available in a local area, very often it is not financially possible for an individual farmer to acquire that land to increase his holding. The group purchase scheme has merit, and organisations like Macra na Feirme could assist in promoting the concept to enable existing small farmers to increase their holdings.  The people to whom I spoke yesterday agreed to consider that view.</P>
    <P>Long or medium term leasing has for some time been recognised and promoted as being potentially the most rewarding method of getting land into the hands of those who will use it effectively without the need for the high capital outlay involved in purchasing a farm. With the guaranteed use of the land for <Col N="414" /> a stated number of years, lessees can plan their enterprises in a rational way without uncertainty of renewal from year to year. Lessors, on the other hand, are assured of a guaranteed income and do not run the same risk of having their land exploited, as can happen only too frequently with the traditional 11-month system.  Certain exceptions are available in respect of leasing income obtained from leases of at least five years duration by lessors who are aged 55 years or over or who are incapacitated.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Social Welfare Act changed the system of assessing income under the Social Welfare code which previously discriminated against leasing.  Income from leasing is now assessed in the same way as income from letting land on the 11-month system.</P>
    <P>In the review of the installation aid scheme recently announced, young farmers can now qualify for the installation grant in respect of leased land.  This should give an added boost to leasing. I discussed this matter with Macra na Feirme.</P>
    <P>Commonage division is clearly close to the heart of a number of Deputies, particularly those from the western counties.  I am happy to confirm that the commonage division service will continue in one form or another.  Land held in common is generally neglected and only realising a fraction of its potential.</P>
    <P>The court case mentioned by Deputies refers to an appeal to the judicial commissioner by a group of shareholders in County Mayo against a compulsory scheme of division prepared by the Land Commission.  Work on other compulsory division cases was for the most part suspended pending the outcome of this case. The judgment has since been delivered and is now being studied to assess its implications for compulsory commonage division in future.  The case has no implications for voluntary divisions and they have continued apace.  Between 1988 and 1990 118 commonages, covering almost 8,000 hectares, were divided between 649 shareholders.  The suggestion made by Deputy Connaughton that farmers could accelerate the process of division by <Col N="415" /> employing their own engineer is one which merits further consideration.</P>
    <P>The important question of annuities is generating much interest among farmers. Nearly all Deputies referred to this matter.  I share the concerns expressed. Deputies will be aware that a working group was set up to examine how best to tackle this very important matter.  They have reported and their findings are under urgent consideration in the Department.  It was one of the first files for which I asked following my appointment. I will do everything possible to ensure a satisfactory resolution of the problems of farmers who are experiencing such great difficulty.  As a rural Deputy I am aware of the difficulties of smaller farmers, in particular in paying Land Commission annuities.  I am satisfied that the working group put a great deal of effort into analysing the problems faced by these farmers.  I will continue to do my best to seek a satisfactory resolution.</P>
    <P>Time does not allow me to deal with the other activities of the Land Commission which have been retained within the Department relating to vesting, the sale of land to non-nationals and the disposal of remaining lands.  About 2,500 hectares of agricultural land remain to be allocated, together with approximately 5,000 hectares of bog.  We are proceeding as fast as we can to dispose of this land and hope to complete the task during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I wish once again to pay a well-deserved tribute to the officials of the Land Commission who over the years did such a satisfactory job on behalf of farmers.  Farmers in almost every county have benefited from their work.  It is against all the rules to this House to refer to civil servants by name, but I want to acknowledge the presence here today of Mr. Dom Duggan, one of the veterans of Land Commission policy, who has made such a very significant contribution as an important member of the Land Commission. The rules should be broken to give well-deserved recognition to a very <Col N="416" /> important man within the overall structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations in the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group (Culliton report) relating to competition in telecommunications services propose that competition to Telecom Éireann be allowed in the provision of value-added services and that resale of leased lines be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as competition in value-added services is concerned, on 3 March 1992 I signed a statutory instrument (S.I. No. 45 of 1992) which enables me to issue licences for value-added services.  I might add that my predecessor informed the Dáil during Question Time on 26 November 1991 that no action would be taken under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, against those who provide value-added <Col N="417" /> services in advance of the making of this statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>In relation to the resale of leased lines, EC Directive 90/388 on competition in the markets for telecommunications services provides for prohibition on resale of leased lines until the end of 1992 with the possibility of an extension of this prohibition until the end of 1995.  I would not be prepared to approve of resale until Telecom Éireann's tariffs are brought more into line with their costs.  At present Telecom Éireann's charges for long distance and international calls are too high while the charges for local calls in many cases do not meet the costs of these calls. Approval in resale of leased line capacity would encourage, cream skimming and arbitrage and, by eating into Telecom Éireann's profitable area, would reduce the company's capacity to provide a universal service based on the most up to date technology.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of approaches to my Department regarding the possibility of providing telecommunications services in competition with Telecom Éireann and the Deputy will understand why the interested parties would expect me to treat details of their approaches as confidential.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, progress with the establishment of MMDS in a number of areas had, until the latter part of 1991, been delayed by the planning process. MMDS systems are now operational or are under construction in nine of the ten franchised areas of the country.  The provision of MMDS service to specific areas within the MMDS franchise is a matter for the licensed operator concerned.  If it emerges that satisfactory service is not possible in an area from a licensee's primary transmitter, technical solutions for the provision of service unique to each such area will have to devised by the licensee with consequent unavoidable delays in the provision of service to these areas.</P>

What is the Minister's policy in this regard, particularly considering that, for example, in her own county 6,000 homes receive television signals via these deflectors?</P>

      <P>Action has begun on the implementation of the provision of the MMDS service to areas whose only possibility of receiving this kind of service up to now has been the illegal deflector system.  The Deputy is right in that in my own area that system was operated on a large scale.  As the MMDS system has come on stream, more and more people in each of the areas are opting for that system and, consequently, there is a reduction in the number of customers using the illegal deflector system.  It is my policy, as it was the policy of each Minister before me, that no illegal deflector system should be licensed.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there are adequate powers available to deal with malpractices of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  A person who makes telephone calls of an offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing character or who persistently makes calls without reasonable cause or for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety can be prosecuted in the courts and, if convicted, shall be liable to a fine of up to £50,000 or to imprisonment <Col N="421" /> for up to five years or to both the fine and imprisonment.  Telecom Éireann also have the power to suspend service to any subscriber who uses the phone for making obscene or menacing calls.

While there are laws and penalties on the Statute Book, they do not seem to be sufficient.  Would the Minister consider introducing a 24-hour freephone helpline, similar to that operating in Britain and Northern Ireland, which would give recorded advice to people in terror and desperation?</P>

      <P>I will pass on to the chief executive and board of Telecom Éireann the Deputy's suggestion relating to the provision of a 24-hour freephone service for people in this position. Having been the subject of this type of telephone call in Dublin, and my family having been subject to it in my home in Galway, in 1989 I can well appreciate the distress this causes in a home.  I am acutely aware and, in fairness to Telecom Éireann, I think Telecom Éireann are also acutely aware of the problem.  When instances of that kind of abusive and threatening phone calls have been brought to their attention they have reacted immediately and worked with the law enforcement authorities to ensure, so far as is possible, that they first get the proof and then, when proof is found, that prosecution follows.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that a large number of those calls are not recorded and that many of them are not reported to the Garda, either through <Col N="422" /> fear or because of the feeling that nothing will or can be done?  Would she agree that some publicity on this matter, possibly centred on the provision of the helpline I have suggested, would enable determination of the enormity of this problem which might itself be useful?  On a lighter note, perhaps now would be a good time to act in this respect because the malicious phone calls referred to by the Minister could, in fact, increase in the near future in the light of certain political developments taking place, if the past is anything to go by.</P>

Secondly, I agree with the Deputy that it is very important to publicise the fact that Telecom Éireann and the law enforcement authorities activate all of their facilities immediately on a complaint being made to them.  Perhaps the fact that the Deputy has tabled this question today will encourage members of the news media who report the proceedings of this House to bring it to the attention of the public.  However, as I said earlier, I will raise with Telecom Éireann the possibility of further publicity, whether by way of a freephone helpline or otherwise.</P>

I put it to her that some consider it to be crucial cornerstone for the development of broadcasting and that it does not seem to get the same regard from the Government. I ask the Minister why the Directive was translated into a statutory instrument only and whether or not any future broadcasting policy of legislation from the Government will address the provisions of the Directive?  Does the Minister accept that the Directive merely sets down a minimum and that what she, in consultation with RTE, should now have surpassed the minimum and be moving more rapidly towards the objective of the British broadcasting agencies of a 25 per cent content of independently produced broadcasts?  In summation, do I take it that it is the Minister's attitude simply to pass the Directive into a statutory instrument and then forget about it, or will she take an active role as Minister to encourage a working together by RTE and the independents to achieve development of a joint market in this regard?</P>

      <P>I remind the Minister that the House cannot have a debate on this issue.

      <P>The requirement is that EC Directives be implemented into national law.  I understand that the implementation of this Directive could be done, and it was the proper way to do it, by the provision of a statutory instrument.  That is why it was done that way.</P>
      <P>While I do not have a role in the day-to-day operational matters of RTE, I most certainly do have a role &mdash; an active role, as the Deputy said &mdash; in encouraging RTE to move in the general direction that the UK market has moved.  It would be in everyone's interest, and I hope that everyone would share the view, that the more programming of a European nature we have and the more encouragement given to the independents from the national network the better it is, not only on the jobs front but also in the interests of general competition, in the kind of programming we get and in better selection for viewers all around the country.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that airlines operating from Ireland appear to be operating a cartel by reason of the fact that their fare structures and conditions of various types appear to be identical; if she will outline her views on such activity from the point of view of the Competition Act and as a matter of policy generally; whether she proposes to take any action in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All the international routes to/from Ireland on which Irish carriers compete with foreign carriers are intra-Community routes and services operated on such routes must conform with Community law.  Under the provisions of EC Council Regulation No. 2342/90, member states are required to permit Community air carriers of other member states to match air fares already approved for scheduled air services on routes between Ireland and other EC member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Air fares are also subject to the competition rules of the EC Treaty.  EC Council Regulation No. 3976/87, as amended, exempts from the application of the competition rules of the Treaty, consultations between airlines on fares and the conditions applying to such fares. Such consultations must not, however, exceed the lawful purpose of facilitating interlining, which is generally recognised as being of benefit both to the consumer and the industry.  The conditions under which such fares consultations take place are set down in Commission Regulation 84/91 and officials from the Commission regularly attend such consultations.  Participation <Col N="427" /> by air carriers in such consultations is voluntary.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that fares filed with me by carriers serving Ireland conform to the provision of Community rules and are not inconsistent with the terms of the Competition Act.</P>
    <P>My Department do not control fares on non-scheduled air services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, whatever may be the Community rules, the position on the ground facing the consumer is that a cartel operates, that identical rules and regulations apply in the case of all airlines, whether it be Aer Lingus, British Midlands, Ryanair or whoever?  One must remain outside the country for a Saturday night and return for the £72 or £78, all of these fares are absolutely identical.  They are operating a cartel and there is no competition between them.  Is the Minister satisfied with that position or does she intend to do anything about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is a cartel in place between airlines operating to and from this country.  It has to be recognised that it is a legitimate, competitive response by an airline to match a fare or other fares of another competitor.  Perhaps to a greater extent now than ever before there is considerable competition, particularly on the Dublin/London route.  I hope the Deputy would support interlining between airlines as something which affects the customer and is of tremendous benefit to travellers between both countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to say that I disagree with the Minister's view that there is no cartel.  Is the Minister not aware that there are very complex rules and regulations, so complex they are comparable to the social welfare legislation or the income tax code, with a great variety of fares applicable on the same route?  All the airlines that operate them do so under the exact same provisions? I agree with interlining, but that is a separate matter.  One may be <Col N="428" /> matching the fares of another, but clearly they are operating in concert, not only with identical fares but under absolutely identical regulations in all respects. Surely that is not something the Government can accept, because it is anti-consumer and costing the consumer considerably more than is appropriate, particularly on the Dublin/London route.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would agree with me that Deputy Taylor is talking rubbish in so far as all European airlines are losing a fortune, that within the current three-year period Aer Lingus are losing £100 million in transport.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of air fares and structures raised, the Minister will be aware that her predecessor received a submission in relation to Dublin/London fare structures to change the approval procedures on what is the most competitive route in the whole of the European Community?  Is she prepared to allow quicker procedures in relation to fare changes and structures on the Dublin/London route as has been requested?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that on the North Atlantic route, whether it be as a result of a cartel or not, there is no competition since only Delta and Aer Lingus fly on that route.  Would the Minister agree with me that a Competition Act without competition is not worth anything?  Furthermore, would she agree that she needs to open up the skies to Aer Lingus, allowing them to fly directly, in competition with Ryanair, into <Col N="429" /> Luton and Stansted Airports?  In addition, would she agree that to encourage competition Aer Lingus and other American airlines should be allowed to fly directly in and out of Dublin, thereby allowing greater competition which does not obtain?  Would she agree that the reason there are artificial cartels operating is because of the restrictive legislative framework in which airlines fly between England and Ireland and over the North Atlantic?</P>

      <P>On the North Atlantic, there is a further question later on that matter when I might deal with the Deputy's supplementary.</P>
      <P>On the Dublin/London route, in reply to an earlier question in relation to the Government's policy, or the two-airline policy the Government have been operating and which will be operational up to the end of 1992, I said I was in favour of that policy continuing until the end of 1992, that I was now in the process of reviewing that policy and hoped to be in a position to let both Aer Lingus and Ryanair know my decision in relation to that well in advance of their preparing their schedules for next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> As the House will be aware, the Government have decided that the Air Navigation Services Office (ANSO) of my Department will be established as a commercial semi-State body.  The intention is that the new body will, with certain ecceptions, operate along similar lines to the Civil Aviation Authority in the United Kingdom.  Legislation will be necessary to establish the new body and I hope to be in a position to introduce a Bill to deal with the matter in the forthcoming session.</P>
    <P>At European level the current strategy is aimed at harmonising the work of the various national air traffic services in a way that will facilitate traffic and appear to the users as a single system.  I am pleased to say that we in Ireland have the equipment and systems to participate fully in the European harmonized air traffic system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I might point out that Questions Nos. 7 and 11 deal with separate matters.</P>
      <P>In relation to a European single air traffic control system, is the Minister, or Minister of State aware that it has been calculated at European level that to have a single system right across the Community would reduce air fares by some 8 per cent?  Will the Minister therefore give a commitment on behalf of the Irish Government that when such a proposal comes before the Council of Transport Ministers the Government will support such a proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>When that arises we will certainly look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister of State will look at it, but that was not my question.  My question was whether our Government had given this any thought and whether they were aware of how much the multiplicity of different regimes costs the Community both in term of air traffic control and air space?  In this context is the Minister aware that Irish air traffic control system is one of the most expensive in Europe and that to overfly British air space is <Col N="431" /> also one of the most costly exercises in Europe?  For those reasons would he agree that Ireland has a vested interest, more than anyone else, in ensuring that a single air traffic control system obtains?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>At present Ireland is a member of EURO control, the European body for the co-ordination of air traffic control measures.  We are working toward harmonisation in that regard.  It is difficult to comment further before firm proposals are placed before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 11, a separate one, what I sought from the Minister was a similar authority here as that in Britain, where their Civil Aviation Authority can independentaly evaluate and investigate all matters in relation to aviation.  At present these matters are investigated by the Department only.  I realise a semi-State body have been set up to examine the hardware aspects of flying planes in and out of airports and control procedures.  I am talking about an independent civil aviation authority who would investigate and analyse aviation issues, competition between airlines, cartels and transatlantic flights. This independent authority could also comment on issues such as airport charges.  Such a system has worked very well in Britain.  It is separate to the ATC issue.  Will the Minister give a commitment to set up a civil aviation authority in Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>Within the past four years substantial improvements have been carried out at Cork airport involving expenditure of £16 million. There has been direct investment by the Department in the provision of radar and air navigational equipment at the airport at a cost of £6 million.  A further £10 million has been spent by Aer Rianta on extending the terminal building and the main runway.</P>
      <P>Future plans for the continued development of the airport include an investment this year of £1 million in improving the catering facilities &mdash; work to commence immediately &mdash; and upgrading car parking facilities.  A further £6 million is projected in 1993 to cover improvements to the terminal buildings, an overlay of the runway and an expansion of cargo facilities at the airport.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta expect traffic at the airport to grow by 3 per cent this year from a base of 650,000 in 1991.  By 1996 Aer Rianta foresee a growth in traffic of 12 per cent over the 1992 performance. Further development of UK provincial routes is forecast by Aer Rianta. Increased air service capacity on the Cork-Bristol-Plymouth routes this year is anticipated while the Cork-Birmingham service will continue.  Aer Rianta are hoping there will be direct services to Manchester in 1993.</P>

I am glad the <Col N="433" /> Minister has good news for me.  In view of the fact that Cork is the centre of the south-west, our premier tourist area, does the Minister agree it is important that continued emphasis should be placed on the development of the airport?

A detailed investigation into the circumstances surrounding the mid-air collision between two training aircraft in the Cork area in February last is being carried out by accident inspectors from the air navigation services office in my Department.</P>
      <P>All personnel involved in offering flying training are required to hold the appropriate licences and be rated as flight instructors on such licences.  Flying schools are not licensed <i>per se</i>.

The flying school whose aircraft were involved in the accident is working towards obtaining official approval.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy and the House that the operations of flying schools, whether approved or otherwise, together with their staffs and pupils, are continuously and closely monitored by the technical staff of my Department.  Particular attention is also paid to the need to ensure that training aircraft avoid flying over built-up areas as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Should the investigations to which I have referred reveal the need for any changes or improvements in any procedures or practices in these schools, or in the general conduct of light aircraft training, then I can assure the House that the necessary action will be promptly taken.</P>

      <P>A constituent of mine lost his life in this tragic accident.  There have been two other accidents involving light aircraft.  Is the Minister satisfied with the general safety procedures for such flights?  Will he briefly outline those procedures to the House?  Do they need to be improved in view of the recent loss of life in these accidents so as to ensure that planes do not come into contact with each other?  This cannot happen in the case of commercial airlines because there is air traffic control.</P>

One accident occurred in the Wicklow mountains while another occurred in Cork.  In one instance, two aircraft flew into each other.  This is unacceptable.  I asked the Minister to outline briefly the current safety procedures and to say whether he had any proposals to improve or review them.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's reply.  It is similar to the reply given by a spokesperson for the Minister in a newspaper article.  When asked whether the training school was licensed the spokesperson replied: &ldquo;It would be unfair to say the school was unapproved. It was not fully approved.  There are aspects which are acceptable to the Department but there are some aspects that are not&rdquo;.  Do these training schools have to abide by specific rules and regulations and work to certain guidelines?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the company whose employees lost their lives in Cork lost an instructor and student pilot in similar circumstances when the company were located in Ashbourne?  The company moved to Cork because of the congested airways over Dublin airport.  Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that he will sharpen the procedures followed by these flying schools? Will he give a guarantee that flying schools will not be allowed to overfly urban and built-up areas?</P>

      <P>I must emphasise that there is absolutely no question whatsoever of a flying school being unapproved. All personnel involved in the provision of flight training are required to have the appropriate licences and to be rated for flight instruction purposes.  I can assure the Deputy that the personnel <Col N="437" /> involved in this accident were licensed and rated as required.  The Deputy said that this accident was similar to a previous accident.  This pre-empts the outcome of the investigation which is currently being carried out.  I will have to await the outcome of the investigation before I can comment on this accident.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that all the funding under the EC structural funded operational programme for tourism has now been allocated and that there remains applications from hundreds of projects that have had to be refused; and if she intends to seek further funding from the Commission in order that these applications can be dealt with before the end of this year.</Quest>

      <P>Bord Fáilte, and SFADCo in the case of the mid-west have been designated by the EC as the agencies responsible for evaluating, and approving applications for European <Col N="438" /> Regional Development Fund grant aid under the operational programme for tourism.</P>
      <P>I understand from the agencies that, while funds provided for eligible work by public or similar bodies are now almost fully committed for projects due for completion by end of 1993, applications are still being accepted for privately funded developments.</P>
      <P>Further EC funding is unlikely to become available during the life of the current programme.  Discussions have been initiated with the EC about Structural Funds for Ireland post-1993 and the question of further funding for tourism will be considered in the context of the Community Support Framework to be agreed for Ireland for the period 1994 to 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the operational programme for tourism negotiated by her predecessor has been a complete failure?  There have been about 350 applications under the agri-tourism scheme but letters of approval have been issued to only 145 applicants; 122 are, supposedly, under consideration and about 25 have been approved.  There are hundreds more applications which come to Bord Fáilte or SFADCo and which we do not know about.  Incidentally, I do not have figures in relation to SFADCo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The total investment under the operational programe for tourism will amount to £300 million at 1989 prices.  Out of that, £118.4 million comes from the European Regional Development Fund and the rest &mdash; £28.5 million &mdash; comes from the ESF. I do not think that a Government, or an <Col N="439" /> agency on their behalf, could possibly find the huge levels of money in excess of that, would have been necessary to cater for every single application.  This is the first time we have had an operational programme for tourism.  If we did not have it we would not have been able to afford from Exchequer funding the kind of developments aided under the operational programme.  When it comes to an end in 1993 we are most hopeful that there will be a fresh operational programme for tourism.  If and how that happens depends on the negotiations which will start at the end of this year, with the European Commission working towards an increase in the level of funding for tourism under the European Regional Development Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, to say the very least, her Department grossly under-estimated the response to this scheme, which was a great mistake?  Will she give some hope to at least 25 applications with which I know Bord Fáilte are dealing and have approved?  The amount involved is £2.245 million.  Can she give any word of comfort or hope to those 25 applicants?</P>

      <P>In relation to the operational programme as it stands, Bord Fáilte and SFADCo are the agencies who first get the applications, assess them and make decisions in relation to them.  The Department have no role in any of those areas, their only role being co-ordinating and monitoring the way in which the funds are spent and how quickly they are spent.  Bord Fáilte and SFADCo make the decisions and, as I said, under the operational programme a <Col N="440" /> sum of £300 million is available, £28.5 million from the ESF and the rest under the European Regional Development Fund.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's remarks cause me great concern because he seems to be telling me that Bord Fáilte and SFADCo &mdash; or one of them &mdash; sent out letters of approval to applicants where there is no money to meet that approval.  That is a serious matter which I intend to raise with the chairman and chief executive of Bord Fáilte.  It would not be normal business practice, in any instance, for a letter of approval of a grant to be sent to an applicant where there was no money to pay that grant.  I will certainly investigate that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of what the Minister said a moment ago about her Department's role in monitoring and overseeing the application of these schemes, will she give consideration to the procedure in a number of cases where applicants received oral approval of a project but who found, when the paper work had all been gone through, that it had been turned down or declassified on the basis that there was no further funding for it?  Will the Minister tighten that part of the scheme to prevent such misunderstandings which are most unfair to applicants?  Will the Minister also look at the kind of investment appraisal techniques applied by Bord Fáilte to these cases, because I am sure other Deputies have, like myself, come across cases where business plans approved by banks &mdash; God knows the banks look for strong guarantees &mdash; have been turned <Col N="441" /> down by the investment analysts of Bord Fáite without a reason for a different view being taken?  Will the Minister undertake to look into those aspects of the scheme because it may be that projects which deserve funding are not getting it as a result of those deficiencies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can explain to Deputy Connor what I meant.  I was not misleading the House.  Projects have been approved for aid under the operational programme for tourism and they cannot be completed within a period of six months or one year; they are mostly in relation to projects over a number of years.  That is why I said that the £300 million for the operational programme for tourism is spread over a five-year period for a whole range of different projects. It would be very easy for me to say that of course more money might be available or that I will see if more money is available.  However, I am trying to be as frank and open as I can.  I do not see the possibility of the European Community giving us extra funding under this operational programme, because the figures were laid down for five years and they are not open to change within that period.  In the autumn we will begin to work with the various directors general of the Commission to ensure that we have a followup operational programme on tourism post-1993.  My objective will be to look for increased funding for this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> includes proposals for expenditure of £36 million on public transport which is being implemented with financial assistance from the EC under the Operational Programme on Peripherality.  The operational programme is scheduled to be implemented by the end of 1993.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure to date amounts to approximately £1 million which includes investment in the development of the Dublin-Maynooth commuter line including the provision of four new stations on the line.  Preliminary expenditure has also been incurred in relation to the provision of new rail freight gantries at Cork, Dundalk, Limerick and Sligo.  Work in relation to the provision of these gantries is continuing and I expect it to be completed by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>A number of other public transport projects is also being considered for assistance under the Operational Programme on Peripherality.  These projects include the provision of commuter rail services on the south west corridor, including Clondalkin, upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast railway line, some preliminary work on the restoration of the Harcourt Street line and the development of a rail link to the Belview Harbour development at Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planned expenditure on these projects between now and the end of 1993 is such as to secure a full draw-down of the European Regional Development Fund allocation for public transport projects under <Col N="444" /> the Operational Programme on Peripherality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the view held by those who work in the public transport system that the Government's performance in identifying projects for funding and then securing funding for them under the European Regional Development Fund was appallingly poor when compared with some other capital cities, particularly Athens?  Does the Minister accept that one of the major factors contributing to the appalling public transport system in Dublin is the lack of initiative on the part of the Government in pursuing funding from the European Regional Development Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that the record of this Government, or former Governments, has been appalling in relation to public transport.</P>
      <P>We must be clear that moneys from the European Regional Development Fund cover two aspects of transport: roads infrastructure and development and public transport, to which these questions refer, namely mainline and commuter rail services.  Since I became Minister I have been looking at ways I can prioritise my objectives or, in other words, to minimise the differences between the two. We all recognise that money from the Regional Fund was spent on our road network, where it was so badly needed.</P>
      <P>In preparing for the review of the Delors mark II and in making submissions for money from the Structural Fund post-1993 I will be looking specifically at what special aid might be available to us for the rail network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that Deputy McCartan is correct because in the 1989-93 programme the total amount made available was £818 million but less than 4 per cent, £36 million, went to public transport?  This was the lowest in the EC and that was shameful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has outlined where this £36 million may be spent, the rail link to the Belview Harbour development at <Col N="445" /> Waterford, the Harcourt Street line and the Clondalkin line but will she agree that £36 million will not cover all those projects?  Would she also agree that it would be more honest and direct to say where this money will go because it has been over promised to too many projects? Will the Minister say which routes will not get money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can be accused of over promising anything. I have been approximately six weeks in the job and I have been looking at public transport in so far as it is my responsibility.  In that period I have pushed forward a number of projects that were awaiting decision.</P>
      <P>Any expenditure on the rail service, whether mainline rail, the commuter services or the Dublin-Belfast line, first requires approval from the Government and second, but almost at the same time, from the EC for grant-aid under the European Regional Development Fund. I have been moving very quickly on both fronts.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McCartan, I do not think it is correct to say that our draw down of EC funds has been appalling. The difficulty was that successive Governments decided that the moneys from the ERD should be put into our road network.  The rail network suffered because it did not get the same level of priority.  In the coming weeks and months I will raise the order of priority of the rail system, whether commuter, the Dublin-Belfast line or mainline rail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister be a little more specific on how the £36 million will be allocated?  We have been embarrassed by the enthusiasm of the Northern Ireland railway board who want to update the Dublin-Belfast line and found us sadly lacking.  How much money will be spent in the preparation of a light rail infrastructure throughout Dublin city? What proportion of the £36 million will be spent on the upgrading of the Dublin-Sligo line on which trains are now travelling no faster than 40 miles per hour?  Those three projects are in need <Col N="446" /> of urgent capital injections.  Will the Minister outline her plans for these services?</P>
      <P>It is proposed to convert the Harcourt Street line into a busway but does the Minister propose to make this a light rail line?  How much money will be spent on building a light rail system for Dublin city as compared to the expenditure on busways?</P>

      <P>First, I wish to refer to the proposed light rail system and the Harcourt Street line.  The only Government decision in relation to the Harcourt Street line was one in principle. Second, no decision has yet been taken to follow up that decision in principle by providing a busway or a light rail system. My opinion, for what it is worth, is that the system that would work most effectively, efficiently and would encourage people to leave their cars at home and use public transport would be a light rail system.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Dublin-Sligo line, this is, as the Deputy is aware, a separate issue from the Dublin-Belfast line or from commuter lines because it is a mainline and we have no commitment from the EC as of yet to assist any mainline rail developments.  In relation to the Dublin-Belfast line, may I remind the Deputy that we were not embarrassed by our neighbours in the North.</P>

      <P>The Minister states it is a matter for the Government to appoint; it is a matter for Government because this House gave the authority to the Government to do so.  Does the Minister accept that under the 1976 Act, section 4 makes it mandatory that not later than 31 March 1977 a commission shall be established by Government and that there is no scope or opportunity for &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; or whatever, about this?  Can the Minister explain, given the mandatory nature of the legislation, why we have been without a complaints commission for 12 months?  Given the small number of personnel that need to be appointed to that commission can she offer any explanation as to what difficulties have existed?  Does the Minister not accept that the absence of this commission, in addition to being totally in breach of positive duty in the legislation, is denying the public a democratic opportunity to have a say in the way in which current affairs, news, advertising and a range of other matters are presented on our national airwaves and is she happy with the situation?</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there was any specific reason why they were not reappointed.  I am in the process of making a recommendation to Government for their reappointment as soon as possible.  In relation to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, it is important to point out that their function is only in a case where a person makes a complaint to the RTE Authority and the response received from the RTE Authority is unsatisfactory.  The person may then make recommendations to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should reflect a little on the commitment for open Government.  While she carries no <Col N="450" /> personal responsibility for the appalling state of affairs she should be prepared to advise the House as to why we are now into the 13th month without the reappointment of the commission.  Given that the provisions of the legislation allow for the reappointment of those who have held office heretofore on the commission, does she intend to appoint any of the former members of the commission?  Has she made any contact with them to inquire if they are prepared to act on a newly appointed commission?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter for me to appoint the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  That is a matter for Government.  All I can recommend to Government is that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission be reappointed.  It is a matter for Government then to decide who the members of that commission will be.  They may well decide to reappoint some or all or none of the members who were on the commission before.  I would remind the Deputy that I am only six and a half weeks in office and I have moved as quickly as I could in that period to reconstitute the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  I think it is unfair to talk about a term of 13 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the Government have been in breach of a statutory responsibility under the 1976 Act for 13 months?  Will she condone, explain or excuse that?  Will she further confirm that in that period anyone trying to make a complaint to the commission would have found that there was only a part-time secretary and a PO Box Number available?  In circumstances where people were incensed, as so many of us were by the Dunne interview on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, what were we to do?</P>

In relation to that particular issue, or any other programming problem with RTE, if the Deputy can give me the names of people who wrote to the RTE Authority who were not happy with the response and could not make representations to the commission, by virtue of the fact that it did not exist at the time, I would be quite happy to pass on that complaint to the incoming commission when it is appointed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 21, 23, 27, 30, 32, 61 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, an expert group has been established to assess and report on the most suitable public transport options for the Harcourt Street line. The remit of this group has been extended to include examination of the possibility of developing a light rail system for Dublin.  This work will include an examination of the public transport requirements of areas such as Tallaght. The detailed work of the expert group in relation to the Harcourt Street line is now nearing completion.  In that context it has already been accepted by the Government in principle that the Harcourt Street line should be reopened as a public transport facility.</P>
      <P>However, a number of important issues in relation to the project remain to be finalised.  These include an examination of the following issues: the different public transport options; engineering and operational considerations; traffic management implications; capital aid operational costs; the position in relation to the availability of the necessary resources; the extent to which the line will be reopened, and acquisition of land which is not in public ownership.</P>

    <P>As regards the mode of public transport which will ultimately be provided on the Harcourt Street line, I believe that, in the event of sufficient resources being available on a citywide basis for Dublin, <Col N="455" /> light rail may be the desired public transport option.  However, that option would be dependent on the availability of substantial levels of financial assistance from the EC authorities.  Alternatively, and depending on the levels of funding available, bus based options could have an important role to play.</P>
    <P>I am aware that EC support has been made available to other member states for major public transport projects and it is my intention to press Ireland's case for similar treatment in the context of discussions on the next phase of the Structural Funds covering the period 1994 to 1998 and the proposed Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>However, until the full level and extent of EC support which may be available in the future for funding major public transport developments in Dublin is known, it is important that all options in relation to the development of the Harcourt Street line should be preserved. In this regard an examination is underway of the possibility of commencing preparatory work, in relation to restoration of the alignment, which would be common to both a busway option and a light rail development.  This work could include the preparation of technical and engineering specifications, detailed referencing of the land to be acquired, land surveying, preparation of tender/contract documentation, as well as investigation in relation to the possible need to relocate existing underground services.  Discussions are being held with the EC authorities in relation to possible European Regional Development Fund funding for this preparatory work under the current Operational Programme on Peripherality.</P>

      <P>In thanking the Minister for her reply may I establish the following? I understood that the Minister's predecessor had made a clear announcement that the Harcourt Street line would definitely be re-opened between Harcourt Street and Sandyford.  Would the Minister confirm that that definite decision has been made, irrespective of whether it is to be a busway or light rail system, or is there now a doubt about whether the Harcourt Street line will be reopened?</P>

      <P>There are now some grounds for believing that the former Minister misled the public.  In relation to the light rail system, there are huge problems in Dublin with regard to congestion. Earlier, the Minister indicated in her reply to Question No. 10 that this autumn she will enter into negotiations on the new operational programme.  Will she now give us a commitment that she will draw up a blueprint for a light rail system in Dublin and seek funding, in the next <i>tranche</i> of EC funding, for such a system?  Second, will she consider in relation to investment the proposals which were submitted to her predecessor by a number of private consortia with regard to a light rail system?  Finally, would she accept that it is only by making those concrete decisions that a light rail system will become a reality as opposed to a daydream?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it will only become a reality if I am successful in securing substantial EC funding for it. While I do not live in Dublin, my own personal preference would be for a light rail system on the basis that our objective must be to get people to leave their cars at home and not to cause congestion in the city.  It would be easier to encourage people to travel on a light rail system than on buses.  That is my personal opinion. During the negotiations on the next phase of Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund I will work with my European partners and in particular with the European Commissioner, Mr. Millan, to try to secure a commitment to provide as much EC funding as possible for this project.  The Deputy can rest assured that I will spare no effort in this regard.</P>

      <P>While I accept that the points made by Deputy Roche are extremely important, let me clarify the matter for the benefit of Deputy Garland.  The expert working group who are examining the costs associated with both the busway and light rail system options have received a number of proposals which vary greatly.  At this stage they only amount to estimates. These estimates are being checked for the Department at present by the international transport consultants, Steer Davies Gleave.  As Deputies are aware, <Col N="459" /> they have been engaged to assist us in formulating a citywide light rail-busway network which will be considered in the context of the Dublin transportation initiative.</P>

      <P>In respect of my question can the Minister say how many portions of land on the Harcourt Street line are currently in private ownership?  On the basis of the report, are we to assume that we have to wait for EC funding and a final report before we can acquire the necessary land?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree with me that her predecessor, Deputy Brennan, was very specific about his proposals for the Harcourt Street line?  He said that he had discovered at least £10 million in funding, that the first stage was to rebuild across the canals and roads the bridges that had heretofore been demolished, that the second stage was to provide a busway and that the infrastructure laid on would be such as to accommodate a light rail system in the future, that there was a positive and active proposal and plan which I publicly welcomed at the time he announced it? Would the Minister not further agree that it is obvious now that it was only a decision in principle, that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, in whose constituency the line runs, thought at the time that there would be a general election, <Col N="460" /> jumped the gun and committed the Government to what we are now discovering was only a policy in principle?</P>

I know that the previous Minister is committed to the reopening of the Harcourt Street line, and what I have been attempting to state here is that the decision that has been made by the Government was in fact a decision in principle.  I see nothing wrong with the Minister announcing that a decision in principle was made by the Government to open the Harcourt Street line.</P>

      <P>This dispute centres on a claim by the IBOA for a 6.5 per cent salary increase.  The claim has been the subject of intensive negotiations considered by a number of tribunals before eventually being the subject of a Labour Court hearing.  The Labour Court in its recommendation did <Col N="461" /> not find in favour of the IBOA claim for a straight salary increase and recommended an alternative approach under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which involves a 6 per cent increase from 1 May, 3 per cent basic and 3 per cent local bargaining, a lump sum of £750 and an extra day's annual leave in return for increased opening hours.  The recommendation has not been accepted by the IBOA and only the salary claim element of the recommendation is being put to a ballot with the Executive Committee of the union strongly urging members to vote against.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the Labour Court is the major industrial relations institution in this country and recommendations of the court should be given full and due consideration.  I am therefore disappointed that only the salary claim element is being voted on.</P>
      <P>The banks, for their part, have written to staff asking them to accept the terms of the Labour Court recommendation. They have also indicated that they propose to introduce longer opening hours with effect from 4 May next but this has been rejected by the IBOA.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis a resolution of this dispute rests with the banks and with the IBOA and I would now ask both sides to sit down immediately and make every effort to sort out their differences.  The continuation of the dispute cannot be in anyone's interest, least of all that of the banks themselves and their employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Court could not accept the approach of the IBOA in terms of their pay claim only, so they provided an alternative approach.  The point now is that the IBOA have decided that the alternative approach will not be addressed until members have an opportunity to vote on the Labour Court's decision on the salary claim only.  That is the part of it that they put to the ballot for the members with a recommendation to reject.  Now that there is a ballot ongoing in relation to part of the recommendation it would be inappropriate for me to say anything other than that it is important that both sides resolve this dispute.  It is in the national interest that they do so.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the Labour Court is a valued institution in our industrial relations.  It is also a valued part of our disputes settlement procedures.  The voluntary approach to the settlement of our disputes is an important facet of our industrial relations and I am asking both sides to sit down and resolve their differences. It is inappropriate for me to say any more than that on the basis that the full recommendation of the Labour Court has not been put to the members. That was for the IBOA to decide and they have decided to put just the pay claim element at this stage and that the alternative approach will not be addressed until the members have decided on pay.</P>

      <P>My concern, and I am sure the Minister's concern, is that this dispute should be brought to an end. The latest action of the banks in unilaterally issuing ultimatums to their staff is worsening the situation.  Mr. Kieran Ryan, the Chief Executive of the IBOA, has said that his statement that they were not interested in all-out strike could no longer be guaranteed at this stage.  In view of the latest development and that this big stick approach to industrial relations is simply not acceptable today, would the Minister at least undertake to <Col N="463" /> approach both sides, apart from making a public call here in this House, to see how a more reasonable approach can be adopted in relation to the dispute at issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is sufficient flexibility within the broad terms of the recommendation to allow for a settlement within the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  We must remember that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is a cornerstone of our whole economic policy. I would reiterate the voluntary nature of our industrial relations procedures and, if both sides are agreeable, the Labour Relations Commission are available to sit down and find a solution to this problem within the broad terms of the recommendations. There is sufficient flexibility to do that.  It will require both sides to discuss anything.  It is a matter for themselves. They should sit down and resolve the dispute.  It is difficult for me to say more than that because there is a ballot going on at the moment in relation to only part of the recommendation.</P>

      <P>This is a very important issue.  In the context of getting a resolution I was pleased to hear the Minister say that there is sufficient flexibility in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to have this resolved, but will the Minister not accept that the ultimatum given by the National Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland is not helpful? Will the Minister appeal to the two banks and if necessary ask the Labour Relations Commission to intervene immediately so as to resolve this dispute?  It should go from this Chamber that we want a negotiated solution and not an all out dispute which will affect the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Should both sides agree, the Labour Relations Commission is available.  Flexibility is available within the broad terms of the recommendation. The problem is that the IBOA membership do not have an opportunity in this ballot to make a decision in relation <Col N="464" /> to the alternative approach being proposed by the Labour Court.  It is somewhat unusual not to put the full recommendation, but the IBOA made that decision and the alternative approach will not be addressed until the members have had an opportunity to vote on the Labour Court decision in relation to the pay element of the claim.  I can do no more than suggest that the Labour Relations Commission is there and in any event they should sit down and resolve this dispute within the broad terms of the recommendation.  The Labour Court recommendation was the final phase of a long, protracted negotiations procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with a Bill like this matters of principle must be considered. There are two principles involved here.  One is the proper regulation of the profession so that they can perform their prime function in an orderly manner so as to allow the people in the profession to develop their skills, provide employment and render the service to the public which the public need <Col N="505" /> and deserve.  The interests of the public, of which we are the guardians, must be considered and where necessary safeguards must be applied.  In applying safeguards we must be careful not to hinder the proper working of the profession and their servicing of the public, the courts and Government offices.  It is necessary to provide a balance.</P>
      <P>In our constituency work we regularly come across legal problems and have dealings with solicitors, whom I have found by and large to be responsible in their work.  Complaints about solicitors have been made to us and they in turn have complained about Government offices such as the Land Registry and about the slow operation of the courts. They complain about the understaffing and underfinancing of many of the Government offices with which they have to deal and about other issues.  There has been unjustified criticism of solicitors in this House.  I am aware that there was a Judas among the 12 apostles and that there are such among solicitors.  No organisation is free from such people or free from criticism.  The responsible members of the solicitors profession are aware of the problems and their response to the Bill has been conveyed to me in this light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the Law Society, which is the governing body of the profession. It has been brought to my attention that the Law Society is Dublin based and Dublin orientated and operates largely on Dublin principles.  There appears to be two professions &mdash; one which operates in Dublin, involving one-third of the profession, with the remaining two-thirds operating outside of Dublin in much more difficult circumstances.  The country solicitors I represent are, like the rest of society in the western half of the country, operating in very difficult circumstances. Their clients are emigrating or are unemployed in many cases.  There is little economic activity across the Shannon in the west of Ireland at this stage. They try to maintain their staff and their <Col N="506" /> services.  They are considerable employers.  In Listowel they employ between 40 and 50 people.  This is a very important contribution in a town where over 1,800 people are drawing the dole and there is general despair about the future, particularly among the farming community.  We must therefore be careful not to crucify solicitors because a number of them are giving the profession as a whole a bad name.</P>
    <P>In passing comment on the Law Society, I appreciate that they have a difficult job to do.  I am somewhat concerned that they are enlarging their numbers by way of a large number of honorary members.  This may create an &ldquo;old boys club&rdquo; attitude in Dublin.  Country solicitors are worried about this because they have not the time or the opportunity to serve in the Law Society with any regularity.  They are often involved in district courts and cannot attend meetings in Dublin to answer for and guide the profession.  For that reason they often see the Law Society as a body who summon them to Dublin to answer complaints from clients, or in some cases from cranks, and they then cannot vindicate the solicitor in question if it is found that the complaints are not genuine.  Country solicitors tell me that the Law Society are disliked and feared by many of them.  They are regarded as a great time waster and not a body who do a great deal for the profession.  They seem to be far more interested in accusing solicitors on behalf of the public than in defending them in the proper circumstances.</P>
    <P>Many solicitors feel that the widened powers of discipline and the nature of these powers provided for in this Bill will substantially interfere with their practice, their right to work and the manner in which they carry on their business with the public.  If any member of the public or any person with an interest is to be able to make a complaint to the Law Society, no matter how trivial, that a solicitor has been in some way inadequate <Col N="507" /> in handling a case or cases, a major investigation is to be launched. Who is to pay for this?  It will cost the solicitor and the Law Society a great deal of time, money, anxiety and stress.  Solicitors often work for emotionally upset people in bitter disputes with other people, sometimes members of their own family.  If they lose the dispute they often turn on the nearest target, namely the solicitor.  This is particularly the case in family and matrimonial disputes where solicitors, as officers of the court, have responsibilities which clients sometimes see as conflicting with their own interests and the allegations being made by the client.  Thus a solicitor might feel he has an obligation to the children of a marriage not to make certain allegations.  If the client subsequently blames the solicitor for that, what is the solicitor to do? He may face months of inquisition by the Law Society.</P>
    <P>I have consulted widely with the legal profession in north Kerry regarding the provisions of this Bill.  I wish to convey to the House their attitude and mine to the various proposals.  Their welcome of the Bill is by no means as wholehearted as that of the Law Society.  They have made special comment on certain sections.  They regard sections 8 to 14, inclusive, as much too wide.  These policing powers will be enormously expensive to monitor and will create an ever-increasing bureaucracy in the Law Society.  The annual charge for membership and related costs have grown to be a burden on members and will result in increased charges on the public.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 8, they believe that the term &ldquo;any person having an interest&rdquo; is too wide and should only relate to a person with a contractual interest.  They believed there should also be a time limit in accordance with the normal Statute of Limitations in relation to complaints and claims of this nature. They suggest a one to three year time limit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> With regard to the appointment of an independent adjudicator pursuant to section 15, that is the Ombudsman, to deal with complaints about the society's handling of complaints against solicitors, they feel that the solicitors and the legal profession should not be obliged to fund this.</P>
    <P>On section 16 and the appointment of lay persons to the disciplinary committee of the Law Society, they are in favour of this, although consideration should be given to the establishment of an independent body or tribunal to deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>Section 17 grants power to the disciplinary committee to impose limited sanctions directly on solicitors.  They feel that this provision may well be unconstitutional. The Minister might clarify this when replying.  Should such provisions be enacted, any such disciplinary committee, in order to be in a position to vindicate if necessary the position of the solicitor investigated on foot of a complaint and found not guilty of misconduct, should be in a position to award costs against an unsuccessful complainant. I may not entirely agree with them in that objection to section 17, but people are free to make ridiculous accusations against solicitors.  Unless there is some penalty this tendency will become more common.  Solicitors also feel that a fee should be payable on the lodgment by any complaint of a complaint against a solicitor, such a fee to be refundable if the complaint is subsequently held to be valid.  That is a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>Regarding sections 26, 30 and 31 relating to the powers of the society to intervene in the practices of solicitors in certain circumstances, they are of the opinion that restrictions are not levied on doctors, accountants, financial advisers and certain other professionals.  They feel that the precise powers of the society should be clearly indicated.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 62 of the Bill relating to the prohibition on the charging of costs by way of percentage or the deduction <Col N="509" /> of costs without prior agreement, solicitors feel that a prohibition on a percentage charge is totally unreasonable and unacceptable.  In their experience many clients prefer and regularly request a solicitor to deal with a matter on a percentage basis.  Other professions charge on that basis.  Some clients might be afraid to bring forward a case on other than a percentage basis.  Solicitors feel that the correct procedure is for a solicitor to enter into an agreement with his client regarding fees and costs prior to acting in the matter, but the agreement should be left as a matter of contract between the solicitor and his client.  I feel that the proposed prohibition on percentage charges should be removed from this legislation.  If a percentage were to be agreed between the solicitor and the client, the matter should be left as one of contract between the parties and the Law Society should not interfere with any such arrangement.  All such arrangements should be in writing.  I have had personal experience of people who have had problems in this regard.  If this provision is removed, a number of people will not go ahead with cases where there is a doubt.</P>
    <P>A number of solicitors have expressed concern about the possible time limit on claims by clients against solicitors on the question of costs or otherwise.  They express the view that a three-year limit should be sought on such claims, notwithstanding the Statute of Limitations.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 63 and the proposed prohibition on the society preventing solicitors from advertising fees, they feel, and I agree, that solicitors should be allowed to advertise generally.  This is a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 72, many solicitors strongly oppose the granting of power to non-practising barristers and solicitors to provide conveyancing services to employers.  They do not contribute to the compensation fund and, therefore, the granting of these powers seems to be unconstitutional and inequitable. <Col N="510" /> I would like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
    <P>With regard to sections 73 and 74, most solicitors are opposed to these provisions which allow banks to provide conveyancing and probate services.  The following points are relevant in this regard, and this is my view on the matter.  There would be a lack of independent representation when dealing with the bank. The client may find himself dealing with untrained bank clerk staff rather than properly qualified and trained legal experts.  The prohibition on cross-selling envisaged by section 74 is unworkable and unenforceable and represents a threat to the public in matters of conflict of interests.  It should be made clear to the public that a move in this direction would lead to monopolies being imposed by the banks in regard to mortgage insurance and so on, which would be undesirable.  For example, as well as dealing with loan transactions the bank could deal with conveyancing and insurance of the property, thereby allowing for no involvement by anybody else and no competition between various institutions. Therefore, there are dangers in this provision.</P>
    <P>With regard to probate the banks are not in a position to give proper legal advice because they do not have the necessary expertise.  For example, solicitors are not available in banks if one goes to a solicitor one gets the proper legal advice at all times.  In addition, the banks are not subject to Law Society type regulations, to the protection afforded by the compensation fund or to the compulsory professional indemnity insurance which all solicitors will have under the new Bill.  Legal costs will be hidden in other charges and interests rates.  Bank charges for executors and trustees are much higher than solicitors' fees.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation has many points of merit and I welcome it.  It is time that practices were properly regulated and that these people were made more accountable.  There are many provisions <Col N="511" /> in the Bill that need clarification and amendment.  The points I have mentioned are very important matters which require immediate discussion and action and I hope they will be conveyed to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <P>It has been said that sad cases make bad law.  The case I will outline in tedious detail, for which I apologise to the House, is a very sad case.  It indicates how extraordinarily sensitive is the relationship between a solicitor and a client and how a solicitor can abuse a client.  In this case no fewer than six solicitors abuse a single lady who took early retirement, resulting in her now living in conditions of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case illustrates the injustice that can be inflicted on a citizen by a so-called liberal profession.  I do not pretend that this case is typical of the generality of relationships between clients and their solicitors.  I hope it is not so typical, but it is not unusual to hear of cases of this nature.  The case also illustrates the extent to which matters can go wrong under the existing arrangements.  It illustrates the extraordinary vulnerability of the citizen in dealing with any professional service and the urgent need for reform, particularly the type of reforms introduced by the Bill.  I suggest that in some cases the Bill does not go far enough.  It is only a first step, although a good one.  This case suggests that we should go further and introduce <i>ab initio</i> an independent legal services ombudsman who would be available to the citizens at all times.  The case I have in mind involves a constituent, whom I will call Betty.  Solicitors and solicitors' firms, all of whom emerge with ignominy with the Incorporated Law Society, who sat on their well-manicured hands for over seven years, doing nothing to relieve the <Col N="512" /> distress and the plight of this constituent of mine.</P>
    <P>In May 1983 Betty viewed a three bedroom prefabricated chalet of approximately 700 sq.ft. on one-sixth of an acre of land in County Wicklow.  The property was for sale privately.  The usual undertakings were given with the sale document &mdash; there was full planning permission, the septic tank was in an adjoining field and everything was supposed to be in order.  In June 1983 Betty engaged a solicitor, whom I will call Mr. NS, to act for her in the proposed purchase. During the consultations it was specifically agreed that a careful check of the planning permission would be made. Betty gave specific instructions in writing to ascertain the exact location of the septic tank and the existence of rights of way.  In July 1982, on receiving her solicitor's assurance that everything was in order, Betty signed the contract of sale.  She paid the agreed sum in cash and a few months later she paid to her solicitor £1,555 in legal fees, stamp duty and Land Registry fees.  In November 1983 my constituent signed a deed of transfer, but no map was appended.  This was the first occasion on which she began to feel that something might be wrong.</P>
    <P>During the first 18 months or so of occupancy of the house Betty invested the balance of a cash payment which she received on retiring from a State-sponsored body.  She intended to make this house her retirement home for the rest of her life, somewhere that would be comfortable and a pleasure in which to live.  A year later the problems began to emerge one after another.  In December 1984 my constituent had difficulty in contacting her solicitor regarding outstanding matters, particularly the transfer of title.  At that stage the solicitor had gone out of public practice, although from time to time he gave advice on a well known RTE programme.  Betty had not been notified that the solicitor had gone out of practice or that the practice had been taken over by another well <Col N="513" /> known and well respected firm of solicitors in this city.  That firm refused to handle the unfinished business unless Betty agreed to pay further fees.</P>
    <P>In March 1985 my constituent contacted the Incorporated Law Society and asked who was responsible for concluding the conveyancing in this regard. She also asked the reasonable question why the second firm should request her to pay a second tranche of fees.  Betty contacted the Land Registry and found to her surprise that two applications for transfer of title had been made during the year 1984, both of which had been rejected.  Neither the original solicitors' firm nor the firm which took over that business informed my constituent of these rejections even though they were aware of them.  When Betty visited the planning department of the county council she was told that there was no planning permission and no planning file for the structure &mdash; so much for the capacity of a solicitor to handle a simple matter such as conveyancing &mdash; and that she should make an application for retention.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the condition of the house was deteriorating.  It developed several serious structural faults, which indicated that a second professional adviser, the architect-engineer, had also been deficient in the performance of his duties. In August 1985 Betty informed the Law Society of what she had discovered and consulted another solicitor.  With great difficulty and considerable delay, the file was passed to that solicitor by the company which had taken over the business of the original solicitor.  When the file was examined in the second solicitor's office an extraordinary series of details came to light.</P>
    <P>First, the second application to the Land Registry had been rejected because the Deed of Transfer had been altered after being signed by both parties &mdash; a fraudulent alteration; second, the property described in the deed and marked on the relevant map was not in fact the property that Betty had bought.  Not only <Col N="514" /> was it not the property she had bought but it was not even in the right townland. The site described was one and a half miles from the site Betty had bought.  So much for the capacity of a solicitor's firm &mdash; and I am talking about a well-known solicitor &mdash; to operate appropriately; third, the location of the septic tank had not been ascertained, nor had any access rights been sought or obtained from the owner of nearby land; fourth, a retention order was granted on appeal in 1975, on compassionate grounds, by the local county council; fifth, the actual planning document had not been received in Betty's original solicitor's office until nine days after she had signed the contract, on the advice of her original solicitor.</P>
    <P>Sixth, it emerged that the solicitor's office had never contacted the planning department and had never made a search of the plan of the Planning Register &mdash; although he had charged £1,555 <i>inter alia</i> for that service; and seventh, a considerable amount of inaccurate information had been given in the requisitions, particularly in regard to planning and in regard to the septic tank.</P>
    <P>The second solicitor engaged by Betty was horrified at what he found and advised her that the only person she could hold liable in this matter was her original solicitor.  In this extraordinarily tragic mess, the second solicitor was the one person who dealt with my constituent decently and compassionately.  He told her, quite frankly, that there was little point in a person with little means seeking to sue a solicitor.  He said that he would terminate his case rather than take money from her.  As it turns out, that advice was the most honest and decent that my unfortunate constituent received from any of the six separate sets of solicitors with whom she dealt.</P>
    <P>In September 1985 Betty again visited the planning department of the local county council, this time with a folio reference number.  The Planning Register showed further anomalies.  First, an application for retention had been made <Col N="515" /> in 1974 &mdash; Betty's original solicitor had never ascertained that fact.  The application had been refused on the grounds that the house was in a designated area and was not in character with other buildings in the district, and there were material contraventions right, left and centre of the county development plan. Second, the planning file showed that the retention order granted on the appeal in 1975 had never been properly entered in the Planning Register &mdash; that was a mistake at local authority level.</P>
    <P>The planning file could not be produced by either the county council or An Bord Pleanála.  Wicklow County Council subsequently confirmed that the issue of a fresh planning permission could not be recommended because it very seriously contravened all of the county's planning rules.</P>
    <P>Betty then sought help by contacting various organisations in the area.  Various professional contacts were made; builders and local political representatives were contacted.  In all, 30 people were written to by this unfortunate woman, who, at this stage, saw her life savings disappearing before her very eyes.</P>
    <P>It was at that stage that I first came across Betty, who was extraordinarily distressed.  She had had to vacate her house because of severe structural problems; she was, to say the least, being biffed by her various solicitors; and she was living in board and lodgings in a guesthouse.</P>
    <P>In January 1986 Betty, as a last resort, decided to consult another solicitor.  In fact, she had difficulties in getting another solicitor to handle her case.  The solicitor she engaged was a young lady solicitor who had recently started practice. At the outset Betty made it clear to her new solicitor that she was reluctant to resort to court action if the matter could be resolved by any other means. Frankly, she feared that she would not get justice against a solicitor.  The new solicitor said that she would first endeavour <Col N="516" /> to have title sorted out and would not charge fees until she knew whether or not the fees could be recouped from the original solicitor.</P>
    <P>In February 1986 the new solicitor made an application for registration of caution to the Land Registry.  The application was rejected on the grounds that the map lodged was not an original ordnance survey map to the largest possible scale.  That was another example of rank incompetence on the part of yet another solicitor, because it is clear from the documents that an original ordnance survey map to the largest possible scale has to be produced.</P>
    <P>In June 1986 the new solicitor advised that time was running out and strongly urged Betty to lodge proceedings as a precaution against being barred by the Statute of Limitations.  Very reluctantly and with some trepidation, Betty agreed to do that, and counsel was engaged.</P>
    <P>In May 1987 draft proceedings for a Circuit Court case were furnished to Betty.  Her solicitor advised that the next step would be a consultation with the counsel.  It took an incredible 21 months for that counsel to proffer his time to the solicitor and to the solicitor's client; a full 21 months elapsed before a meeting could be organised &mdash; and this, I remind the House, was in the days before the Beef Tribunal when those guys were not mining a vale of pure gold in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I was continuing my efforts at local level and had succeeded in having the planning file finally produced. The original application for planning permission was missing from the file, but the file contained documents going back to 1970 and a map that showed the original site area to be 2.2 acres, not the considerably lesser amount of land that Betty had bought.  The permission on appeal had apparently been granted on purely compassionate grounds, although several requirements of good and proper planning had not been fulfilled.  The council <Col N="517" /> had granted the original retention for compassionate reasons.</P>
    <P>In May 1987 I took the matter up with the Incorporated Law Society.  After protracted correspondence between myself, Betty and the Law Society, I had a meeting with an assistant secretary of the society.  With reluctance, the society allowed my constituent to sit in on that meeting.</P>
    <P>In September 1988, as a result of the meeting some 15 months earlier, Mr. N.S., the original and by this time retired solicitor, was brought before the Registrar's Committee of the Law Society. This was five full years after the sorry series of events had started.  At this stage my constituent was worn out and practically at the point of despair.  One would have thought that the Law Society, having wielded its magisterial presence &mdash; reluctantly &mdash; into the case would provide Betty with some solace.  But, no, the committee's opinion was that &ldquo;there were matters of law involved&rdquo; and that Betty should &ldquo;seek and be guided by the advice of her solicitor&rdquo;.  If this case were not so tragic it would by that stage have been a farce.  My constituent had been dealing with four different solicitors by that time.  Betty's new solicitor was kept informed throughout these developments.</P>
    <P>In January 1989 a meeting with counsel and Betty's solicitor took place.  When the full facts of the case were discussed Betty was recommended to change from the Circuit Court to a High Court action, to which she agreed.  In March 1989 a plenary summons was issued, finally, on the original solicitor.  In October 1989 Betty attended a further meeting with her counsel and solicitor to discuss the claim.  At or about the beginning of the following year a firm of solicitors were at last appointed to represent the interests of Betty's original solicitor.  On 20 July 1990 Betty's solicitor gave the original solicitor a deadline of 21 days for the filing of the defence.  After five years, such a deadline was generous.  The date <Col N="518" /> was not met.  A senior member of the firm made an issue of the fact that he had not yet received the full file.  I know that solicitor's offices are somewhat like those of TDs, not terribly well organised but, after all that time, one would have imagined that that gentleman would have read through the papers on his desk and found Betty's file.</P>
    <P>Betty's new solicitor, at this stage mark 4, confirmed that she was furnishing copies of the completed file.  He also served a notice for particulars which was duly dealt with.  In October 1990, seven years after the deed of transfer had been signed, the defending solicitor advised that the defendor was prepared to grant way-leave to the septic tank &mdash; seven years after the original solicitor had said there were no problems with the septic tank; and all was in order.  Of course, that was an admission that his client had been seriously negligent in just one of the many particulars to which, in a simple conveyancing, attention should be given.</P>
    <P>On 22 January 1991 Betty's solicitor again gave 21 days deadline for the filing of the defence, which deadline was not met.  On 7 February 1991 another 21 days deadline was given; that was not met. Betty's solicitor's explanation at that stage for allowing so much grace was that the defence might come up with some obscure legal point for which she, the new solicitor, was not prepared.</P>
    <P>In April 1991 Betty instructed her solicitor not to wait any longer, to go ahead with a motion for judgment in default of defence, a simple course of action which should not have required a constituent of mine &mdash; who at that stage had become somewhat of an expert in law &mdash; to advise her solicitor; one would have thought the solicitor would have done that of her own volition.  This was listed for hearing on 15 April 1991 but, on that morning, Betty received a telephone call from her solicitor saying it had been agreed by both sides to give yet a further 21 days grace. My constituent, seven and a half years after suffering her original injury, did not <Col N="519" /> agree to a further extension and gave specific instructions that there should be no further extension, requested that the motion for judgment be brought before the court in default.  Her specific, written instructions, repeated time and again, were ignored by her latest solicitor.  The defence was not furnished within the new deadline either.</P>
    <P>Betty continued to put pressure on her solicitor, both by telephone and letter, referring to the inordinate delays, and instructing her to seek the earliest possible date for a hearing.  On 8 May 1991 Betty received the draft of an agreement for way-leave to the septic tank for comment. Her comments were choice, if unprintable.  Counsel advised that it should be accepted without prejudice. Betty agreed but pointed out that the agreement described her as the registered owner which, of course, she was not, because registration had never taken place.</P>
    <P>On 19 July 1991 Betty's solicitor gave seven days notice, and a stern letter, for the filing of the defence.  On 1 August 1991 Betty received a copy of the defence from her solicitor dated 6 May 1991.  The defence was a simple and blatant denial of every single item.  Subsequently Betty's solicitor told her she proposed to arrange a meeting with the defendant's solicitors and with the vendor's solicitors in the hope of negotiating a mutually agreeable out of court settlement.</P>
    <P>Betty wrote to her solicitor again on 7 August 1991.  She wrote again in September and, on 26 September 1991, she contacted her solicitor to ask whether the proposed meeting had taken place, what had happened and if she, the solicitor, was not too busy would she let her, her mere client, know what was going on in the case.  She also sought from her solicitor an assurance that the inordinate delays would not be detrimental to her case and again instructed her to go ahead and seek a date for a hearing if there <Col N="520" /> were no immediate positive results from the negotiations.</P>
    <P>On 14 October 1991 Betty's solicitor telephoned and referred to the delay being caused by the industrial dispute at the courts.  She suggested it might expedite the matter by a few months if Betty, my constituent, agreed to change her case back to the Circuit Court.  It should be remembered that this is the same solicitor who had advised her three years earlier to go to the High Court because of the higher level of claim that can be negotiated there.  It is also interesting to note how the solicitor, who had allowed so many delays could so blatantly blame an industrial relations issue which had just then emerged and use it to excuse their inactivity and that of the generations of solicitors with whom my constituent had been dealing.</P>
    <P>On 18 October 1991 Betty wrote to her solicitor again stating that she did not agree with this course of action which would be clearly a retrograde step, putting a limitation on the amount of claim that could be pursued.  Betty repeated her instructions to her solicitor to seek the earliest possible date for a High Court hearing and requested her to confirm that she was proceeding, as instructed, but that, to date, she had not replied to that letter.  Betty continued to press her solicitor through the last few months of 1991, finally writing requesting a reply to her queries.</P>
    <P>Without going through the list of the more recent correspondence, the case remains unresolved to this very day.  My constituent, in the early eighties, took early retirement from a State-sponsored body and invested all her cash in a nice little house which was to be a happy place in which to spend the remainder of her days.  In these later years of her life, which should be a period of joy she now lives in one room, effectively reduced to living in bed and breakfast accommodation by a crowd of thugs who should not be allowed to be a member of any profession.  It is a scandal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> The reason I have relayed this scandal in such detail is because I am sure it is not the only such scandal.  Perhaps if some elements of this case were brought to the attention of the public, a cord of decency in somebody's body would be struck and well-heeled solicitors will do something to alleviate the extraordinary plight of this unfortunate constituent of mine.  To my mind it illustrates the failure not merely of solicitors to operate within grounds of common decency but also illustrates the extraordinary failure of the Incorporated Law Society to vindicate the rights of a citizen.  Under our laws that society has been given a privileged position.  They are supposed to oversee a liberal profession.  But for seven years they did not do anything in this case.  In all of my contacts with the Incorporated Law Society, it is only fair to say, they were very correct.  However, no one could ever shake off the feeling my constituent and I had that, above all, the focus of that society was to protect the members of that profession.  Above all, this sad case illustrates to me &mdash; as it has illustrated to other Members &mdash; the vital need for a proper set of procedures to deal expeditiously with complaints from the legal profession.</P>
    <P>The central core of this Bill deals with the manner in which complaints regarding solicitors are handled.  As the former Minister, Deputy Burke, said when introducing the Bill, there has been persistent public criticism of the way in which complaints about solicitors are dealt with by the Incorporated Law Society.  If the case I have just outlined is anything to go on, it is not unreasonable to claim that there have been persistent complaints about the way citizens are dealt with by that society.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome in that it represents a major reform and upgrades the law in relation to solicitors.  It is also welcome because its provisions will allow the profession to respond to change and its publication affords this House an <Col N="522" /> opportunity to consider how a vital profession operates.</P>
    <P>Part III will help to provide a new procedure for the investigation of complaints, welcomed by previous speakers also.  These provisions are long overdue. While they will not prevent a recurrence of cases such as that of my constituent, they will mean that in the future people who feel aggrieved at the action or, more precisely, the inaction of their solicitors will have a more clear-cut means of appeal open to them.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the changes being introduced which will go some way to alleviating the most glaring problems, I feel a sense of unease that, in the first instance, complaints will still be referred to the Incorporated Law Society.  They should be divorced from the issue of complaints. The public, rightly or wrongly, perceive the Incorporated Law Society as being primarily involved in the protection of the interests of solicitors.  While in my limited dealings with the Incorporated Law Society I was always dealt with correctly and properly, the public have some reason for their feeling.</P>
    <P>Section 15 allows for independent adjudication of complaints concerning the manner in which the Incorporated Law Society handle a complaint brought to their attention whereas it would be infinitely better were the complaints rolled into one independent institution.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be better for a full legal services ombudsman to be appointed on the nomination of the Miniter for Justice, with the agreement of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A legal services Ombudsman should be allowed to examine all complaints, save perhaps complaints regarding the level of fees. He should be entitled to hand down an adjudication which should be implemented by the Law Society.  The existing endorsement powers of the Law Society, including the power to strike a solicitor off the register, could then be brought into play in order to ensure relief <Col N="523" /> for clients whose complaint has been upheld.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the situation in the legal profession is exactly analogous to the situation which existed in public administration before this House created the office of Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act, 1980.  At that time the State could have taken the decision to extend the in-house appellate systems which already existed.  This procedure was recommended in the 1969 Devlin report.  However, this House took a more radical view of the situation at that time. Perhaps it should consider taking a more radical view of the situation at that time. Minister to consider taking a more radical view now.  As I said, the course of action proposed in the 1969 Devlin report was not acted upon.  Instead the Houses of the Oireachtas imported an institution and grafted it on to our administrative system.  In spite of the prophets of doom, the graft took and the new institution, the Ombudsman, blossomed.  There does not seem to be any good reason why the same institution could not be established <i>ab initio</i> in this case.  I accept that the step being taken by the Minister in the Bill is a move in that direction.  As in the area of public administration, a legal services ombudsman would provide citizens with a quick, relatively cheap and visibly independent alternative and supplement to the existing or proposed complaints system.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provisions in other sections of the Bill.  Section 21 provides for the publication of annual information about complaints.  The section does not make clear the amount of information which should be published.  Will this information simply be an anonymous digest of statistics?  If so, I believe it will be useless in forewarning the public about rogue operators.  It seems that too much discretion is being left to the Law Society and their committees in regard to the application of section 21.  I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of <Col N="524" /> ensuring, either by way of amendment or ministerial order after the Bill is enacted, that the exact type of information which should be made available is set out clearly.  If there are rogues operating in the solicitors' profession &mdash; I accept that these are only a small minority &mdash; then their names, the names of their businesses and the names of the firms under which they operate should be published in the same way as the names of people who try to avoid paying tax in this State are published.  Rogues should be faced with the full opprobrium of having their names made public.</P>
    <P>Section 22 (1) will leave too much discretion to the Law Society.  As things stand, the society could decide to effectively suppress publicity about a case even when their disciplinary committee have made an order.  This does not seem to be correct.  When we set down rules here we should make it clear that we not only want them to be applied but we want it to be made clear to the public that they are being applied.  In spite of these caveats, I welcome the provisions in this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I generally welcome the provisions in Part IV of the Bill which deals with the protection of clients.  However, I wonder if the maximum fine proposed under section 26 (2), £500, is sufficient.  Given that the passage of time inevitably reduces the value of money, I wonder if it is wise to specify in law an amount without index linking it.  This observation applies to a host of other sections where reference is made to fines.  I have no doubt that other Members will make the same point.</P>
    <P>I understand and welcome in a general way the provisions in Part V.  However, I have developed a jaundiced view of the so-called liberal professions and their capacity to self-regulate their activities. In particular, I have doubts about the wisdom of any profession controlling both education and admission into their profession.  This can give rise to complaints. In the case of the solicitors' profession <Col N="525" /> it has given rise to charges that the profession are restrictive, elitist and self-serving.  I do not know, nor can I judge, the accuracy of the charges which have been made but they suggest that perhaps we should give more fundamental consideration to the issue of education in this area.  In fact, I would go a step further.  Both the State and this House should look at the relationship between professional bodies, education and educational standards.  I am not sure what the answer to this conundrum is but it strikes me that there is a problem here. If a profession control education and admission to their profession, they are, at a very minimum, always open to the charge that they are abusing their power to serve the self-interests of their members, limiting the number of people being admitted or operating some form of old boys network.  I believe many things about the Law Society but I do not believe those charges, if made, would be true.  Nevertheless, we need to think about education, professional training and admission, not just to this profession but to all liberal professions right across the board.</P>
    <P>There has been a body of complaint in regard to the education of solicitors, which is dealt with in section 43 of the Bill and section 40 of the principal Act. The complaints made should be examined and thought given to having a more direct State input to protect the public interest and ensure fair play, especially for young people with no legal background who may wish to enter the profession. From my contacts with my students over the years and young people in my constituency &mdash; I am sure other Members have had the same experience &mdash; I know there is a feeling that these professions are a closed shop.  It is believed that a person who is on a certain inside track will be able to get into the profession.  I do not necessarily believe that that is true, but we should put in place some institutional arrangements which will indicate to young people that <Col N="526" /> if they wish to get into this profession or any other profession they can do so on the basis of their capacity, merits and ability and not on the basis of linkages, nepotism or friendships.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister and his predecessor on bringing it forward.  It will be no secret to Members of this House that I harbour the most profound doubts about allowing the legal profession or any other profession to examine complaints about themselves.  I do not think you can be a judge in your own case.  The establishment of an independent system of adjudicating on complaints on how the Law Society investigate complaints against them is provided for in the Bill. This is a good first step in the right direction. However, I would urge the Minister and his Department to think of going a step further and upgrade the proposal by appointing a full legal services ombudsman who will have the capacity <i>ab initio</i> to examine all complaints and ensure that complainants receive justice.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the extraordinary case of a woman who over a seven year period has literally been reduced to a piteous state.  I do not believe this is in any way indicative of what happens in the vast majority of cases, but the fact of the matter is that this tragedy has occurred. The Law Society have been aware of the case for four years.  They have given this woman courteous hearings but, to their grave discredit, they have not given her justice.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is good legislation but equally I have no doubt that we need to think a little further about the issue.</P>
    <P>I complimented the Minister in his absence on bringing this Bill forward and I now compliment him in his presence on doing so. However, I hope the Minister will give consideration at this stage to providing also that the legal services ombudsman &mdash; ombudsperson perhaps &mdash; could deal with all complaints <i>ab initio</i><Col N="527" /> and not wait until the law society have had their day and then come back.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Policing O'Connell Street, Dublin.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this issue in the House.  I regret that I have reason to do so but O'Connell Street, as the premier street in our capital city, was once very attractive and renowned throughout the world.  It was a well-known tourist area and people strolled and window-shopped in it.  It was an area for courting couples and families, particularly in the evenings and at weekends.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, this position has changed drastically in recent years and O'Connell Street has now become a no-go area, particularly after 8 p.m.  People are now afraid to walk down this street, groups congregate and intimidate ordinary people, which is totally unacceptable.  It is up to the Garda authorities to ensure that people can walk on our streets in safety.</P>
      <P>On St. Patrick's Day the situation got completely out of hand.  The Garda are aware of this and I hope it will never happen again.  Undesirable elements loitering in the vicinity of the fountain are causing grave concern; I have been informed that recently a youth in broad daylight stood on the statue, took off his clothes and urinated into the fountain in front of the general public.  Where were the Garda?  Tourists having a meal in a nearby restaurant were heard to ask what is becoming of Dublin.  I am also aware that on other occasions tourists were intimidated crossing the street, they were chased into a restaurant and the Garda had to be called to escort them from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of planning, O'Connell Street is a disaster area.  I say that as a public representative.  While I accept the need for some fast food outlets, it is totally unacceptable that our main city street has 20 fast food outlets <Col N="528" /> and a number of casinos, some of which are attracting undesirable elements to the area.  The congregation of these groups and intimidation is obviously affecting trade in the area.  I am aware that at present 30 employees in one area are on protective notice because of the drop in trade as a direct consequence of these activities.</P>
    <P>I watched the Minister on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; last Friday night and he was made well aware of the great concern and anger of people present.  In the short term, extra resources by way of manpower and equipment will have to be provided and there will also have to be a visible presence.  However, this cannot be at the expense of other areas in the city, which seems to be the solution at present.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the needs of many of the young people congregating in O'Connell Street are met.  Recreational facilities will have to be provided in some of the urban communities around Dublin so that young people have an alternative to loitering on street corners in the city centre.  This is a major issue and I hope the Minister can give a commitment to provide resources and facilities for young people so that the problem will be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan raised the question of policing O'Connell Street, the main street and thoroughfare of our capital city.  This matter had already been raised publicly with me in the course of my recent appearance on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and I might be forgiven for thinking that Deputy Ryan got his inspiration to raise the issue on the Adjournment from comments on that show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not need the Minister's appearance on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; to inspire me to make such comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the specific problem raised with me about O'Connell Street on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; is not a problem peculiar to <Col N="529" /> O'Connell Street alone but is one which can arise in any place which is frequented by a large number of people late at night. Essentially, the problem is one of fear and trepidation caused to passers-by because of the conduct of young people who congregate in large groups at street corners or elsewhere and usually after pub closing times.  The young people concerned are usually boisterous and inebriated. They are wont to consume drink on the street even though they are under age to buy.  I gave a very clear undertaking on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; to do something about this problem and I want to repeat that undertaking now in this House.  I am intent on ensuring that law abiding citizens of every age and condition can walk the streets of our cities and towns without fear and without being taunted or verbally abused.</P>
      <P>Since my appearance on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, I have obtained a report from the Garda authorities about the incidence of acts of intimidation in O'Connell Street.  They have informed me that people on the street late at night can be apprehensive when they meet groups of young people.  In such situations people can feel intimidated even though they may be at no risk whatsoever and in many cases there is no question of any criminal or abusive behaviour on the part of the young people concerned. However, situations do arise in which there is a very real threat to people on the street and this behaviour is not acceptable.  The Garda authorities inform me that gardaí on duty in the O'Connell Street area regularly intervene in such situations and that charges can be and are brought against persons who engage in this behaviour while drunk and disorderly or who constitute a breach of the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear to this House, however, that although more law is required in this area, the Garda are far from operating in a total legal vacuum in this respect.  First, the drink laws were updated and substantially strengthened <Col N="530" /> in 1988 to deal with the problem of underage drinking.  We now have very wide-ranging and comprehensive provisions in this regard on our Statute Book.  The law is there and it will be vigorously enforced.</P>
    <P>The second aspect relates to the existing law on public order.  The Garda have certain powers already, including the power of arrest for breaches of the peace, which can be used in these cases. However, I accept that there may be an argument for additional provisions.  That is why my Department are currently in the process of preparing draft legislation to modernise the law in certain relevant respects as recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  These new provisions will apply to adults as well as to persons under 18.  They include the creation of offences relating to: (a) persons being found drunk (or under the influence of drugs) in such circumstances that they are a danger to themselves or others; (b) the use of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place; and (c) disorderly conduct as, for instance, shouting, singing or boisterous conduct between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. in circumstances which cause annoyance to other persons in the neighbourhood. These new offences will carry the power of arrest and liability to substantial fines and, if drink is involved, I intend that the Garda will have the power to confiscate it on the spot.  In spite of the already full agenda of law reform which is being addressed in my Department I can tell the House that it is my intention to bring forward the necessary legislation to deal with street intimidation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the level of Garda resources deployed in the O'Connell Street area.  In all there are five Garda stations in close proximity to O'Connell Street, including a station on O'Connell Street itself, at 44 Upper O'Connell Street.  There are over 630 gardaí assigned to these five stations which gives the O'Connell Street area one of the highest concentrations of Garda manpower <Col N="531" /> in the country.  Of course, there are special policing considerations which have to be considered in relation to the O'Connell Street area.  During the day the area caters for a multitude of shoppers and houses very many retail, financial and other business interests.  At night the area is frequented by large numbers of people who attend social and cultural events.  There are many opportunities for street criminals to ply their trade in the area and the Garda Síochána are fully aware that a constant Garda presence is required in the area to provide the level of policing necessary to safeguard the public and to prevent crime.</P>
    <P>Garda patrols, both uniform and plainclothes, are operated round the clock on O'Connell Street.  Arrangements were made recently to augment the level of patrolling and covert surveillance activity by the Garda in the area during the late night and early morning period.  This has afforded additional protection to those citizens who are in the area at this time.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by informing the House that the need for further additional manpower to be deployed in the O'Connell Street area will be addressed when the next group of trainee gardaí graduate from the Garda college in June.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Prison Suicide.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I also thank the Minister for Justice for coming into the House to listen to what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragic life of Derek Ward who committed suicide on St. Patrick's Day and the horrific circumstances leading to his imprisonment in St. Patrick's Institution should have alerted all concerned to his mental instability.  He was accused &mdash; and it is generally established as accepted fact &mdash; of being involved in <Col N="532" /> the brutal multiple stabbing to death of his mother.  His father, whom he had never met outside prison, has been serving a term of life imprisonment in the United Kingdom, Derek, along with all his brothers and sisters, was raised in cruel institutions, orphanages, in the United Kingdom.  The cruelty meted out to him is illustrated in a letter that I received from his father in January of this year a short time before young Derek took his life.  I have included this letter with my statement and I hope that on making it available to the Minister and to the House it will be included in full in the Official Report, as I will not have time to read it in full.</P>
    <P>His two older brothers had spent terms in prison recently on the Isle of Wight. His cousin, his children and her children perished in a fire in Clondalkin and his uncle is serving life imprisonment for this horrendous act.  In addition, an aunt and another cousin died around the same time in a separate fire.  All these facts were known to the authorities when Derek was arrested.  If ever a prisoner required urgent and close care and attention it was Derek Ward.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I had received a letter in early January from Derek's father, Mr. John Ward, who is in prison in the United Kingdom.  He complained specifically about the cruel way Derek had been treated while in care in the United Kingdom.  More importantly, he expressed explicit concern for the boy's welfare and his state of mind.  He said:</P>
    <P>I am also very very concerned for the safety of the boy the state of his mind at this present time which I am most sure you will understand.  I pray you will tell the people that has the care of him to keep their eyes on the boy.  I am also writing to the police in charge of the case to watch the boy.  I will also write to the Bridewell courts a letter to the Judge in the case to be aware that I will hold the authorities responsible for the well being of my <Col N="533" /> son Derek.  I will have those letters that I write to those people photocopied so that they can't say they have not known the boy could be in danger from himself.</P>
    <P>So wrote Derek Ward's father on 1 January 1992.  A little over two months later Derek Ward did what his father believed likely &mdash; he took his own life.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Justice to carry out the fullest inquiry to establish whether any of the other authorities mentioned in the letter had received the correspondence from Mr. Ward alerting them to the dangers that he believed Derek was facing and to establish whether any of these letters were brought to the attention of the prison authorities and the doctors in charge of him.  One of the points expressed in successive replies from Ministers for Justice on this unfortunate phenomenon of death in prison is that the Minister is doing everything to accelerate the method of identifying people at risk and being able to respond to them.  Derek's father had written in clear and unambiguous language to all of the authorities who had charge of his son expressing his worries about the dangers involved to Derek.  If that letter had never been written, the facts surrounding this tragic man's life and leading up to his incarceration were of themselves clear indicators.</P>
    <P>The use of the window bars of the cell by people intending to commit suicide has been highlighted time and again, and this was the very way that Derek Ward took his life.  An immediate requirement is that no prisoner who, like Derek Ward, is identified as being at risk should ever be placed in a cell which has easy access to window bars.  More importantly, the admissions unit to supervise all prison admissions, as recommended by the advisory committee, must be established now without delay.  No prisoner like Derek Ward should ever be locked in a normal prison cell before or after trial. Derek Ward needed treatment, not punishment. <Col N="534" /> The psychiatric facilities in prisons must be expanded and developed even ahead &mdash; I say this advisedly &mdash; of the HIV or other medical units being planned.  I know that a medical unit specifically geared to deal with HIV is being considered if not being built in Mountjoy at present, but there has been a great deal of debate and discussion as to whether this is the way to deal with this category of prisoner.  I urge the Minister to consider adapting that particular building programme to the specific recommendation in the committee's report with regard to the admissions unit.</P>
    <P>Finally, if the death toll in our prisons is to be ended, the full recommendations of the Whitaker report on penal reform must be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, share the concern to which deaths in prison give rise. As for the death and the attempted suicide which have led to the debate this evening, I am sure the House will agree that the death of this young person in such tragic circumstances &mdash; whether it occurs in prison or in the community &mdash; is a matter of great regret and concern to all.</P>
      <P>The circumstances surrounding the death of this young man are as follows: On 30 December the youth, who was aged 19 years, was remanded by Dublin District Court to St. Patrick's Institution on a charge of murder, an offence which allegedly occurred on 28 December 1991. During his period of committal he was seen on a regular basis by the medical officer, the Department's psychologist and the visiting psychiatrist.  The prisoner was held under special observation, which means that he was checked by staff every 20 minutes over a 24-hour period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prisoner, when checked at 12.10 a.m. on 18 March 1992, was lying on his bunk.  When checked again 20 minutes later at 12.30 a.m., he was found by prison staff hanged in his cell.  The prison staff immediately took steps to resuscitate him.  He was taken directly to the <Col N="535" /> local hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.</P>
    <P>An inquest will take place into the death.  As the Deputy is aware, under the Coroner's Act, 1962, the coroner is an independent officer specifically appointed to investigate such deaths.  He may sit with or without a jury of independent citizens and may summon such witnesses, be they eye witnesses or expert witnesses, as he wishes to enable him or the jury to come to a verdict in the case. It is the function of the inquest to inquire not merely into the causes of death in the medical sense but to investigate all circumstances relating to the death.  This will therefore be an independent, statutory inquiry held in public and at this stage I am satisfied that no other public inquiry is called for.</P>
    <P>In addition to the inquest an internal investigation will be carried out by the suicide prevention group in the prison which was established following the recommendation of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths.</P>
    <P>Turning to general matters, deaths in custody are an unfortunate reality faced by prison administrations the world over. Because of the concern which deaths in prison understandably give rise to, my predecessor established in November, 1989 an advisory group to specifically examine this issue of deaths in prisons and to make recommendations in relation to any aspect of the matter.  The group fully appreciate the urgency which attached to their task but, given the enormously complex and sensitive issues which they had to address, it was clearly vital that they had sufficient time to enable them to deal with these matters comprehensively over whatever period proved necessary.  They presented their report in August of last year to the Minister and he published it in October.  In the six-month period that has elapsed since the publication of the report, and despite the talk there has been in some quarters of cosmetic changes and lack of <Col N="536" /> political will to do something about the situation, 26 recommendations have been implemented and I will now go through a number of these for the House.</P>
    <P>The introduction of 24-hour medical cover in our eight closed institutions was a major recommendation of the group. This has been done and it involved recruiting an additional 43 medically trained staff at a cost of over £500,000 per year.  Another major recommendation of the group was that increased psychological services be made available to prisoners. I am seeking to have the number of clinical psychologists increased from three to eight.  This will include the provision of a female psychologist for female prisoners, another recommendation of the group.  Effect has been given to another recommendation where counselling after a suicide will be available on a formalised basis for prisoners and staff alike who have been affected by the suicide. The installation of a cell-call system, whereby prisoners in distress can electronically alert staff has been completed. An alternative system of lighting to the present outdated system which disturbed prisoners while asleep, is being installed at present in the prisons.</P>
    <P>The Samaritans service has been introduced to our institutions and they are now involved in befriending prisoners in Cork, Loughan House, Mountjoy Male and Female and St. Patrick's.  They will shortly be in Limerick, Fort Mitchel, Spike Island and our new place of detention at Wheatfield.  We are also introducing a system whereby a cordless phone with a dedicated phone line to the Samaritans will be available to depressed, lonely or suicidal prisoners at all hours of the day.  The Samaritans have kindly made arrangements to have a dedicated phone line exclusively for distressed prisoners in custody.</P>
    <P>Lack of training for custodial officers in suicide awareness has been mentioned recently by commentators.  I am arranging, again, with the help of the Samaritans, that a two-day training course be <Col N="537" /> set up in the coming months.  This will cover the way a prison officer would relate to a distressed prisoner, the importance of active listening, being non-judgemental and non-directive, the stigma of suicide, bereavement, depression, sexuality and young people at risk.  Role plays and dynamic communication will be used to make the skills gained by staff as practicable and applicable as possible. This type of course, when fully developed, will be incorporated into induction training for all new recruits. These particular recommendations involve considerable expenditure and I am sure the House will agree that their implementation clearly shows the commitment to prison suicide prevention policy that this Government have.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations implemented to date are the setting up of a suicide prevention group in each institution, the review of special observation lists, improvements in committal assessment arrangements, introduction of and training in resuscitation equipment.  As I said previously, discussions have already taken place with the Eastern Health Board with a view to substantially improving the quality and quantity of psychiatric care for prisoners and additional moneys are being provided this year for that purpose.  Arrangements are also in train for the implementation of a further 13 of the advisory group's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations, such as the provision of a committal assessment centre, a new female prison, a new open centre for females, a unit to cater for psychiatrically disturbed violent prisoners, access to toilet and wash-up facilities on a 24-hour basis, provision of telephone facilities for prisoners, refurbishing and brightening of all prison buildings and exercise yards, are being fully taken into account in the context of overall development of the prison system.  The advisory group itself, recognising the cost and resource implications of these recommendations, and describing <Col N="538" /> them as being long term in nature, accepted that this may lead to a gradual approach to implementation.</P>
    <P>I could not end this evening without paying tribute to the prison service.  It performs a vital and complex role on behalf of society.  Prompt action by staff has helped to prevent 20 suicides already this year.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on these matters this evening. Obviously in the course of my reply, I have been able to deal with only some of the issues which have been raised.  I would like to say in conclusion to the House that every practical measure is being adopted to reduce suicides in prisons. We have a good report on the issue and we are pursuing a planned programme of action on the basis of that report.  Its implementation is a matter of the highest priority for me and my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Edenmore national school on Monday last and I thank you for allowing me to report to the House on the conditions pertaining there.  The first classroom I visited was that of Miss Gilsenan.  She has 34 pupils this year; next year she will have 38.  It measures 4.9 metres by 6.4 metres which is about 30 square metres.  The recommended size of classroom for that number of pupils is 55.5 square metres. There is a crack in the wall through which fumes from the boiler outside percolate, giving rise to an unhealthy atmosphere. This room is also beside the boys' toilets and in warm weather smells emanate from that quarter.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Murray teaches in the classroom next door where this year there are 37 infants.  It is too small for the purpose. Mrs. Murray will have 41 pupils in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal's room, that of Mr. McGreevy, is next door and he has 35 pupils.  The room is too small and the <Col N="539" /> blackboard is in the wrong position.  It cannot be seen by the students when there is a glare from the sun.  Of the 35 students, 20 are in fifth class and 15 are in sixth class.  I believe that mix of numbers is not satisfactory and creates difficulty for the teacher in charge and for the students who are trying to learn.</P>
    <P>The next classroom I visited, that in which Miss McCrudden teaches, is a 30 year old prefab.  Recently a steel support was put in place to keep the roof in position. The windows are rotten and the room is much too small for 35 pupils.  I think we would all agree that prefabs are not suitable accommodation for classrooms.  They are supposed to be short term temporary accommodation, yet 30 years later they are still in place.</P>
    <P>A remedial teacher was appointed last year on a sharing basis with other schools in the area.  Because of the difficulties at Edenmore national school the remedial teacher has to take her class in a small cloakroom.</P>
    <P>Teaching conditions are not good in Edenmore national school.  I compliment the staff who are doing an excellent job in very difficult conditions.  The number of students attending the school is 140, yet there is only one exit for that cohort, which, of course, is in breach of fire safety regulations.</P>
    <P>The school is surrounded on two sides by a river.  The play area in the yard is small; some of it is hard topped and some grassed.  On Monday last the grass part was very mucky and the students were covered in filth and dirt after they had been out for their break.  The yard needs to be hard topped.  I also checked the toilet area and found it to be inadequate; 74 boys are expected to find space in two bays.</P>
    <P>A new teacher has been sanctioned for that school and will take up duty in June. The question being asked in Edenmore is where will she teach.  No classroom is available at this stage.  I request the Minister this evening to undertake <Col N="540" /> immediately a building programme at this school.  Three new classrooms are needed, one to replace the existing prefab, a new classroom for the new teacher who is being appointed and an additional classroom which could be used while renovations are being carried out in the school to bring the present classrooms up to standard size.</P>
    <P>Against all the odds I found Edenmore national school to be a happy place.  We should not require pupils and teachers to work in conditions which are not conducive to learning and teaching.  That is a graphic description of what I found at Edenmore national school on Monday last.  I urge the Minister to put matters right without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining the Department of Education's position in relation to Edenmore national school, County Monaghan.  The Deputy has dealt with most of the factual elements in relation to the case, but I think it would be useful for me to outline the position from the Department's point of view.  The school has at present four teachers and I understand that the enrolments will entitle it to an additional teacher from next September.  The Deputy has dealt with this specific aspect in the text of his motion.  There is also a part time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The accommodation at the school consists of three permanent classrooms and a prefabricated classroom.  It is accepted fully that conditions at the school are not satisfactory and officials from the Department have met with the school authorities on a number of occasions to discuss the best way forward.  The school authorities were first of the view that a new school building would be the appropriate solution, but on reconsideration they indicated to the Department that a permanent extension would best suit their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> The following brief had been provisionally settled: an extension of two classrooms, a library-medical room, a staffroom and various stores and the conversion of the existing three classrooms into two standard classrooms.  The Department's architect has indicated that a small site extension would be required and the Department will be in touch with the school authorities outlining what is needed in this regard.  The school authorities have requested the provision of a general purposes room but it would not be possible to grant aid this facility in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Subject to a site extension being available the Department will undertake the architectural planning at the earliest possible date.  It is accepted that there have been delays in the matter, but the Deputy will appreciate that there is a large number of projects on hand and it is difficult for the Department to satisfy all the demands from the various school authorities, particularly having due regard to the question of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>Every school makes the case that its project merits priority treatment.  It is just not possible to achieve this.  I think the Deputy will understand this fully. However, it is hoped to have the Edenmore case expedited in so far as is possible.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of accommodation for the fifth full-time teacher the most expedient solution is the provision of a prefabricated classroom, especially as the accommodation would be needed by September 1992.  Indeed, this is standard practice now in the case of new appointments, particularly as it is uncertain how long the teacher will be required for.  It is possible that the school authorities may have different views in this respect and I have arranged for the Department to contact them to discuss the matter fully, at a meeting if desired.</P>
    <P>Finally, I understand completely the concerns of all those connected with the school, including teachers, parents etc., <Col N="542" /> and the Department will spare no effort in resolving the difficulties with the minimum of delay.  In view of the Deputy's interest he will be kept fully informed of developments.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture and Food. I propose to call the Deputies in the following order: Deputy Flaherty, Deputy Nealon and Deputy Sheehan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you would be glad to share this opportunity to raise the matter of the loss of jobs at Munekata Ireland Limited in Finglas.  We were all deeply concerned and disappointed when we heard that 140 jobs out of a total of 337 would be lost at that factory; a flagship industry in the Finglas area.  They recruited in the main leaving certificate graduates in the area and by achieving quality standards they were able to win markets from their competitors in Great Britain.  We are very proud of them.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that they have been experiencing difficulties for some time this is an enormous loss in terms of the number of jobs involved.  We are in a unique position, however, in that the Industrial Development Authority have a 10 per cent share in the firm as a result of an earlier company at the same location encountering problems.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the minimum number of jobs is lost.  I wish to pay tribute to Munekata Ireland Limited for adopting a familial paternalistic attitude towards the workplace and for moving slowly before coming to this decision.  I am aware that attempts were made to retain their employees in the hope that the recession would ease more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we are faced with a disastrous <Col N="543" /> situation.  Is the Minister satisfied that only the minimum number of jobs will be lost and can she assure us &mdash; this is just as important for the area &mdash; that the plant is viable and will be in a position to provide employment again as soon as the market improves?  What opportunities are available to relocate the skilled employees at other plants even though I have to accept that some jobs will be lost given the times in which we live?  Finally given the direct interest the Department have in this matter, via the Industrial Development Authority, what arrangements have been made in relation to the redundancy package being offered to those who must go?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flaherty for raising this matter.  Indeed, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has spoken to me about it also.  I share their concern about the difficulties being experienced by Munekata Ireland Limited which I am aware has been a fine employer in the area and has a fine track record with regard to their relationship with their workers and the standards achieved.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies concerned are aware of the history of the plant, there is no point in outlining the background to this case.  As Deputy Flaherty has said, and as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle informed me in his private conversations with me, the Industrial Development Authority are seeking to ensure that the number of redundancies is kept to a minimum. However, there is a world recession &mdash; we are tired of hearing this but it is the truth &mdash; and this type of industry depends to a great degree on external markets and marketing for their successes.  Having said this the Industrial Development Authority will continue to promote the Finglas area in relation to industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While they are not unique the Industrial Development Authority have a 10 <Col N="544" /> per cent stake in the company and will do everything possible to help this very valuable commercial firm which is going through a difficult patch.  I hope that when world conditions and external markets improve the plant will be poised to move forward bolstered by whatever plans can be put in place.  If there is a number of job losses involved the repercussions for any area would be serious but particularly so in this case given that the plant concerned is a flagship industry, as has been said.</P>
    <P>Given the Deputies' interest in the matter, I will contact the Industrial Development Authority tomorrow to speak to the chief executive and ask him to note the concern which has been expressed in the House, to keep a particular eye on the firm and help them through their rocky patch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his elevation which is long overdue.  The European Community buy-up scheme for milk quotas attracted a quota total of 10.5 million gallons, half of which came from the Connacht-Ulster area.  By definition, therefore, this half came from small farmers, people without big bank balances or resources.</P>
      <P>Many of these farmers face a temporary difficulty &mdash; a cash flow problem if one prefers to use that kind of terminology. Their milk cheques ended on 31 March, at the end of the milk year, but the first of their yearly instalments of their surrender money does not come until, in the words of the Department of Agriculture and Food who administer the scheme, &ldquo;in or about the month of August&rdquo;, a delightfully vague phrase if one is not waiting at the end of the road for the postman to come with a cheque &ldquo;in or about the month of August.&rdquo; There is a further problem in that many of these farmers seem to have got the impression that at least some of the money will be paid in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that this is an EC scheme with EC money administered by the <Col N="545" /> Department but I am sure the Minister of State will accept that there is a problem facing small farmers in Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo and many other areas who surrendered their quotas and who have now no cheques coming in until &ldquo;in or about the month of August&rdquo;.  That is a long wait and I appeal to the Minister of State to organise an early pay-out of the first moneys due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank Deputy Nealon for his kind good wishes on my appointment and also to thank him for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>The recently operated Community milk quota buy-up scheme, which involves the payment of five annual instalments of 41p per gallon to the producers who offered their quota for surrender, was the only legitimate way for producers during the milk year just finished to sell their milk quota without selling as well the lands to which the quota attaches.  It was made clear in the explanatory documentation in respect of the scheme that the premium would be paid over a period of five years, as already specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked my officials to ensure that the initial payment is made as early as possible this year.  However, the timing of the payment date is determined by a number of factors. 1.  The scheme is funded by the European Community. The funds are being made available in five annual instalments, with the first instalment being provided during the first quarter of the Community's 1993 FEOGA Year, which starts in mid-October 1992.  2.  It will also be necessary between now and the date of payment to verify the details provided by the applicants relating to quota and land ownership. In addition there is a legal obligation under the Community Regulations to ensure that before any payment can be made to eligible applicants under the scheme my Department must carry <Col N="546" /> out verification checks to prove that the production of milk has been totally and definitely discontinued.</P>
    <P>When the payment system is put in place I will review the timing of the issue of the payments for future years.  If it is found to be possible to bring forward the payment date the necessary arrangements will be made.  I agree fully with the views expressed by the Deputy in relation to the need to speed up payments of grants under all of these schemes.  Certainly I am committed to streamlining the system and expediting these payments to the best of my ability.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear a two minute statement from Deputy Sheehan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to wish the Minister the best of luck in his new office and I hope he will benefit the agricultural community in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the huge number of farmers who are deprived of the EC special beef grant owing to minor technical errors in either completing the application forms or disposing of some of their animals.  It is a matter for each member state to determine on such minor technical errors and make a decision on same.  In view of that will the Minister now give to the House an undertaking to certify all those outstanding claims for payment and have the cheques issued immediately to each applicant concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of those applicants waiting to have a decision made on their claims are farmers in very poor circumstances.  I need not remind the Minister of State how necessary it is that the Department should pay out those grants to those farmers. With rock bottom prices for cattle nowadays and obstacles in the way of development of agriculture, I appeal to the Minister of State to contact the Minister for Agriculture and Food and get him to adhere to the promises he made here on the night he was elevated as Minister for Agriculture and Food that <Col N="547" /> he would see that each and every case held up for investigation of minor technical irregularities will be dealt with sympathetically by the Minister and issue cheques immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that on the first occasion I have had to deal with a grievance question in the House I have the opportunity to respond to Deputy Sheehan and to say to him that there are only a few of us left.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Minister has given considerable priority to dealing with problems associated with the operation of the special beef premium scheme since taking office as Minister.  He accepted the recommendations in the interim report of the task force and arranged for overtime working in the local offices of the Department with the aim of speeding up payments under the 1991 scheme.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in paying premium grants and I expect that by the end of this week over 80,000 special beef premium payments will have been cleared.  This compares with a figure of 60,000 payments only three weeks ago. Since the Minister came into office on 14 February, over 40,000 grants have been paid and every effort is being made to clear the balance as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point made by Deputy <Col N="548" /> Sheehan that farmers are almost totally dependent on the payment of these grants.  In many instances, particularly those relating to the dry stock industry, the premium payment represents the only element of profit, if it could be called profit, in terms of the farming operation. I have no difficulty in identifying with Deputy Sheehan's points.</P>
    <P>Cases involving innocent error are being cleared for payment in line with the recommendations in the task force's interim report.  However, it will not be possible to pay all farmers at the end of the day.  This must be the case where substantially incorrect claims are made. I emphasise the word &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; because the Minister's instructions to the officials in the Department were to pay these grants and premiums in every case where it was possible for them to do so.</P>
    <P>My aim is to ensure that all legitimate claims are cleared as quickly as possible. I believe that major progress has been made in paying over the special beef premium and I expect a high rate of progress to continue in the coming days.  Every effort is being made to clear the backlog. We will do everything possible to ensure that the maximum number of grants are paid.  Unfortunately there will be a small number that, for very obvious reasons, cannot be paid by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 3 April 1992.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the recent report of a survey of telephone charges carried out by the Brussels-based consumers' organisation BEUC.  This survey found that for some services Telecom Éireann's charges are at the highest end of the countries surveyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I should mention that Telecom Éireann have a high cost structure principally because of the high level of debt, over £1 billion, which the company <Col N="466" /> must service and because the demographic structure of the area they serve involves a high average cost per line compared to other EC member states.  While bringing costs into line with our EC partners is desirable it is not, for these reasons, something which can be accomplished in the short term.  For example, I accept that international calls from Ireland are too high and that they will have to be reduced.  However, any reduction in international charges will have to impact in other areas and the most likely areas to be affected will be the charges for local calls which, I am informed by Telecom Éireann, are priced below cost in some cases at present.</P>
    <P>The initiative for proposing reductions in telecommunications charges lies with Telecom Éireann and I understand that the company are at present considering the options open to them to enable international calls to be reduced.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the Deputy that my predecessor agreed a package affecting local and trunk calls which took effect on 15 January last and which reduced the national telephone bill by an estimated £50 million.</P>

      <P>The operators of regional airports are currently experiencing difficulties in maintaining traffic levels through their airports as a result of the international recession in air transport which, over the last year or so, has particularly affected the level of services operated by carriers serving our regional airports.  1991 was a particularly difficult year, financially, for both the airlines and the airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> The services operated by Aer Lingus during the coming summer from the regional airports will be at the same level as summer 1991, except that a new daily early morning service will be introduced from Galway to Dublin with effect from 1 June 1992.  Ryanair services from Kerry county and Galway airports to London Stansted will this year be operated direct instead of through Waterford airport as formerly.  Loganair will operate three services per week from Carrickfin to Glasgow during the summer of 1992.</P>

      <P>Given the importance of competitive access fares for the development for tourism, Government policy on the level of air fares to/from regional airports, is that they should be competitive. While the level of any particular fare is essentially a matter for the airlines having regard to the economics of operating particular services, Aer Lingus and Ryanair accept this policy.  Furthermore, my Department constantly monitor fares charged by our airlines to ensure Government policy is adhered to.

    <P>It is the normal practice of my Department to deal with all queries relating to their activities in an open manner.  For my own part I intend to be as open and <Col N="470" /> forthcoming as possible in my dealings with the Oireachtas and with the many interest groups which operate in the areas for which my Department have responsibilities. The first example of this increased openness is in relation to the Shannon stop-over.  From the day I assumed the Tourism, Transport and Communications portfolio, I indicated that I wanted to take a totally open approach to this issue.  Those with an interest, vested or otherwise, in the Shannon stop-over, got a clear message from me &mdash; a message of openness.</P>
    <P>In the seven weeks since I made that intention clear, I have listened to presentations and deputations &mdash; as of today over 14 presentations and deputations.

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a table showing available CSO estimates of visitor numbers from our main markets in 1991.  The CSO do not prepare separate statistics for the Japanese market.  However, Bord Fáilte estimate that about 10,000 tourists from Japan visited Ireland in 1991.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report on Improving the Performance of Irish Tourism published in September 1987 were amongst a large number of factors taken into consideration by Government in devising their five year strategy for Irish tourism set out in the EC joint funded Operational Programme for Tourism (1989-93).</P>
      <P>The Government had particular regard to recommendations by Price Waterhouse in areas such as policy formulation, access, marketing and product development.</P>
      <P>Since 1988, in line with Government targets, visitor numbers have increased by 52 per cent; overseas revenue has increased to over £1 billion; and an additional 19,000 jobs have been created in the economy.</P>

    <P>Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer pay and pensions bill covers the actual cost to the Exchequer of the pay and pensions of civil servants, the Permanent Defence Forces, gardaí and teachers and varying amounts are included for pay in grants to health boards and other health agencies, noncommercial State-sponsored bodies and third level colleges.</P>
    <P>In relation to parts (b) and (c) of the question, the sectoral breakdown sought by the Deputy is not available for the years 1981-86.  A sectoral breakdown is, however, available for the years 1987-91 and this is set out for each year in Tables B-F which I am circulating with this reply. The &ldquo;Other Areas&rdquo; category shown on the tables refers mainly to the pay of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and some field staff of the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the Exchequer pay and pensions bill between pay and pensions for the years 1981-91 inclusive, is set out in the following table.  In order to have a consistent series, the pay expenditure for the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been excluded.</P>
    <P>Because of the impact of technical factors, i.e. factors other than increases in numbers of pay rates, such as annual increments, or the size of the Exchequer pay and pensions bill, year on year comparisons of the bill should be treated with caution.</P>
    <P>The pay of local authority staff is not included in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill.  The pay costs of civilian Defence Forces personnel are included in the following industrial Civil Service pay figures.</P>

      <P>The report of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths, which was published last October, <Col N="485" /> forms the basis of prison suicide prevention policy.  To date 26 of the group's recommendations have been implemented, including the extension of medical orderly cover involving the recruitment of 43 additional staff, the setting up of suicide prevention groups in each institution, the review of special observation lists, improvements in commital assessment arrangements, introduction of resuscitation equipment, access to prisons by the Samaritans, and the placement of distressed or suicidal prisoners in association and/or special cells.</P>
      <P>Two new designs of prison cell windows have been developed with a view to eliminating, in so far as possible, the use of cell windows and bars in suicide attempts.  A number of these windows have been installed in the new unit in Mountjoy and in the newly refurbished wing in St. Patrick's Institution.  These windows will be extended to other areas as refurbishment work is being undertaken. In-cell communications systems have also been installed in Mountjoy as recommended.</P>
      <P>Surveys relating to speed of access to cells, improved lighting, removal of structural features that could assist a prisoner in committing suicide have been carried out.  A review of temporary release arrangements has taken place and an improved method of statistical collection and analysis of incidents of inmate self-injury has been put in place.</P>
      <P>I am seeking to have the number of clinical psychologists for the prison system increased and discussions have already taken place with the Eastern Health Board with a view to substantially improving the quality and quantity of psychiatric care for prisoners and additional moneys are being provided this year for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements are also in train for the implementation of a further 13 of the advisory group's recommendations.  The remaining recommendations, some of which were envisaged by the group itself as being long term in nature, are being taken fully into account in the context of <Col N="486" /> overall development of the prison system.</P>
    <P>In regard to training, arrangements are being made to set up a two-day training course for prison officers with the expert help of the Samaritans.  This will cover the way a prison officer would relate to a distressed prisoner, the importance of active listening, being non-judgmental and non-directive, dealing with sensitive issues such as the stigma of suicide, bereavement, depression, sexuality and young people at risk, etc.  This type of course, when fully developed, will be incorporated into induction training for new recruits to the prison service.</P>
    <P>Resuscitation packs are being introduced into the prisons and in-house training on use of the pack will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>The level of training of medical orderlies is also being examined by the Director of Prison Medical Services and any additional training needs identified will be incorporated into the medical orderly training course.</P>

      <P>I am advised that in the Mid-Western Health Board area, payment is generally made to part-time home helps in respect of four week or five week periods.  The average payment at present is £103 which, when approximated with a rate per hour, would equate with £2.25 per hour.</P>

      <P>Under the 1970 Health Act medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and the income limits increase according to a person's age.  These guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card even if the statutory criteria are not met.</P>
      <P>While it would not be justifiable or fair to other groups, to extend the scheme to all deaf people without any regard for their means, I am satisfied that chief executive officers take a sympathetic view of applications from deaf people where their personal circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>Ireland's level of reporting of &ldquo;adverse <Col N="498" /> drug reactions&rdquo; (ADR) is in keeping with other countries and in particular with other EC member states who have voluntary reporting systems.  The pharmaceutical industry also provide a backup for the ADR voluntary reporting system, as the industry have a legal obligation to submit ADR reports (as a condition of the product authorisation under which a medicinal product is placed on the market).  Indeed, this country's contribution to the WHO drug monitoring programme has been praised by WHO for its consistent quality.</P>
      <P>A mandatory system for reporting would be impossible to police.  Furthermore, the quality of mandatory reports could not be guaranteed and therefore many would be unclassifiable and accordingly of no use in assessing a possible drug side-effect relationship.  I would add that no country, currently, has a mandatory system of reporting for practitioners.</P>

It is a matter for the corporation to nominate within their allocation of &ldquo;starts&rdquo; for the year which projects they will undertake.  The corporation have not nominated the scheme at Avila Park for commencement in 1992.  Consequently the issue of sanction at this stage does not arise.</P>
