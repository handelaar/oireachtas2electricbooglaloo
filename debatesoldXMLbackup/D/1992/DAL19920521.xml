      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Deasy.  I now call on Deputy Deasy to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed, Deputy.  The matter to which you refer is ongoing and Deputy Deasy or, indeed, any other Deputy, has ample opportunity to raise it under ordinary notice or by way of questions.  I understand that questions appertaining to agriculture will be heard in this House next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 12 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 12 if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 2.15 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment. It is also proposed that all Stages of No. 2, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for the Marine.  The Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of tomorrow's business, which shall be No. 6 &mdash; Votes 30 and 31 &mdash; the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the questions necessary to bring the proceedings on Votes 30 and 31 to a conclusion shall be put not later than 1.30 p.m. and 4 p.m. respectively; (ii) the speech of the Minister and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case, and the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes; (iii) a Minister of State may be called on a second time to make a speech in reply; (iv) a Minister <Col N="4" /> or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 1.20 p.m. and 3.50 p.m. respectively to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes; (v) in the five minutes preceeding such reply any Member may request the Minister to clarify specific issues during the course of his reply, and (vi) any division demanded shall be postponed until 6.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 May 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I would ask the Taoiseach to have a look at the possibility, in respect of item (v) which is the five minutes at the end for dialogue about Estimates, of increasing that time in due course to allow a somewhat longer time for a committee style discussion of the Estimates?  Five minutes is welcome but it is very short.  In regard to the events at Dublin Airport last evening, will the Taoiseach indicate a time frame for the promised legislation concerning the regulation of rights to information in view of the need to have clarity in fairness to all concerned and, particularly, to the Garda Síochána whose resources are scarce, as to what is and is not permissible in publications published within the State and imported into the State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to legislation that has been promised and discussed in this House, is the Taoiseach aware that he gave a written assurance to my colleague, Deputy Howlin, that the consensus in relation to travel and information would not be bridged by the Government between now and the introduction in the autumn of the Government's own Bill, or comprehensive set of measures, to deal with this matter? Accordingly, did any member of the Government, including the Attorney General, direct or instruct the Garda to act in Dublin Airport last night in the manner in which they did?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this morning of all mornings the Taoiseach should be in a position to make a statement in this House about the effective banning of an international newspaper.  Deputies are being denied the right to read this newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach, as the guardian of the rights of the Members of this House, would take steps to ensure that we have available to us here today copies of <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper. It is normally in the Library.  We <Col N="6" /> are in the ridiculous situation where Members of this House are not allowed to read an international newspaper.  We are living in an infantile theocracy; we are not living in a democracy at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is in the interests of all concerned that people know what the law is in regard to a matter of this kind, and that to say that this will be dealt with at the end of the year leaves us in a situation where nobody knows for sure what the law is now and in the meantime the law has to be enforced in a period of uncertainty? Could the Taoiseach agree to issue some guidelines as to what is the legal position now so that all concerned will know what it is?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Section 1 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of the definition of &lsquo;general dog licence&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory. During the course of the debate on Committee Stage on 4 March last Deputy Gilmore and I proposed that the concept of a general dog licence should be removed from the legislation because it facilitated far too much the owners or controllers of a number of dogs.  I also pointed out that a number of security companies in the city, involved in substantial business, could avail of this licence at little cost.  I have tabled another amendment which deals with the rate that should be charged, if this amendment is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that during the course of the debate on 4 March last the Minister gave an undertaking to consider the issues that had been raised before Report Stage. The amendments, which proposed that the concept of a general dog licence should be deleted entirely and that the <Col N="12" /> licence fee be increased from £200 to £1,000, were taken together for the purposes of debate.  I suspect that the Minister is not disposed to accede to our proposal in this amendment.  Nonetheless I would like to hear what consideration was given to the proposals and the points made during the course of the debate on Committee Stage and if he is prepared to accept the proposal at this stage.</P>

      <P>Clearly, Deputy Cotter has taken some inspiration from his Front Bench colleague, Deputy Noonan, who set the whole House on fire on Committee Stage when he made an unexpected contribution in which he referred to Siberian Tigers.  However, I should say that the problem to which the Deputy has referred will have to be dealt with under the muzzling regulations.  As I strongly indicated to the House during the debate on Committee Stage, I am looking at these regulations with a fresh mind and <Col N="13" /> it should be possible to relax the general regulations in relation to the decisions that were taken early last year.  I do not want to go any further than that because a wide range of issues will have to be taken into account and embraced in devising the regulations.  However, we will take account of the point made by the Deputy.  I cannot go any further than that at this stage.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate on Committee Stage I indicated to both Deputy McCartan and Gilmore that I considered the general dog licence to be a good one and that it was a must for anyone involved in breeding, training or minding dogs and where there was a constant turnover of animals.  It enables the person concerned to preserve the legitimacy of this operation without having either to licence each individual dog to check that the owner of each dog has a licence for that dog.  I referred in particular at that time to people going on holidays who make arrangements to have their dogs cared for while they are away.</P>
      <P>The present general dog licence under the 1986 Act is too loose in that it covers dogs kept at different premises.  The lighter form of general licence now proposed, which is confined to dogs kept at one premises, will mean that security firms and the like will no longer have a single umbrella licence for dogs kept at various premises.  It will also eliminate the possibility of a group forming an umbrella organisation and having one general dog licence to cover its members dogs.  With these defects eliminated the general dog licence will serve the purpose for which it was intended, that is, to enable genuine kennel owners to operate legitimately at a reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from the points made by Deputy McCartan on both Committee Stage and again this morning that he is of the opinion that this facility has been blatantly misused.  So far as I know, and I am subject to correction on this, there are only seven general dog licences in Dublin city and county.  I wish to assure the Deputy therefore that there is no need to be concerned, given the evidence <Col N="14" /> available to me.  I would like to keep the general licence for the purposes I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's approach.  Obviously, we will not be pushed through the barricades or call a vote on the issue, but I am of the view that it should be &ldquo;one dog, one licence&rdquo; and that on occasion people in the business of breeding or minding dogs, in particular security companies, do get a licence and run their business on the cheap.  That was unfair and inequitable to the ordinary person who owned more than one dog.  It was also unfair to the general public.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the definition of &ldquo;dogs kept at various premises&rdquo;.  I know that security companies often deploy their dogs on factory premises and leave them there for a major part of the day.  Will they be considered to be kept at those premises or the kennels in which the security company are based?  However, I take the point that as so few people avail of the general licence, it is not a major problem. In those circumstances I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> I am fulfilling an undertaking I gave on Committee Stage to consider proposals by Deputy Carey to provide for licences longer than one year.  As the House knows, Deputy Carey represents a constituency in the mid-west&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carey is an extraordinarily difficult man to handle; I have to go so far as I can to meet his wishes, otherwise I will be under mortal threat. I have considered the proposal and acknowledge the merits of the case for having an optional longer licence.  The effect of these amendments will enable me to specify in regulations the periods in respect of which a multi-annual licence may be issued.  I have not considered in detail what these periods might be but I will consider the three, five and ten year options suggested on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I relation to amendment No. 3, I undertook on Committee Stage to consider before Report Stage a suggestion by Deputy Carey that provision be made for a three, five or ten year licence &mdash; or even a licence for the lifetime of a dog. The main argument for a multi-annual licence is that it would remove the need of having to buy a new licence every year; it would thus offer dog owners the choice of opting for an ordinary dog licence or a general licence for the standard 12 months' period set out in the 1986 Act or for any longer period which may be prescribed by the Minister by regulations. Accordingly, it would be open to the Minister to provide for a three, five or ten year licence or for any other period deemed appropriate by the Minister. Although the amendment could, in theory, allow for a licence for the lifespan of a dog, it must be pointed out that there would be difficulties in assessing the lifespan of different types and classes of dogs.  For that reason, such a licence might not be a practical proposition. However, this aspect can be looked at again when regulations are being made. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are consequential to amendment No. 3 which <Col N="16" /> introduces the concept of multi-annual licences.  They provide that increased fees of £10 for an ordinary dog licence and £200 for a general dog licence are applicable for each year of the validity of both types of licences.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 is not acceptable because a general dog licence fee of £1,000 is unrealistically high and would almost certainly mean that no one would buy such a licence.  With the fee for an individual dog licence set to increase to £10 under this Bill, a person would need to own or keep 100 dogs or more before it would be economic to opt for a general licence.  There is a place for a general dog licence for persons heavily involved in keeping dogs but it must be set at a reasonable and realistic level.</P>
    <P>The fee for the general licence has been maintained at ten times the price of the ordinary dog licence since 1984 and there are compelling reasons, in present day circumstances, to alter this ratio.  I hope Deputies will apppreciate that we have given some consideration to the proposals made on Committee Stage; Deputy McCartan will appreciate that, in the context of the number of general licences granted, it is unrealistic to expect any reasonable success in the future by an increase of the order he suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's three amendments and I acknowledge that he has taken on board points made by Deputy Carey and others on this side of the House on Committee Stage. It is a step in the right direction.  While the Minister should reserve power to himself to set, by regulation, the sort of periods for which licences can be granted, I am still worried about the use of the money raised by licence fees.  Will the Minister clarify whether the money raised by dog licence fees will be given to local authorities to offset the cost of implementing this and other laws in relation to the control of dogs?  It is important to make clear that the funds raised from dog licences will be used to offset their cost in implementing the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in this House for 15 years <Col N="17" /> and my experience has been that when we enact legislation, it is not enforced because there is inadequate provision in that regard.  It is a harmful exercise to enact legislation and not to enforce it and it would be a great pity if that happened in this case.  We all know that the money received for parking fees or in fines for transgression of traffic laws are not assigned to local authorities to help them to enforce traffic laws or to implement other traffic control measures.  We must ensure that moneys raised in respect of legislation similar to this Bill by means of licence fees should be assigned to the local authorities concerned to help them to implement such legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendments because it is good in principle that people are allowed to obtain a licence for longer than 12 months.  I do not have any difficulty regarding the range of times available; the average life of a dog is not very long, nonetheless it is a good idea in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue which causes me concern is the rejection out of hand by the Minister of amendment No. 6 which refers to the general dog licence.  The figure of £200 is unrealistically low.  The Minister suggested that there are only seven general dog licences in the city, he was very careful not to mention west Clare or other places and to say how many exist outside the city.  When one considers the greyhound breeding industry and other dog breeding industries, I imagine there are many outside the city confines.  Certainly in Dublin city the general dog licence is availed of primarily by security and there are at least two &mdash; I mentioned their names on Committee Stages but they are not relevant now &mdash; which each houses in excess of 100 dogs.  It was because of my awareness and information in regard to these two companies that I pitched the figured at £1,000 because they would be paying something commensurate with their scale of business.  If the Minister thinks the sum of £1,000 is excessive &mdash; he has a reasonably cogent argument in that regard &mdash; I would be happy to compromise, but £200 is extremely low. <Col N="18" /> For a specific concept made available to the industries of breeding, minding or training, as the Minister explained, and also of security, which the Minister did not mention, we should arrive at a more realistic figure having regard to the profits that can be made.  Deputy Mitchell has said that the dog control services are severely strapped in terms of their effectiveness. That is primarily because of an absence of funding.  The licence fee is an important source of revenue in that regard.  A more stringent approach should be taken in relation to the fee levied on large concerns whose objective is to make profit rather than keep dogs for pleasure.</P>
    <P>I have talked about the domestic household that might have two, three or four dogs for pleasure or for home security.  The general dog licence would be of no particular benefit there in that it would be more economic for that household to buy four single dog licences. The general dog licence is specifically designed to deal with a bigger commercial enterprise, in whatever way it is operated.</P>
    <P>I should be happy if the Minister were prepared to consider a figure a little higher than the £200 provided for.  In the interests of consensus this morning, I am certainly not going to insist on the suggested figure of £1,000 but it is my view that the Minister should reconsider the scale of the fee.</P>

      <P>I also wish to acknowledge the Minister's goodwill in accepting the proposals made on Committee Stage.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall first reply briefly to the points raised by Deputy Mitchell.  For <Col N="19" /> the past few years there has clearly been a deficit between the amount raised from dog licence fees and the expenditure incurred by local authorities in the discharge of their duties under the provisions of the 1984 legislation.  Last year approximately £1 million was spent by local authorities, yet the income received from dog licence fees approached only £750,000.  It is clear that additional moneys are required even if local authorities ensure that the funds collected in dog licence fees are used exclusively for the purposes of the dog warden service. That is why I indicated on Committee Stage that I was extremely anxious that many more dog owners pay their licence fees.  On Committee Stage I said that only a very little more than one-third of this country's dog owners actually paid for a dog licence.  If people met their legitimate requirements under the legislation much greater resources would be available to enhance the warden service.</P>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy McCartan chose to use County Clare as an example when talking about general dog licences. However, in 1989 there were no general dog licences in Clare and in 1990 there was one.  Limerick had about 25 general dog licences and Cork had 47.  Throughout the country there were between two and six general dog licences held in different areas.  In 1989 there was a total of 143 general dog licences and in 1990 there was a total of 169.</P>
      <P>The £5 fee for the ordinary dog licence and the £100 fee for the general dog licence were prescribed in 1984, almost ten years ago.  It is now time for those fees to be reviewed.  In the light of the experiences and the range to which the dog warden service now have to extend, increases of the order prescribed under the Bill should be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy McCartan's final point, I wish to say that in this regard, as with all provisions, we have to try to find a balance.  The Deputy clearly has a very strong view about what might be termed the commercial aspects of keeping dogs for security businesses.  I ask the Deputy to consider alongside his arguments the <Col N="20" /> great many dog owners involved in showing dogs, perhaps in the international arena as well as here at home.  The show life for those dogs is very short and many of the owners have a great love for and a great interest in caring for their dogs in a special way when they are old and need attention.  A balance has to be found between the considerations of the more commercially orientated businesses and the genuine owners who are involved in caring for several dogs after their potentially commercial life is finished.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the figures given indicate that if everyone who should do so applied for a general dog licence more general dog licences would issue.  The Deputy might agree that if there were a chance of succeeding in that regard with the licence fees prescribed by legislation the possibility of success should be more enhanced by my proposals than the more expensive fees suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>One behalf of Deputy Gilmore and myself, I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 20, after &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in particular, shall have regard to the size, weight and breed of dog and to have regard to the use for which the dog is kept&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to add to the provision contained in the <Col N="21" /> new section 3 (2) (c) proposed by the Minister.  This provision gives the Minister a general power to vary the rates to be levied for a licence that can be charged by the Department or local authorities in respect of classes of dogs and classifications generally.  I contend that the additional words should be added to make it incumbent on the Minister to have particular regard to the size, weight and breed of dog and to have regard to the use for which a dog is kept.</P>
    <P>My reason for tabling this amendment is that the licence does not constitute merely a question of controlling individual dogs in particular circumstances.  I contend the licence should be used by Government, if you like, in pursuance of a policy in the interests of the community at large.  The weighting should be against breeds of dogs that are not generally welcome or that do not have any specific use within a community at any given time. The Government should be working to encourage people to avoid keeping oversized or large dogs as pets in domestic dwellings and, therefore, accommodated within the immediate community.  If people living in urban areas are disposed to keeping dogs in their homes &mdash; I am not one of them &mdash; there should be some regard to the confinement of the overall area of the dwelling itself and/or back garden.  I heard the proposition being advanced recently that one aspect of the Government's plan for social housing would not be suited to the Dublin region in that there is not much space provided with the standard local authority house for house extensions, that the design of rural dwellings and availability of land affords much greater overall space.  That should have some impact on the size of animals kept by people in their homes, as should the urban landscape generally.</P>
    <P>At times it is very disturbing to encounter very large breeds and cross-breeds of dogs that appear to serve no particular use or function.  If people's objective in owning a dog is for enjoyment or pleasure size should not be a great consideration. I contend the Department should play a positive, active role in this respect.  One way in which they could do so is by penalising <Col N="22" /> the owner of a larger, heftier, more aggressive type dog but also be in a position to penalise people in respect of the purposes for which dogs are kept.  That is one aspect that could be examined.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage it was proposed that the weighting might be in favour of elderly people who kept a dog for companionship or security purposes, that that is something that could be positively encouraged in the manner in which the fees are struck.  I think the proposition was advanced &mdash; and I would certainly do so &mdash; that elderly people, of pensionable age should be entitled to hold a dog licence without paying a fee.  That is something for which the Minister could provide under the provisions of section 3 (c).</P>
    <P>After the enactment of this Bill the Minister will have available to him power to deal with the introduction of regulations. It is that in particular that has dog owners, to the extent that they are organised nationwide, extremely worried. They are extremely concerned at the extent to which the Minister can, for example, ban certain breeds from entering the country, demand or insist on the destruction of certain breeds already here and provide for the muzzling of certain breeds of dogs in specific circumstances. Perhaps one way of overcoming or addressing many of the problems that have manifested themselves through the arrival here of many very undesirable breeds of dogs would be for the Government to begin to use the licence as a type of penalty to discourage the acquisition of such breeds.  In such circumstances the average person endeavouring to decide to acquire a domestic pet would also have to bear in mind that if and when they acquire a puppy that may ultimately grow into an animal of or over a certain size, or of a particular breed, it will be more costly.  I do not contend that would resolve the problem fully but, in time, it would have some impact on the manner in which people would acquire certain breeds of dogs as opposed to others. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Minister when he seeks to vary the licence, as is being provided <Col N="23" /> for here.  I hope he will be agreeable to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point Deputy McCartan makes with regard to built-up areas, where there is much confinement in terms of freedom or allowing dogs enjoy themselves in the normal way.  It is a consideration that should be borne in mind by people in such areas in terms of their acquisition of dogs as pets.  Very often such circumstances can be very frustrating not alone for their owners but also for the dogs themselves if there is not a reasonable degree of freedom.  It is part of the nature of a dog and something we must endeavour to bear in mind.  I would be very reluctant to go beyond a suggestion of that kind.  As I understand it, no more than in human life, size and/or ambition do not necessarily relate one to the other.  Certainly in my hurling or football days I never had any less fear of a six footer or somebody of 6'5&ldquo; than somebody who may have been a foot smaller who could impact in a more severe manner.  If one carries that logic through in terms of dogs, a St. Bernard, say, would be regarded as a heavyweight but, in terms of viciousness, not much of a threat whereas a bull terrier would be much lighter but pose a much greater threat in terms of viciousness.  As the House will know, in terms of reported accidents to children, facial injuries and so on, again size is not anything like the factor people might think.  To that extent the Deputy will appreciate that the question of viciousness and dangerous dogs is a difficult one.  It would be extremely difficult if I were obliged, in drawing up regulations, to take account of everything in regard to weight, size and so on.  I happen to like dogs very much myself.  I know of a number of elderly dog owners who have grown used to their pets, some quite large, which are in no way dangerous but rather form part of such people's daily lives.  I would not like to introduce regulations which would create greater financial difficulty for such people. People's attachment to dogs is not something that can be related to size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> At the beginning I said I should like to cultivate a greater interest in smaller dogs more easily managed and maintained particularly in very built-up areas where there would not be the same degree of freedom for the larger type of breed.  But to go beyond that in legislative terms I contend would be unacceptable and extremely difficult to determine in any fair or reasonable manner.  I hope Deputy McCartan will appreciate that I have indicated on a number of occasions, when it comes to defining the regulations, I intend releasing from the muzzling regulations quite a number of categories but it will still be necessary to keep dogs on leads in public places.  Therefore, there will be a flexible, measured way of dealing with this.  After reconsideration I think Deputy McCartan will realise that, in legislative terms, to oblige me to take account of all the points he has made would be unnecessarily difficult and indeed would interfere with some of the people for whom he, like me, is endeavouring to cater.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the possibility of having a different scale of licence fees for dogs owned by elderly people.  I looked closely at this matter to see if we could help these people in some way. However, I do not think such a system would be feasible.  Unfortunately, we continually run into difficulties in respect of categories which have been exempted. I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the difficulties which can arise in regard to concessions which are given in other areas.  At present young people do not own anything in the home; everything belongs to the elderly people.  If we could reach some kind of consensus in respect of such concessions I would find it easier to commit myself to helping these people. Unfortunately, such concessions tend to be unnecessarily exploited.  This means we are not able to cater for the genuine person in the way that we should.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands will give me a fair degree of freedom in dealing with the various classes of dogs.  I will take into account the points which have been made by the Deputy.  I ask him not to make my tasks impossible by proposing that the <Col N="25" /> different classes of dogs would be determined on the basis of weight.  There is a big difference between a large dog who poses no threat to the public and a small dog who can be very vicious.  The Deputy's amendment would make it almost impossible to determine the licence fee in any fair and reasonable way.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his eloquent response.  I am not entirely convinced that there is not a close relationship between the size of a dog and the threat it poses to the public.  As an urban dweller, I would not contemplate having a dog in my home.  I was reared in a non-urban environment where there were many dogs.  While it is possible to give a small dog a kick and thus solve many of the problems it is not possible to do this to large dogs, although I have often tried it.  For that reason the Government should promote the keeping of smaller breeds of dogs in urban environments. I fully accept the points made by the Minister in his response.  It is easy to see that he has had regard to the representation made to him by the dog owners' and dog breeders associations and others.</P>
      <P>I accept the point that the elderly person in the home becomes the owner of everything.  Nevertheless, I believe the Minister should address the issue of pensioners living alone.  Under our social welfare code a free telephone allowance and a free electricity allowance is given to elderly people living alone.  This system works reasonably well and is quite specific. In the context of this provision regard should be had to the fact that in many cases dogs become the friends of elderly persons and offer them security. Perhaps the Government should promote the keeping of dogs by elderly people so that they would have a companion and feel more secure in their homes.  I appreciate the Minister has not been entirely deaf to the points which have been made.  I do no intend to press my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution in subsection (1) of &lsquo;on a lead or chain while in public places&rsquo; for &lsquo;under effectual control&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment.  The Minister in an earlier response indicated that the regulations would require people to keep dogs on a lead when in public places.  The Principal Act provides that animals should be kept under effectual control while in public places.  Wardens working in the service in Dublin have told me that they have major difficulties in implementing this provision in practice. If they confront dog owners in a public place and say that the dog should be kept on a lead the person may say that he can summon the dog to heel and he will come, that he is effectively under his control.  There have been a number of confrontations between wardens and dog owners about what is and is not control. The word &ldquo;control&rdquo; needs to be specifically defined in the Bill.  This amendment proposes that the Principal Act be amended to read that a dog should be kept on a lead or chain while in public places. That is what we mean by control in a public place.</P>
      <P>Many dog owners bring their dogs into public parks, take off their leads and let them run about freely.  This is wrong. Public parks are places to which people go for peace and quiet.  Unfortunately, public parks are used time and again by dog owners as exercise tracks for their dogs.  I understand that the larger the dog the more vigorous he can be.  Even though a dog may be very quiet he can get so excited at the prospect of being able to run about he will take off heedlessly around a park.  If there is a two or three year old child in his way he may knock him.  This is not done out of any bad intent; it is done simply out of excitement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the position is in <Col N="27" /> Limerick, west Clare or Dundalk but the Dublin Corporation by-laws covering public places make it an offence for people to exercise their dogs in public parks and open spaces.  This is done for very good reasons.  We all know that very friendly dogs of whatever size can run up to sunbathers on a beach, sniff around, give them a lick and run off again. However, this can scare many people.  If people react quickly it is possible that the dog may misinterpret the reaction and a different scenario will develop.  It is important that we enable wardens and park caretakers to deal properly with dog owners who say their dogs will come back when they are called.  As I said, anything can happen while dogs are running about. Public parks and places of recreation are not dog exercise tracks.  Therefore, it is important that dog owners are made aware that they have to keep their dogs on a lead or chain while in public places, and not just under effectual control.</P>
    <P>Wardens in Dublin have spoken to me about the difficulties they have in dealing with people who have their dogs on extendable leads.  I do not know whether the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Minister are aware that people walking with their dogs in public places carry contraptions whereby if they release a button the dog can run for a certain distance.  If the owner wants to call the dog back closer he presses the button and the extendable lead contracts much the same as a measuring tape.  These devices are very commonplace in Dublin.  Occasionally dog owners walk on the outside of the footpath while the dog, although on a leash walks on the inside with the result that the leash gets tangled around pedestrians. Originally I intended suggesting that the length of the leash should be a matter for this legislation, but on balance I would be happy with the requirement that every person walking a dog in public should have the dog on a chain or a leash. That is a fundamental requirement in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound entirely anti dog-owner.  Dublin Corporation are attempting to address this problem at <Col N="28" /> present.  The regulations and by-laws that exists with regard to dog control in open spaces enjoys the support of all parties in the city council.  It is an offence for dogs to be allowed run free in public parks. We are considering the reservations of spaces, compounds or fields where dog owners can bring their animals where they can have all the fun they want.  This is a problem, particularly in urban areas. It does not apply to rural areas because there are many fields in these areas and on the outskirs of small towns where people can let their dogs run free.</P>
    <P>I make this plea having spoken to the warden service in the city who say that they have difficulty in implementing this provision because much debate is put forward as to what is effectual control.  I suggest that we omit this nebulous phrase and insert a specific requirement that a dog in a public place be on a chain or a lead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy McCartan is undoubtedly one of the most accomplished and able Members of this House I think he is talking a lot of baloney in this regard.  He has given a clue to the fact that he is not a dog lover and, from listening to what he said, he could not possibly have owned a dog. To impose regulations of the nature he suggested on the hundreds of thousands of dog owners in the country would be absolutely farcical, cruel and totally unrealistic.  To say that there are fields on the outskirs of the city where people can let their dogs loose is farcical.  While I accept that this is a city problem we have to legislate for the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am an animal lover, though maybe an unlikely one.  I view with concern the regulations the Minister intends to bring in.  While I accept that control of dogs is a necessity, this legislation is a knee-jerk reaction to hysterical reporting in the media, mainly the English media, of attacks by dogs on children.  Children have been attacked by dogs throughout the centuries, and it will always happen. As an Irish citizen I would be more concerned with attacks by human &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; on the street.  I would never be afraid of a <Col N="29" /> dog but I would be afraid of the criminals who wander the cities and towns of Ireland.  I fear that this measure would be an invasion on hundreds of thousands of people who enjoy the pleasure, loyalty, fidelity and affection of dogs.  While I accept that there are dangerous breeds of dogs which have to be controlled, the Minister should take full cognisance of the submission of the Irish Kennel Club which is a very measured and balanced one.  In future legislation he should involve the Kennel Club, a most responsible group who understand dogs, unlike Deputy McCartan who, from his contribution, obviously fears them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address himself to the problem of who will implement these regulations.  The local authorities cannot and will not do so because they do not have the manpower.  Neither will the Garda Síochána who in most cases do not have a humane dog killer in their stations should a dog be injured on the streets or the roads of Ireland.  I view with concern this intrusion on the rights of people to own dogs.  Obviously there are dogs which need control and there are dogs which need to be banned from this country. The importation of South American bred dogs purely for fighting should not be countenanced.  The Minister should be much more concerned about the illegal activities of people who use dogs for dog baiting and dog fighting.  There are reported incidents of an increase in that activity.  Dogs are being bred specifically for that purpose in the Border area. There are reports of much cruelty, with dogs fighting to the death, which is unacceptable. The killing of badgers and foxes by vicious dogs is wrong, too, and is a matter in which the Garda Síochána should be involved.</P>
    <P>I oppose Deputy McCartan's amendment. It is totally unrealistic to expect people to keep dogs in country areas on a lead, particularly dogs which have been companions for ten or 12 years and which are totally docile.  That would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Every debate shows differences of opinion.  There is a necessity <Col N="30" /> for people to weigh up the balance between the conflicting positions taken by Opposition Deputies.  I would not agree with Deputy McGahon in his remarks on Deputy McCartan.  There are three or four Deputies in this House who are interested in this Bill and I am not going to decide who are dog lovers. However, I appreciate contributions, support and differences of opinion which will enable us to devise laws and, subsequently, regulations which will deal with the complexity of the matter before us.  Deputies will appreciate that there is a wide range of views on this matter.  I would like to think that the position in the city of Dublin is as Deputy McGahon seems to think.  I regret that in some cases dangerous dogs are allowed too much freedom and there is a threat to children and people in public parks, which is not acceptable.  That is why these laws are being introduced.  I am delighted to hear from Dublin Corporation &mdash; this matter has also been emphasised by Deputy McCartan &mdash; that the by-laws that are presently being devised will require people to keep their dogs under effective control.  The local authorities are considering special arrangements whereby facilities will be available to dog owners to exercise dogs.</P>
      <P>The number of people who pay for dog licences would not be the best criteria in deciding who cares for dogs, because there are very caring people who for one reason or another do not have dog licences.  Only one-third of dog owners pay their licences.  There are a great number of people who neglect their dogs which become fierce for one reason or another.  We would not introduce these laws and the regulations unless there was a problem.  It is not fair to say that this is just a knee jerk reaction to highly publicised events relating to injuries inflicted on children and others by vicious dogs. We need the kind of laws and regulations which will enable people to use public parks, roads and streets without being placed under threat from dogs.  At the same time we are having a flexible and measured approach which takes account of various situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> I indicated on the last occasion that I am not in favour of having all dogs on leads.  That is not necessary in a great number of cases. On the last occasion I also emphasised the difference between rural areas and cities and I instanced the case of a herd owner and a dog managing the herd on the public road.  Such a dog would be worthless if he had to be kept on a lead.  We cannot manage this in the terminology that would be required in a definition in law.  This can be dealt with in the by-laws which can be implemented by each local authority, taking account of the circumstances and what is required in their area.  In a highly built up area with little space there has to be more confinement but in the open areas there can be more freedom.  Even within the built up areas there are loving dog owners who have small pets who roam about and are not a great threat to anybody.  Taking all that into account it is not necessary to go down the road that Deputy McCartan and Deputy Gilmore's amendment suggests. Where such restrictions are necessary the local authorities can provide the necessary by-laws.  I doubt if even in the most confined places such restriction would be an absolute requirement.  For that reason and because of the wide considerations which I have to take into account in devising legislation I find the amendment unnecessary.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty in enforcing regulations.  I have some sympathy with what Deputy McCartan is trying to do.  There are people who are absolutely careless about controlling their dogs.  I am not saying that the Minister, Deputy Flynn, was absolutely careless <Col N="32" /> that day on the strand in Mayo, but will there be some method of enforcing such regulations to ensure that these controls are effective in local authority areas?  The Minister has not said that there will be inspectors to monitor the control of dogs.  I would like a reassurance on that because, sad to say, the Minister's dog has been involved in another incident since I spoke here last on this.</P>

Will the Minister give some sort of indication that the Department will have some power, although it may not meet what Deputy McCartan is seeking?  Will there be some sort of supervision of control when the regulations are in force?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and the Deputies for their useful contributions. In order to put the record straight, I owned my first dog when I was about six and in the course of my life I have owned four and have lived in a house at a time when there was a minimum of six dogs in it.  It is because I am a dog lover that I refused to own a dog when I came to the city to live.  It is entirely unnatural and unfair to dogs to keep them in confined spaces in urban surroundings.  My approach to this issue comes directly from my experience of living for the past 25 years in the city and of representing a constituency where dogs are a problem.  They roam in large numbers around working class estates where they are completely uncontrolled and where they are a menance much of the time.  In this city we had a number of prosecutions of people who were keeping dogs for their own gratification for dog baiting and dog fighting.  The House will recall the sad case of people in a van being pursued and the dog warden finding half <Col N="33" /> mutilated and dying dogs in the back of it.  It is unbelieveable to think that this goes on, but it does.  I recall a Dublin Deputy coming in here to complain on the Adjournment about gardaí not being able to get into a barracaded flat to deal with drug dealers because they were using dogs to keep the gardaí back, and the gardaí had no way of dealing with them.  This is the problem.  I have no fears of dogs and anyone who has canvassed the Dublin constituencies with me will vouch for that.  When we come to a house with a dog in the garden they send in McCartan.  I have survived it so far and hope I will continue to do so.  Nevertheless, I understand the difficulties.</P>
      <P>I had intended in resubmitting this amendment to deal with the urban-rural divide.  I have the fullest regard for the drover on the road or the man with a good sheepdog.  It is preposterous to suggest that these animals could work on a leash.  Deputy McGahon made the point that this legislation will apply over the Twenty-six Counties.  We have to get some kind of order in the control of dogs because of the phenomenon of dangerous dogs running wild in communities and the menace they can represent to people lawfully enjoying public spaces.  The bad case makes it tough for everyone and it is the law-abiding person with the well-behaved dog who is most aggrieved by these kinds of provisions.  The dog warden can only work effectively from a single standard.  He or she may identify a dog which should be on a lead and seek to find the owner.  The wardens find it very difficult on occasion to operate under the existing legislation which refers to effectual control.  There are rows with dog owners who are aggrieved by being challenged because their dogs, while not on a leash, are close at heel or running about under close surveillance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have adopted by-laws under the 1986 Act for the Dublin city area which have received support on all sides of the city council.  It is provided that a person in charge of a dog in a specified area shall keep the dog on a leash while in that area.  The areas referred to include a park, garden, open <Col N="34" /> space, fields, stadium and other places used for outdoor recreation and sporting activities which are under the control of the corporation.  We are making it an absolute standard in any area of public recourse over which we have control that a dog be on a leash.  That is an illustration of how we have reacted to everyday experiences in the city.</P>
    <P>I kept my amendment specific.  I am happy the Minister has said it will be a matter under regulation for each local authority to deal with the phenomenon. I hope the local authorities will address the issue from a realistic standpoint.  The reality to be borne in mind is the difficult job that wardens are being asked to do and the need to move from the bad case to the general.  That is the way the law is forcing us.  This debate has been very useful and I am glad to have had the opportunity to put on record my own experience and history of dogownership.</P>

      <P>In page 3, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Section 11 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (2) of &lsquo;without a warrant&rsquo; after &lsquo;dwelling&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arises from specific difficulties experienced by the dog warden service. I propose that section 11 of the Principal Act should be amended by including the right of wardens to enter a dwelling without a warrant.  Under existing law all premises other than a dwelling may be entered without a warrant by a warden in pursuit of his or her duties.  If he or she observes or receives a report of an attack by a dog on a person or if he or she is pursuing a dog without a licence with a view to apprehending it, having the authority to impound such animals, he or she can follow the animal and enter upon any premises other than a dwelling. That is the advice they have received from their legal advisers.  It seems an <Col N="35" /> unnecessary restriction.  The Minister should have regard to this proposal that we give authority to wardens to enter premises, including a dwelling where necessary, with a view to apprehending a dog that is wild or a threat or is without a licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that this amendment is unnecessary.  Section 11 of the 1986 Act allows a member of the Garda Síochána to enter any premises other than a dwelling to seize and detain a stray dog.  The insertion of the words proposed is therefore deemed not necessary. The Department's legal adviser has confirmed that having regard to the powers of dog wardens and the gardaí to enter premises under section 11, putting in the words &ldquo;without a warrant&rdquo; would have no practical effect.  The Department have also confirmed with the dog warden services of the ISPCA that they are not aware of particular difficulties or problems experienced by dog wardens in the operation of section 11 of the 1986 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a regrettable scenario.  The specific advice that the dog wardens in Dublin have received from their independent legal advisers is to the effect that wardens do not have the power to enter dwellings.  The document prepared by counsel for the service states in relation to a dog warden's powers as follows:</P>
      <P>He may enter any premises (other than a dwelling):</P>
      <P>A.&nbsp; In order to prevent or end an attack by a dog upon a person or the worrying of livestock;</P>
      <P>B.&nbsp; Which are registered with the relevant local authority pursuant to regulations made by the Minister for the Environment in respect of premises where more than five dogs over the age of four months are kept;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>C.&nbsp; Where he has reasonable grounds for believing that more than five dogs aged over four <Col N="36" /> months are kept, and therein examine the dogs and their quarters.</P>
    <P>That is in respect of kennels and such places.  The document continues:</P>
    <P>The powers referred to in the previous paragraph may be regarded as exhaustive.  A dog warden should not regard himself as having, in addition to these powers, any greater power of arrest, search, seizure or indeed, investigation than any other citizen. Should he presume to do so, he leaves himself and his employer open to civil court action, judicial review and possibly even criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>That is the advice given by a barrister to dog wardens in the Dublin area.  The very fact that they have sought that independent legal advice is symptomatic of another problem which Dublin Corporation are attempting to address. There seems to be a regrettable divergence of interests and views emerging between the dog warden service on the one hand and, on the other hand, the association the Minister sought to consult, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  The society acts as the agent for most local authorities in the operation of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>To illustrate my point, the Minister will be aware that, as Deputy McGahon has mentioned already, no dog warden service in the country has a humane killer or any device for putting down vicious or dangerous animals.  On Committee Stage I recounted an incident where two dog wardens had to grapple with a crossbreed American bull terrier which was totally out of control for upwards of 20 minutes and their only means of destroying the animal was to strangle it with rope.  The two wardens are to be prosecuted for cruelty by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  A dog warden may on occasion have to take pre-emptive action which a dog lover or a member of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals might consider inappropriate.  There is a divergence <Col N="37" /> of views developing between dog wardens and the ISPCA, whose charter is designed to meet a different function. At present, Dublin Corporation are investigating this matter and will report further on it.  One of the features of this unfortunate emergence of divergent views is that legal advice can vary.  When the Minister consulted the various bodies he may have got the views of the ISPCA, but not of the dog wardens whose views are different.  They have had legal advice to the effect that they do not have the power to enter a dwelling under the provisions of the 1986 Act.  However, a warden if accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána may have the right to enter either at the request of or accompanied by a garda.  However a lawyer's interpretation of the 1986 Act is that this power does not extend to wardens themselves.</P>
    <P>If the Minister responds to this point by telling me the law is adequate as it stands because the warden can rely on a garda to enter a particular dwelling, that is a nonsense.  In Dublin we have only three wardens to cover the entire city and two full-time and one part-time warden to cover the county, as the part-time warden also works part-time for Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  One can imagine the amount of work they have to do.  Can you imagine the reception a dog warden will get if he walks into a busy Dublin city Garda station and asks for a garda to accompany him to a particular house in pursuit of a dog.  I do not need to tell you what the sergeant in charge, who is probably trying to deal with far more important problems, would say and I think the warden would be leaving the station without a garda.</P>
    <P>The natural instinct of a dog when pursued is to make for home, but home is out of bounds for the warden.  In effect, what the wardens are saying is that if they are to have real powers of pursuit they should be entitled to enter the home of the animal.  The wardens have obtained independent legal advice and have been told in no uncertain terms that the powers provided under the 1986 Act do not cover entering the dwelling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> If I have not convinced the Minister of the necessity of amending section 11 of the Principal Act I would ask him to bear this point in mind when the Bill is taken in the Seanad.  I will certainly be investigating this matter further.  I would ask the Minister to take this amendment on board.  If he thinks the wording will not take away from what is already in the Bill he should take it on board as it will certainly make the wardens' life easier.</P>

    <P>Subsection (2) of section 15 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, allows local authorities, with the consent of the Minister, to enter into arrangements with any person for the provision and maintenance of dog shelters and for the exercise of the functions of the local authority under the Act in respect of the acceptance, detention, disposal and destruction of stray and unwanted dogs. Subsection (3) provides that a local authority may enter into arrangements with any other local authority or with the ISPCA or with a person connected with animal welfare for the exercise of any or all of their functions under the Act other than those under sections 17 and 30.  The consent of the Minister is required in relation to entering <Col N="39" /> into such an arrangement with a person connected with animal welfare, but not otherwise.  There is no need for the consent of the Minister in these two instances.  The local authority will always be in a better position than the Minister to judge the best approach at local level and the Minister should therefore not be involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about involving local authorities in this legislation as I have no confidence that they will regard its enforcement as a priority. From my experience in my own area there are a great many problems requiring urgent attention which would therefore have a higher priority.  The legislation may sound all right but it will be very difficult to have it implemented throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P>While the Bill is probably necessary, it is very weak in addressing the problem of cruelty to animals.  As Deputy McCartan said, it does not address the problem of dog baiting or the incident when a mutilated dog was discovered in a van driven by barbarians.  I would like to see the emphasis being placed on the people engaged in the nefarious activity of dog baiting.  It is all very nice to introduce legislation in the general sense, but there are aspects of the dog world that demand a measure of involvement by the Minister to ensure that the cruelty that takes place in many areas is stamped out.  Those who engage in dog baiting and dog fighting should be sent to prison rather than putting down the dogs as if the dogs were at fault.  The Minister should focus his attention on dog owners whose dogs get out of control &mdash; this happens if they are ill-treated &mdash; rather than, in a general sense, the hundreds of thousands of inoffensive dogs who give more pleasure to their owners than almost anything.  The Minister should focus his attention on stamping our cruelty.  Cruelty turns dogs savage.  Very often young children can be responsible for hurting a dog and it is very difficult to legislate for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should concentrate on the people who are engaged in extreme <Col N="40" /> acts of cruelty to dogs.  No local authority will rate the implementation of the provisions of this Bill as a priority and there will be no real progress unless the Minister insists that they implement the provisions. Will the Minister address the problem and tell me how highly he rates ill-treatment and cruelty to dogs and whether he intends to stamp out the awful practice of dog baiting here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because my experiences are based in Dublin I will be taking a different approach to this issue than Deputy McGahon.  I would go much further than is provided for in the Bill.  The amendment, <i>per se</i>, is an extremely welcome one &mdash; I say this not as a member of a local authority but as someone who believes in local democracy &mdash; in that it seeks in a Bill to dispense with the need for the Department of the Environment, or the Minister, to give his consent.  This is a red letter day and; it should go down in the annals of local democracy that the Department of the Environment are backing out of something.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say well done to the Minister for the Environment.  I wonder whether he realises the precedent he is creating and how many of us will be screaming at him in a short time asking whether local authorities can build their own roads, build their own houses or provide their own facilities without his Department's consent.  Recently, in my constituency we managed to complete four houses to end a black spot of trouble which had been used by youths to congregate. It took three years to secure the consent of the Department to do that work.  That is the level to which local democracy has been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In principle, it is very welcome to see a Minister for the Environment abandoning some small element of control over local authorities and I congratulate him.  It makes absolute sense and that is the reason he is doing it.  The concept of a Department, or a Minister's office, <Col N="41" /> taking direct control and responsibility for the control of dogs in a local authority area was ludicrous.  Clearly this is the responsibility primarily and exclusively of the local authorities.  They should make their arrangements and their contracts without the necessity of submitting their scheme to the Department of the Environment for examination resulting in a number of officials being engaged for days or weeks investigating it, sending queries, receiving answers and, ultimately, the consent issuing in due course.</P>
    <P>The amendment raises a more fundamental problem from my point of view which I touched on earlier, that is the provision in section 15 that allows for the contracting out of the service.  I believe the warden service should be the direct employ of the local authority.  That is not provided for in the legislation because of the embargo and because of the lack of funds to maintain a proper service. Consequently, local authorities in Dublin, and the majority of other local authorities have contracted out to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  This society are laudable in their own way and I would not wish to take away from the way they operate as a voluntary non-structured organisation that have as their objective the prevention of cruelty of animals generally. However, I consider them singularly unsuited and inappropriate for the provision, maintenance and control of the service dealing with stray and worrisome dogs because there can be a conflict of interest in the work of a warden.  To use a phrase from another context a warden often has to be cruel to be kind and often has to take pre-emptive action to deal with a dog that has gone out of control and is threatening not only other farm animals but people in a public place.</P>
    <P>I illustrated the example of the two wardens who spent up to 20 minutes trying to subdue a 9 st. cross bred American bull terrier in a public park in Dublin recently.  They did not have available to them a stun gun or a hypodermic gun and they had to strangle the animal with the result that now they are in conflict with their employers because this is considered <Col N="42" /> an act of cruelty to an animal.  In fact, a major debate is taking place within the ISPCA as to whether wardens should be allowed use a stun gun or a hypodermic gun in the course of their duties. There are problems from the point of view of the ISPCA in terms of such weapons being made available to their wardens. They have said they were not happy that wardens should have what amounts to an imitation firearm in one context or a particularly dangerous weapon on the other.  They are concerned about the capacity of wardens to use them.  If they are used in a public park to deal with a dangerous animal and the warden misses or the shot goes futher than intended, there may be a risk of injury.  I consider this to be offensive to the wardens who do an excellent job in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The end result of all of this is that the wardens in Dublin are given two implements to deal with animals of all sizes in all circumstances &mdash; a net and a long pole with a loop at the bottom of it. Armed with these two weapons and their hands they have to go into any situation and deal with some of the most incredibly vicious animals, animals that can keep the Garda Síochána at bay and prevent them from entering particular premises. You can imagine a warden attempting to deal with a dog as big as a rottweiler who has lost reason and sense with nothing but a loop at the bottom of a stick.  It is ridiculous in the extreme, but this is what has emerged from the difference between the objectives and duties of a warden and the time honoured objectives and principles of a society whose purpose is to prevent cruelty to animals.</P>
    <P>That is a problem that was never anticipated when the Control of Dogs Bill was being debated in 1986 and section 15 was included to encourage local authorities to employ the ISPCA.  This has happened. However, there are a a small number of local authorities who have not employed the association and who are employing wardens directly.</P>
    <P>The warden service in Dublin, which is the largest in the country, unequivocally want an end to the arrangement with the <Col N="43" /> association and to be employed directly by the local authority.  They are doing a job for the local authority as statutorily required under the Act and they want to be employed under the general purposes department directly by the authority, to whom they would then be answerable.  In turn, councillors and local representatives would have a much more direct involvement in the way the service is managed, run and delivered to the public.</P>
    <P>This is something we can resolve, if not at local level then in the context of legislation.  I concede that the problem is most acute in the Dublin area, although I am bemused to know, for example, how counties as large as County Wexford can manage to implement the provisions of the 1986 Act with one dog warden for the entire county, which contains five large provincial towns and numerous villages.</P>
    <P>There are other problems with regard to the ISPCA.  It plays an extremely laudable and honourable role as a loosely structured voluntary organisation. However, when they were given the duties contracted out under the 1986 Act they found themselves in a scenario that they had not been accustomed to before this.  For the first time they came under the strict provisions of statutory legislation. For the first time they were employing people with a specific function laid down in statute law.  It has not been easy and it is something that needs to be reviewed by the Minister.  Hopefully, it is something that can be resolved at local level by negotiation between the manager, the councillors and the warden service.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Minister has done a sensible and reasonable thing in loosening his hands from the administrative responsibilities of overseeing all of the arrangements made by local authorities. This will give us at local authority level an opportunity to deal directly with the manager and management generally on how the service is developed and maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not help thinking <Col N="44" /> when Deputy McCartan spoke about that nine stone dog that perhaps the person was dealing with a lion and did not know it.  A labrador weighs about 70 pounds and a nine stone dog 126 pounds.  It must have been bigger even that a St. Bernard. It must have had a mane before he came into possession of it.</P>
      <P>I would be against giving stun guns or anything of that nature to dog wardens for the reasons outlined by Deputy McCartan.  There is a possibility that these might be stolen and used in a way that could be very dangerous to ordinary people.  If proper clothing and proper dog catching equipment were made available this would go a long way to solving the problems.</P>
      <P>It is also very important that dog wardens should be well trained.  Perhaps the Minister would consider setting up a small unit of our top people who could be trained abroad and brought back to pass on that knowledge to our own people here.  Obviously, before anyone is allowed out to apprehend dogs that are out of control they would have to be well trained in how to manage such dogs.  Can the Minister tell us if he knows of any country where stun guns are supplied to dog wardens?  I doubt very much if this is so.  If they were distributed I imagine they would be under the control of the police rather than part of the equipment of a dog warden.</P>
      <P>I have no preference in regard to whom employs the dog wardens, whether it be the Department of the Environment or the local authority.  Traffic wardens are employed by the Department of Justice and that seems to work reasonably satisfactorily, although I am sure there are many traffic wardens who might not agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more control that can be given to the local authorities the better.  Those of us on Dublin Corporation, of all political shades, are very much at one in our opinions on the handling of a dog service. There is no question but that there is a particular problem in Dublin.  Because of the increase in vandalism people have got dogs to protect their homes and themselves from physical abuse and we have <Col N="45" /> to contend with the problem when some of these dogs get out of control.  There is the problem of youngsters going around with dogs such as alsatians and these dogs getting out and breeding with other dogs, so that one does not know what kind of dog one is dealing with and whether or not it has a vicious streak.  That is all I wanted to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the other Deputies in welcoming this move by the Minister.  It is good to see him dispense with powers which were preventing the immediate operation of legislation.  In inserting this amendment in response to the points made during the course of the debate in this House &mdash; I do not know whether he has received representations from the parties outside the House &mdash; the Minister is acknowledging the part played by the local authorities and in particular by those who enforce the dog regulations as they stand. I wish to pay tribute to our dog wardens, who operate with a small budget.  In this amendment the Minister is giving the local authorities scope to develop their role.</P>
      <P>While I acknowledge this is a positive move, I have some reservations.  I would like to know if there will be an annual assessment of the activities engaged in and if the Minister will retain control through some section in the Department? I am a bit suspicious; I cannot believe that they are going to divest this power. I have heard the Minister when on this side of the House protest that North Tipperary County Council, of which he was chairman, were having difficulty in obtaining approval from the Department of the Environment for even the smallest of jobs.  I think he knows from his own experience that the local authorities can be trusted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McCartan said, some local authorities may be a bit slack and react to events.  I hope that will not be the case under this legislation.  Since the Minister is granting this power he should consult the local authorities and encourage the people concerned to improve and develop this service.  I have met the dog <Col N="46" /> warden in my constituency in County Clare.  He does his job well.  I would like to acknowledge that the number of serious accidents in my constituency has been reduced dramatically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their support for this amendment.  Indeed, I think we will see more powers being devolved.  While I am a believer in local democracy I would not like anyone to think that the solution from a public representative's point of view will always be to give local authorities new responsibilities. I should say in all honesty to Deputy Carey, who taunts me now and again, that there have been times when it was a great relief for local representatives to be able to place the blame on somebody else.</P>
      <P>In a case which has arisen this week, even though I had devolved authority there is a problem and I am being asked to adjudicate.  It should be borne in mind that new powers and authority go hand in hand with the obligation to make decisions.  Very often these are made in the context of priorities.  In general however the way to proceed in relation to local matters is to grant local representatives new responsibilities and hope that a more dynamic effort will be made through the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The local authorities are responsible for enforcing the dog control legislation. What we are trying to do here is to make it easier for them to do this more efficiently without there being the necessity on all occasions to seek the consent of the Minister.  Deputy McCartan suggested that the dog control services should be run directly by the local authorities. In an ideal world that is the way it would be run, but we are not living in an ideal world.  I should say that we were quite fortunate in 1986 to have a body available to take on this responsibility, the ISPCA, who have played a very distinct role.  It will be open to the local authorities to make a different choice in the future if they deem this to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies McGahon and Carey were anxious to know if there would be a <Col N="47" /> supervisory role and expressed some doubts about where we go from here.  I should tell the House that according to the 1990 report there are 61 wardens throughout the country, both permanent and temporary.  In the same year there were 6,809 on the spot fines, 660 prosecutions and 281 convictions.  The number of dogs seized in 1990 was 15,468, while 11,644 were surrendered and 25,321 destroyed.  In addition, 1,781 dogs were reclaimed or rehomed.  In response to Deputy McGahon, who said that we should concentrate on one aspect only &mdash; the problem of dog fighting &mdash; it is clear from those figures that we are addressing real problems.  In the light of our experience in relation to the provision of new regulations, we will adopt the most flexible and best approach to resolve any problems that may arise.</P>
    <P>It was remiss of me not to deal with Deputy McGahon's question earlier, but in relation to the unnatural and barbaric practice of dog baiting, while this matter is covered by the animal protection legislation which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture and Food, it is clear that the new powers being granted under this Bill will have an effect on this obnoxious, dangerous and unacceptable practice.  First, I will have the new power to ban the importation of certain breeds of dog.  Deputies will be familiar with the fact that in many cases the dogs involved have been imported.  We can therefore make the task of importing dogs for this purpose considerably more difficult by exercising these powers.  This Bill also gives the Minister power to order the destruction or neutering of classes of dogs.  All in all therefore, we will have the power to ban the importation of and order the destruction of dogs used in dog fighting.</P>
    <P>While the other aspects are not covered by this Bill, this is a most objectionable and horrific practice.  The Minister for Justice, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and I will take whatever action is necessary to stamp it out.  In the first instance we will try to make it impossible for people to engage <Col N="48" /> in this practice by either banning the importation or ordering the destruction of dogs.  However, should it continue, the Department of Justice will apply the law rigorously to put an end to this unpalatable and unacceptable practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the question of the responsibility of organisations like the ISPCA which may be used by local authorities in the future.  The devolution of authority to local councils means they will be in the best position, in the light of their own resources and experience, to make these decisions.  I have made it easier and more flexible in that regard.  I know that difficulties can arise from time to time in particular areas between the dog warden service and the ISPCA, but since 1986 a lot of good, solid work has been done.  It is inevitable that differences will emerge, but the dog warden service is essential in putting the provisions of this Bill into effect.  I know they can cause concern, but life is not that simple.  We would love to facilitate all views but it is not possible.  The example given shows where these conflicts can arise, but if something even more horrific happened as a result of the failure of the dog warden service to take action &mdash; however inappropriate that action might seem to some people &mdash; we would be even more concerned.  What were their options in that case?  In given and definite circumstances where action must be taken to safeguard human life one must have regard for them and deal with them in a way which leaves the local authorities in the best position to make long term arrangements in their own areas.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;Section 13 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition in <Col N="49" /> paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of &lsquo;or Garda Síochána&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very simple addition to the 1986 Act.  Section 13 of that Act deals with the power of citizens generally in regard to stray dogs.  It means that they can return the dog to its owner or deliver it to a dog warden.  Because there are so few dog wardens a person who apprehends a stray dog should be able to return it not just to the dog warden but to a member of the Garda Síochána.  It is a very practical suggestion as it means that a garda will transport the dog to the pound, where it will be disposed of.  It is incredible to think that in one year 25,000 dogs are destroyed.  I wonder if people will ever come to their senses in regard to these animals.  It is a remarkable figure.  If a person apprehends a stray dog he or she might spend a long time trying to find a warden in County Clare or anywhere else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carey paid tribute to the dog warden in Clare and I am sure it is well deserved.  However, it is hard to understand how one warden can do the job effectively in such a huge area as County Clare, because the three wardens in Dublin cannot do the job expected of them.  A person finding a stray dog should be able to hand it in at the local Garda barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to the public finding stray dogs.  Under the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, the dog wardens and local authorities have the lead role in relation to seizures, detention, disposal and destruction of stray dogs, including the acceptance of stray or unwanted dogs from members of the public.  In this <Col N="50" /> respect the Garda Síochána may deliver any stray dog seized or detained by them to the local authority in whose functional area the dog was found.  Given these arrangements, it is not proposed to place a further burden on the Garda Síochána. It would be nice to think that we had all the resources which would facilitate Deputy McCartan's amendment, but we must be realistic.  We have had experience of the existing service which does not seem to have presented problems of the order which would require an amendment of this kind.  I am sure Deputy McGahon would say that the Garda should devote 100 per cent of their time to other matters and that they should not be involved in a matter of this kind. Indeed, I support that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  It would not be difficult for the Garda Síochána to cope with this matter if there was a small kennel or box provided at each police station into which a dog could be deposited for the period of time it would take for the warden to come for it.  It is useful to talk about the distances wardens in rural locations must travel.  If a person finds a stray dog in Ennistymon and the dog warden is in Ennis, is the citizen supposed to put the dog in the boot of a car and try to contact the warden somewhere in the county?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin area the situation was brought home to me in a letter from the administrative officer of the community and environment department of the corporation, who have responsibility for the dog warden service.  In writing to the ISPCA he outlined how they would employ the services of the three dog wardens employed to cover the whole city. The letter, which was written in February of this year, included a suggestion that wardens should concentrate on licence follow-up while the third could handle day to day calls.  The legislation clearly recognised that a citizen &mdash; any person other than a dog warden or a member of the Garda Síochána &mdash; who finds or takes possession of a stray dog shall forthwith do one of a number of things, including <Col N="51" /> returning the dog to its owner.  If it is a stray dog it will not have a collar with the name, address and telephone number on it.  The citizen may also deliver the dog to a dog warden.  However, there are only three dog wardens and two will be employed in knocking on doors asking people if they have a dog and, if so, whether they have a licence.  The third thing the citizen can do is to detain the dog and give notice in writing containing a description of the dog, the address of the place at which it was found and the address of the location where it is detained to a member in charge at the nearest Garda station or to a dog warden. When the citizen begins to write a description about the &ldquo;mutt&rdquo; found straying, the description can be delivered to the Garda station.  However, the dog cannot be delivered because the Minister says it would put too great a strain on the resources of the station and the Garda.</P>
    <P>If the legislation is to work this small extension must be made to it.  When a citizen finds a dog straying normally he or she will not also find the owner; it is a straying dog.  Someone who finds such a dog is not about to hold the stray dog with one hand and search for pen and paper with the other hand in order to draw a general description of the animal and then proceed to look for a dog warden or a garda.  Someone who finds a stray dog will try to hand it over to someone, preferably a warden if one can be found.  Another option would be to take the dog to the Cats and Dogs Home here in Dublin, as the warden service is located there.  The clear and realistic option that someone finding a stray animal should have is to hand it in to the local Garda Síochána station.  All that would be required is some kind of corral, and a dog corral does not need to be a massive, sturdy, expensive structure.  A garda would then contact the ISPCA, who run the dog warden service, and that organisation would collect the dog in a van and take it away.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable proposal.  It is particularly reasonable in the context of <Col N="52" /> Dublin, where there is a very worrying development.  In addition to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Aninmals, there exists in Dublin another organisation called the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. There is no link between the two organisations &mdash; they are separate and independent of each other.  However, the main pound used by the ISPCA, and by definition the dog warden services, for the detention of stray dogs is the Dogs and Cats Home in Ringsend.  which is owned by the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  A facility is provided there for anyone who comes along with a stray animal.  Recently the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or their administrative officers, have realised the value of the site of the Cats and Dogs Home for development purposes and now propose to close the home.  They do not propose to replace it.  A major problem would them emerge.</P>
    <P>Of the quoted figure of 25,000 dogs disposed of, I would say that a very substantial proportion was disposed of through the Dublin Dogs and Cats Home.  At present the local authority are trying to find several independent contractors in the kennels business who would be interested in taking on the service provided at the Dogs and Cats Home.  It is certain that none of those contractors, if they were to take on the work, would be located in the city centre. Those in the kennels business tend to be located in the suburbs and some of the satellite towns such a Swords.  There is a major logistical problem developing that any person as contemplated by section 13 who found a stray dog would not be able to put that dog into the boot of a car and quickly shoot down to Dogs and Cats Home in Grand Canal Street.  Someone finding a stray dog would have difficulty in getting out to the suburbs to some of the outlying facilities, if the local authority were able to provide them.  There is no guarantee that Dublin Corporation will be able to find contractors willing to take on that job.  The warden service argue very strongly that Dublin Corporation <Col N="53" /> should provide a central city dog compound themselves as part of their duties under the 1986 legislation.  The Dublin Corporation do not have the resources to do so.  The point I make is that the duty, responsibility and opportunity of the citizen to do something about stray animals will be severely hampered by reason of developments occurring in Dublin in the coming months. That is all the more reason for citizens to have the right of recourse to deposit the animal for a short time at the local Garda Síochána station before collection by the warden service and delivery to whatever outlying location might be found.</P>
    <P>My final point is that the citizen must play a fairly central role in the operation of this legislation if it is to continue to work.  Because there are so few wardens throughout the country it is clear that the dog warden service cannot be the primary apprehender and depositor of the stray dog.  That shortage makes it even more important for the Minister to extend the provision in the practical way I suggest in my amendment.  I know that because the House is on Report Stage the Minister cannot come back to me on that issue.  I should accept a welcome nod of the head, or perhaps a shake of the head, as an indication of the Minister's views &mdash; or perhaps the Chair would allow the Minister to make a very quick response. This issue requires very serious consideration and it is an issue that the Minister may be disposed to carry with him into the Seanad debate for further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain aspects of Deputy McCartan's contribution in relation to the possible disappearance of facilities hitherto available in Dublin for the keeping of stray dogs for a short period of time that merit examination. This is a matter that can be considered. Of course, it is the responsibility of the local authority to provide such facilities but I am certainly of the view, in the context of all of the other obligations faced by local authorities anywhere in the country and particularly in parts of Dublin city, that we should not add <Col N="54" /> another layer to their work.  Between now and the putting of the Bill to the Seanad I should like to further consider some aspects of the Deputy's contribution.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, I wish to ask the Minister whether he is aware of the imminent closure of the Cats and Dogs Home in Dublin, referred to by Deputy Pat McCartan, and the implications that would have for the unfortunate stray dogs.  Does he know about the horrific number of dogs that are put to death? There would be absolute chaos if the Cats and Dogs Home were to close without alternative facilities being provided. Does the Minister not consider it to be part of his function or part of the Government's function to provide an alternative facility and to meet those who run the Cats and Dogs Home in order to determine what can be done to replace that much-needed facility?  There is no city in the world that does not make provision for abandoned animals.  The terrible figures identified by Deputy McCartan illustrate the need for a service here in Dublin.  In all sincerity, I ask the Minister to consider the issue and find a way to alleviate this horrific problem.  I urge him to meet those who run the Cats and Dogs Home in order to determine whether an alternative home might be provided.  The Cats and Dogs Home is obviously located in a very lucrative area and I have no doubt that the recent developments in that region have upped the ante in the financial stakes, but if it is to close an alternative location should be found for the facility, possibly on the outskirts of the city.</P>

Of course, that will be my ambition.  As I have said, responsibility for the implementation of these provisions rests with the local authorities.  But all of us together, wherever the direct responsibility lies, must ensure that facilities of that kind are available in this city on a continuous basis in the future.</P>

      <Col N="56" /> I spoke in the House this morning about the prohibition or banning of a newspaper of world renown and repute, namely, <i>The Guardian</i>.  In passing I should say to the Minister that one cannot treat a newspaper of such renown as one would treat a mad or dangerous dog or a mad breed of dogs.  I hope the Minister will place that viewpoint before the Cabinet when they come to consider this matter.  It is a matter of grave personal concern to me, particularly since that paper has had the reputation of being a true friend of Ireland at different times and taken up unpopular principled stands on many issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that its banning is intolerable and does not make sense.</P>
      <P>I did not become involved in the difference of opinion between Deputies McGahon and McCartan for the reason that both made very good points on this Bill.  Indeed, it is an illustration of the complexity of the provisions of the Bill that both Members could disagree with one another while making very valid points.  They reflected different viewpoints not only in relation to different classes of dogs but also different categories of owners in addition to the different circumstances prevailing in cities and counties and, at times, even the different circumstances obtaining between different sizes of cities themselves. All the points they made were valuable and adequately demonstrate the minefield we must all cross in endeavouring to legislate for all circumstances. That is why I did not become involved because I felt it would be wrong to come down on one or other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally this has been a very good debate.  As you yourself said, Sir, being experienced in terms of handling dogs, I might make the point that we here are all experienced in this respect.  If one is as long in politics as I have been and campaigned in many general elections one will have had many close encounters with various kinds and breeds of dogs, some <Col N="57" /> pleasant and others not so pleasant.  I recall on one occasion having been twice bitten by a dog.  That was in the November 1982 General Election campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister himself, I would not be afraid of any breed of dog.  I am well used to dogs and rather like them.  But that is not the issue here.</P>
      <P>I contend that to some degree the Minister has lost his way in some of the provisions of this Bill.  I appreciate that its drafting was well intentioned and that much work went into it on the part of the Minister and his officials, but they have not tackled some of the nitty gritty issues. For example, the Minister has made no mention of dog fights, the people who organise them or their owners.  These are the people we should be chasing.  I contend that the provisions of the Bill do not go far enough in tackling the activities of those people.</P>
      <P>To contend that all dogs of a certain breed are dangerous and must be controlled lest they attack someone is not a logical response.  One cannot legislate in that fashion because certain types of dogs are perverted and will have been trained for the purposes Deputy McGahon mentioned. To ban them in a general or global fashion does not constitute an adequate way of dealing with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was mention also of the legislative power to require the destruction or sterilisation of dogs in a humane manner under the provisions of section 6 (2) (h). There was no mention at all of the humane killer, the so-called humane <Col N="58" /> killer.  There is the contention on the part of owners of dogs and organisations comprised of dog owners that the so-called humane killer is not at all humane, contending that other methods of termination of dog life should be used &mdash; for example, the use of injections.  That is something the Minister might well examine also.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (2) paragraphs (j), (k) and (l) all deal with the matter of identification of dogs but are too vague and should be tightened up, strengthened and consolidated into one subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the Deputy that he is talking about the Bill in general and not the amendment before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking specifically on section 6 (2) of the Bill.  I could not be more specific.  Perhaps you have lost your way somewhat, Sir.  My amendment requires the insertion, in page 4, between lines 13 and 14, of the following:</P>
      <P>(b) (i)  Destruction shall not apply to a dog which has been tattooed, implanted, or otherwise identified under a national dog identification and registration scheme, unless ordered by a District Court.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Where a tattoo or other means of identification is not visible on a dog, the dog shall be scanned for the presence of a microchip implant.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to this.  I am very clear in what I am saying.  I think the Minister understands that also.  There are two parts to my amendment whereas there are four parts to the Minister's subsection. One of mine deals with the matter of destruction and the other with the means of identification.  Indeed, my amendment deals with both aspects within the one subsection, as does the following amendment, No. 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that the Minister's subsection are too vague.  I would contend that many legislative provisions cannot <Col N="59" /> be implemented because there are not sufficient dog wardens nationwide, so that in many cases we must rely on the goodwill of voluntary bodies to undertake that work.  That is something the Minister should re-examine also.  There is need for a tightening and strengthening of the provisions and structures on the ground to ensure that the legislature provisions can be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Kemmy in requesting consolidation of the legislative provisions.  In particular I support his plea that all dogs of a particular breed should not be condemned.  To so ensure would necessitate the initiation of a national identification code or system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was first published many Members received representations from various bodies.  For example, grave concern was expressed by the Irish Kennel Club about the following list of dogs; American Pit Bull Terrier; Bulldog; Bull Mastiff; Dobermann Pinscher; English Bull Terrier; German Shepherd-Alsation; Japanese Akita; Japanese Tosa; Rhodesian Ridgeback; Rothweiler and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, an extensive list.  There are people who have particular affection for dogs of those breeds.  The Irish Kennel Club sought the inclusion of the provisions of this amendment in the Bill, pointing out that already the Irish Coursing Club operate a registration/ identification system for all greyhounds. As the Minister will be aware, there is the tattoo on the ear which has been in place since 1926.  Therefore, the Irish Coursing Club believed that all such difficulties had been ironed out.  The registration system is totally computerised, all dogs having identification numbers tattooed onto their ears.  For example, technicians are available on demand through Bord na gCon.  Dog owners with litters contact the board and technicians for a minimum charge call to homes directly. The Irish Kennel Club are prepared to act as an agency for any such registration, as proposed by us in these two amendments. If the Minister wishes, this register could cover both pedigree and non-pedigree <Col N="60" /> dogs.  They suggest that some consideration should be given to the setting up of a joint venture with the Irish Coursing Club, given their overall experience in this area to date.  It is important that any agency would set up as a company in their own right, perhaps under the auspices of the Irish Kennel Club.</P>
    <P>The directors estimate a start up pool of approximately 250,000 pedigree dogs and 60,000 greyhounds as an initial registration database.  Tattooing and identification would be undertaken by the agency and carried out by stewards employed by them in appropriate locations throughout the country.  This register could be used as a basis for following up the payment of dog licences. The Irish Kennel Club are correct in making that point.  This system would be of great assistance to dog wardens and make life easier for them.  In addition, they would be properly employed in supervising the system and getting rid of stray dogs and other dogs which cause destruction.  They propose that dog wardens should be responsible for collecting licence fees.  Such a venture would require funding.  However, I believe the Minister would be able to set up such a system.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that the introduction of an identification system here would be in line with current European systems.  It would enable the movement of dogs between countries to be monitored and eliminate the need for multiple identification numbering.  The Minister needs to address this issue urgently, given the requirements of the Single European Act, the elimination of borders post-1992 and the difficulties which will arise in the movement of livestock and dogs.  This point was made at the very end of the Committee Stage debate.  As, unfortunately, we did not have adequate time to deal with it properly at that stage, we did not find out how the Minister proposes to deal with the movement of dogs between countries.  As Deputy McGahon rightly pointed out, we also need to legislate against the use of dogs for cruel sports.  How will the entry of dogs into this country be controlled?  As <Col N="61" /> we will not be able to ban dogs, there is a possibility that dogs which have rabies may be brought into the country.  We need an identification system.  If we do not include a provision in this legislation for such a system, we may have to introduce further legislation in the autumn to cover this matter.</P>
    <P>The Irish Kennel Club believe that an effective control system should be put in place.  Use must be made of the new technology available in setting up such a system.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the setting up of a registration system.  I am very disappointed that he did not put down an amendment to this effect on Report Stage.  I should like him to outline how he proposes to deal with the difficulties I see arising in this area in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments put down by Deputy Carey and Deputy Kemmy.  If we lived in a perfect society I believe it would be possible to have an identification system, but I do not know how it can be implemented in the society in which we live.  Deputy Carey referred to the effective identification system used by the coursing club. Of course, this is a totally different matter &mdash; coursing is a commercial industry which bears no relationship to the conventional keeping of animals as pets.  I am sorry to have to disagree with Deputy Carey on this point.  In the context of cruelty to animals, I ask the Minister to address the barbaric sport of coursing.  I must confess that I supported this sport during my youth.  However, I now believe it is a most barbaric sport which needs to be banned.  Even though it is a very thorny and difficult political issue, I ask the Minister to address it during his term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I believe it would be very difficult to implement an identification system.  I know it is part of the legislation but I do not know how it can be implemented.  Who will implement the system?  Will it be the local authority or the Garda Síochána?  Deputy McCartan suggested earlier that every Garda station should have a dog kennel.  The <Col N="62" /> Garda have to deal with such a high level of crime that they would laugh at such a proposal.  As I said, I do not know how such a system could be implemented.  I should like the Minister to refer to this point in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of Deputy McGahon in calling for the absolutely disgraceful sport of hare coursing to be banned.  Apart from a hyphen and comma here and there, amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are almost identical.  Therefore, it does not matter which one is accepted.  I have listened to the points made by Deputy Kemmy and Deputy Carey and I have nothing to add to what they have said.  I support these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most extraordinary debate I have ever heard on an amendment.  It began with reference to the potential banning of a newspaper and the problems faced by Deputy Kemmy in an election &mdash; he thought a Fianna Fáil nurse might have taken advantage of his vulnerability in 1982.  Reference was also made to the banning of hare coursing, tattooing and a registration scheme for dogs.  I know I am good, but I am not so good that I can deal with all these issues in the context of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of paragraph (i) of both amendments would be that the power to destroy a dog detained in connection with an offence, unless someone undertook to pay for its keep, would not be exercisable in relation to a dog which had been tattooed, implanted or otherwise identified under a national identification and registration scheme, if such were in operation. Such a proposal would hardly be acceptable.  The fact that a dog could be identified would make it easier to establish contact with its owner and to secure an undertaking to pay for its keep.  The objective of this section is to ensure that local authorities will not be out of pocket for keeping a dog and that they will not have to resort to the courts to recover money except in exceptional circumstances. The amendment would negative this and cannot be accepted. <Col N="63" /> Paragraph (ii) of the amendment also lacks clarity and cannot, therefore, be accepted.</P>
    <P>In any event the amendment is unnecessary.  Section 10 (4) of the 1986 Act requires the Garda superintendent or the local authority to give notice in relation to the dog to the owner or other person in charge of the dog seized as a stray if the name of such owner or other person is known to him or can be readily ascertained.  This reference to readily ascertainable identification would obviously include scanning for microchip implantation if such an identification system were in operation in relation to the particular type of dog.  At present the only requirement for microchip implantation is in the case of guard dogs.  It would therefore be unreasonable to require that every dog seized be scanned for such an implant.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon asked about my attitude towards registration and the question of tattooing or electronic identification of dogs.  As I said on Committee Stage, I am extremely anxious that we gradually move down the road of having a proper tattooing or other identification method for the registration of dogs.  I indicated that there are a number of associations or organisations who could help in terms of existing registration and tattooing or other identification marking schemes.  This is a matter that will have to be considered in the context of the regulations which will put this legislation into effect.  We could consider starting with the most dangerous dogs so that the dog warden service, limited as it is in terms of the demands and the resources that are available, could be committed to doing the most essential work first and as the service develops and more people pay their licences there will be a more comprehensive system to deal with the other aspects.  We could thereby gradually improve on and ultimately have a more comprehensive registration system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy referred to the powers of the Minister in relation to the banning and importation of certain breeds of <Col N="64" /> dogs.  I emphasised this matter in answer to Deputy McGahon, who was anxious that we do more to eliminate the very unacceptable and barbaric aspects of dog baiting.  I recognise the point made by Deputy Kemmy in regard to absolute powers for particular breeds of dogs.  It is possible in certain circumstances for some owners to manage certain breeds of dogs in a gentle way and to train them to be acceptable in every way.  My difficulty is that there are special nominated breeds that are bred particularly for baiting and fighting and there is worldwide acceptance with regard to that aspect of these breeds.</P>
    <P>In a more general way, I take the point made by the Deputy.  It will always be the case, just as it is in many other walks of life, that with proper treatment and management and a proper relationship between man or woman and dog, even dogs that are seen internationally as a threat can find a home in certain places. I do not know how we can be so flexible in terms of legislation and regulations as to take account of these matters, but it is important to understand the position and then we can see to what extent we can meet the various considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press my amendment in view of the fact that the Minister has given a commitment that he will work to establish a comprehensive national identification system for dogs.  It is something of which we would approve as long as it is accurate and reliable I hope the Minister has not lost his sense of humour.  The only reason I made a comparison with a newspaper and breeds of dogs was to show how ludicrous the position is.  I did not mean to upset the Minister in any way.</P>

However, I understand how serious this matter is and how important it is to legislate properly for the future and to deal in a caring and compassionate <Col N="65" /> way not only with the problem of ridding the country of vicious dogs but also with the whole problem of stray animals which roam the streets and the countryside.

      <P>While I accept the bona fides of what the Minister has said in his reply, he did not indicate whether in future there would be participation by this country in a Euro-identification system or whether preparations would be made for that.  Section 6 (2) (k) of the Bill makes provision for other means of identification of dogs or of specified classes of dogs and of their ownership.  I appreciate what the Minister said in his reply in that he proposes to introduce a system of identification and to tackle the problem of banned dogs and other dangerous dogs, the activities of which resulted in the necessity for this legislation.</P>
      <P>I am not totally happy that the Minister has reassured the people who asked us to make representations on their behalf, people who own valuable animals whose breeding and commercial potential should be recognised.  That is the reason we put down this amendment.  However, I will take what the Minister has said in good faith.  He introduced some amendments which were put down on Committee Stage.

I have been reading some American legislation and while it is outside our brief we can learn from countries where these problems surfaced.  There is no reason we should not bring our legislation into line with European legislation. It is in order for Deputies on this side of the House to ask how we are faring with regard to European legislation and if we are working towards common European standards.  Other countries with greater populations than us control dogs better than we do.  One does not see dogs roaming the streets of European cities as one does in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other cities.  The Minister can learn from the European and American experience.

      <P>My amendments Nos. 22 and 23 are identical except that the word <Col N="68" />&ldquo;six&rdquo; is in figures in one and numbers in the other.  We are getting down to small print when it comes to that.  This is a minor matter on which I do not want to speak.</P>

      <P>The effect of these amendments would be to allow regulations specifying standards for premises to be made in respect of premises where more than five dogs are kept.  The reference to five dogs has been in the Act since 1986. It was felt then that that was the right point at which to draw the line.  Nothing has happened since to change that view. It is not unreasonable to take the view that a premises with more than five dogs constitutes a kennel and should conform with standards set down for kennels.  Certainly it is in the interests of dogs that their welfare be subject to control where more than five are kept in one place.  For this reason the amendments cannot be accepted.  I know that Deputies can argue about numbers, but it is really a small area of disagreement in terms of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get into an argument as to who is right on numbers.  This was the way it was developed in 1986.  It has not presented any great problems and it should be left alone.  Where we are talking about keeping premises for dogs and making sure they are properly kept, the consensus view up to now has been that we should keep fairly close to the lines that existed since 1986.  That is what we are doing here.  We are not saying that the Deputies are wrong in what they are seeking to achieve.  We are just holding on to the balance that has worked well and has seemed to be a fairly proper one up to now.</P>

      <P>I submitted these amendments in the interests of animal owners associations. One association wrote to me about this. They feel that not all local authorities are so constituted as to be able to devote much of their time, attention and finance to dog control, they feel they have stepped into the breach many times and are in effect doing the work of local authorities in this context.  That should be recognised and acknowledged by the Minister by inserting the words &ldquo;animal welfare organisation&rdquo; into the legislation. Not all animal welfare groups are of the one mind but the Minister should nevertheless acknowledge the contribution of some of these groups who have a good track record.</P>

      <P>I specified that the Control of Dogs Act and the responsibility for the administration of that Act lies with the <Col N="70" /> local authorities but that since 1986 local authorities, because of their resources, have entered into contracts with welfare organisations of the kind to which Deputy Kemmy refers.  A considerable amount of good work has been achieved. There is no great argument between us except that the legal remit resides with the local authority.  It would not be desirable if that was not absolutely clear and there was a variation in terms of who should shoulder that responsibility.  The existing arrangements which allow local authorities to decide how to exercise their functions are the best.  Where the local authority are in a position to discharge these functions through their own resources they have freedom to do so; where the local authority want to contract the function to the ISPCA that facility is available.  There may be other organisations in a position to help and support.</P>
      <P>During the preparation of the Bill and while it was being debated on Second and Committee Stages I met a great number of organisations associated with dog welfare who had an interest in the legislation. That was very helpful in understanding the interest, the care and the concern of a great many people for their dogs.  The organisations representing these people are extremely helpful and educational. They are associated with local authorities in the introduction of by-laws, the allocating in public parks or elsewhere of areas for exercising dogs, and a whole range of activities.  The ultimate control with regard to the exercise of the law resides with the local authority.  They have the right to exercise these functions by working with welfare organisations in the discharge of their responsibility.  The Deputy should feel in those circumstances that we have the best of all worlds.</P>

I would, of course, have recourse to advice in relation to technical matters or specialist areas.  Ministers require support systems and advice on detailed matters of this kind.

      <P>Our amendment is more specific in that if the Minister was seeking the power generally or in specified circumstances in this section it would be more particularly illustrated.  In our amendment we have outlined the circumstances in which the Minister would require powers to regulate dogs as:</P>
      <P>in the event of an outbreak of rabies anywhere in Ireland or make provision for the muzzling of dogs, not being of a breed registered by the Irish Kennel Club on January 1st, 1992, in specified circumstances or in specific cases.</P>
      <P>In particular we are anxious that the Minister would take advantage of this legislation to formalise some of the expert facilities available &mdash; for example, the Irish Kennel Club provide a very good service and have an expert knowledge of dogs.  The Minister has yet to explain why he sought such extensive powers as the words &ldquo;make provision for the muzzling of dogs or of specified classes of dogs either generally or in specified circumstances&rdquo; seem to convey. I ask the Minster to reconsider his position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>These are very important amendments, probably the most important amendments we have discussed this morning, as they deal with the right of the Minster to make regulations.</P>
      <P>We are wasting our time discussing the provisions of this Bill because practically everything in the Bill as drafted is enabling legislation, enabling the Minister to do this, that and the other without coming back to the House for approval or having to consult with various bodies such as the Irish Kennel Club, the campaign against dog muzzling and the other responsible organisations who are concerned about the welfare of dogs but who are only too anxious to protect the public from the menace of unruly, unsafe and dangerous dogs.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department seem to believe that they are the only people of wisdom in this matter.  While they may listen occasionally in a rather gratuitously patronising fashion to the various dog owner organisations, nevertheless they reserve the right to ride roughshod over everybody.  This is the problem with this Bill generally.</P>
      <P>Subsection (d) states:</P>
      <P>make provision for the muzzling of dogs or of specified classes of dogs either generally or in specified circumstances;</P>
      <P>Deputy Kemmy is possibly right in seeking to shorten it and simply make provision for the muzzling of dogs.  With respect to Deputy Kemmy, his amendment is a mere tidying up exercise by saving two lines of the Bill, but it still leaves the Minister with untrammelled powers as there is no general direction as to how the Minister should proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my amendment No. 31 I seek to delete &ldquo;or of specified classes of dogs either generally or in specified circumstances&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;who have displayed certain behavioural characteristics.&rdquo; The idea that certain breeds of dogs can be categorised as dangerous is nonsense and simply does not stand up; also the idea that big dogs are more dangerous than smaller dogs is not true; <Col N="74" /> because we must not forget that a small dog like a little Jack Russell can inflict a very serious bite on a child of three or four years.  In fact, when I was campaigning in the local elections in June last year I was collared by a person who showed me a very severe scar on his face which he said he got from a small dog like a Jack Russell or Pekinese when he was three or four years of age.  It is the behavioural characteristics of dogs that count and I believe there has to be a certain amount of give and take.</P>
    <P>Up to a point dogs and their owners have to be trusted and we have to assume that dog owners are responsible until proven otherwise.  What we are concerned about are those irresponsible dog owners who do not have identity tags on their dogs or who do not license their dogs and who allow their dogs to run around freely.  The Minister specifies certain breeds of dogs, but there are all sorts of mongrel varieties that are cross breeds with 49 other types of dogs.  I do not know how you would define a dog which is a quarter German Shepherd, a quarter Rothweiler and half of something else. The Minister is being far too specific.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 in my name is very similar to amendment No. 30 because I specifically mention the Irish Kennel Club, which is a typical example of a very responsible group of dog owners.  We should write into the Bill a specific commitment from the Minister to try to reach agreement with the Irish Kennel Club.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey makes a very interesting point about the outbreak of rabies anywhere in Ireland.  We should be very concerned about this.  Perhaps this is a point we should consider in the context of the Maastricht Treaty referendum because, as I understand it, under the Treaty powers will be taken away from this country to control the introduction of such diseases as rabies into our country.  This is a very serious matter and is another very good reason for voting against the Maastricht Treaty.  We have been very lucky that we have managed to keep out rabid dogs over the years and it is very important that we continue to do so.</P>
    <Col N="75" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to reject out of hand the allegation that I have been patronising towards dog welfare organisations or that I am trying to ride roughshod over anybody in this legislation.  I ask Deputy Garland to choose his battleground a little more carefully if he wishes to make statements which I believe are totally out of character with the way the debate has evolved from the very beginning.</P>
      <P>Having debated this Bill with my colleagues over the past few months I am extremely confident that we are going to put in place effective legislation and provide regulations that will be very measured and flexible.  They should help us to solve the problem of controlling dangerous dogs and also facilitate those individuals and groups who have taken proper care of man's best friend.</P>
      <P>May I deal first with Deputy Kemmy's amendment where he seeks to delete &ldquo;or of specified classes of dogs either generally or in specified circumstances&rdquo;.  I realise that a Minister has more access to support and advice on drafting and this enables us to put into law something which is worthwhile and effective.  I regret to say that the effect of the Deputy's amendment would require me to muzzle all dogs all the time or no dogs at all.  The effect of stating &ldquo;of specified classes of dogs either generally or in specified circumstances&rdquo; gives us the flexibility to muzzle certain dogs for certain periods of time, but to delete those words would create the totally opposite result from what Deputies are genuinely seeking to achieve.  I find it very difficult to accept an accusation levelled directly at me from Deputy Garland in circumstances where I believe what I am providing is infinitely more flexible and more capable of meeting the need than the proposals before me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to responsibility for rabies control, Deputies will be aware that this comes under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. However, in the event of such an occurrence, and if I were required to do so, it would be open to me under the Bill as it stands to introduce muzzling for all or <Col N="76" /> specified classes of dogs to combat the spread of rabies.  There is not need to specifically provide for that contingency under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Secondly, to confine muzzling to dogs of a breed not registered by the Irish Kennel Club on a specified date does not seem to make much sense unless it is the intention to confine muzzling to mongrel dogs only and pitbull terriers, which are not registered by the Irish Kennel Club.  I could not under any circumstances accept such an approach.  My overall responsibility is to protect the public so far as is practicable from dogs which have the potential to inflict serious injury.  Such dogs would include types of breeds of dogs registered with the Irish Kennel Club.  The majority of mongrel dogs would be made up of strains or crosses of the dog breeds registered with the Irish Kennel Club.  Apart from any other consideration, it would be difficult in the eyes of the public to justify legislating for mongrel but not pedigree dogs when either type can inflict serious injuries.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 from Deputy Garland introduces the concept of behaviour based legislation.  The difficulties with this concept were dealt with at some length in the opening speech on Second Stage.  It is difficult to accept the argument that a dog must be proven to be a public menace before taking action.  Such a concept would have the inevitable result of dog attacks being made before the particular dog could be dealt with &mdash; in other words, the dog would have to bite somebody before he could be muzzled. The first bite principle is an outdated one.  How would you explain to a distraught parent that their child had to be savaged before his or her assailant could be required to wear a muzzle?</P>
    <P>Apart from these points of principle there are a number of drafting defects in amendment No. 31 which make it unacceptable. For example, what does &ldquo;certain behavioural characteristics&rdquo; mean? There is a major problem with amendment No. 32 and indeed with a number of similar amendments which crop up later.  It is well to state the position now in relation to the basic principle.  It is <Col N="77" /> wholly inappropriate that any private organisation or individual would be given the power of veto over any action which the Minister proposes to take in relation to the control of dogs or specified classes of dogs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular body referred to, the Irish Kennel Club is no doubt a very fine and worthy body which performs a useful function.  It must be borne in mind however that it is a body which represents certain dog owners and, as such, would have a vested interest in the issues we are dealing with here. Under no circumstances could any such vested interest group be given special status under the Bill.  This must be stated very firmly and clearly.  This will be the position also in relation to various other amendments which have been put down and which would seek to give special status to the Irish Kennel Club.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting with the Irish Kennel Club shortly after my appointment and I would consider it a very successful meeting. In no way was I patronising to the work they do.  I think Deputies will appreciate we cannot reach a stage where particular interests of that kind, however genuine, however strong their arguments might be in particular cases, can actually have a veto over proposals of this kind. How, for instance, would you argue with somebody who was not a member of the Irish Kennel Club, who was not registered with that organisation and who had a particular dog that the only reason he had a different regime was because he was not registered with the Irish Kennel Club?</P>
    <P>Deputies will realise, in the context of the amendments here, that I have a better solution and one which is infinitely more flexible.  When addressing this question Deputies asked why I was seeking this power.  There was a view that I was seeking too much power.  In effect, what is being granted to me, in terms of the amendments, is considerably more power than I want and considerably more than any Minister would want in helping to solve these problems.  I do not want to be critical of individual Deputies because, as I said at the beginning, in <Col N="78" /> view of the support in my own Department and that of the Attorney General, I have access to advice in terms of the drafting of law which, I know from my own time in Opposition, is infinitely tougher to deal with.  I want to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is: to define the seaward limits of Castletownbere Harbour to include Berehaven Sound within those limits; and thereby enable me by Order under section 2 of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968 to extend the limits of the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre to coincide with the seaward limits of Castletownbere Harbour.</P>
      <P>Berehaven Sound at present forms part of Bantry Bay Harbour and is under the aegis of the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners. Foreign fish factory ships which visit Castletownbere during the mackerel season are unable to berth at the Fishery Harbour Centre because of their size and these ships operate from the Sound.  Because the fish factory ships anchor in Berehaven Sound, harbour dues accrue to Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners who are based 30 miles away by road and two hours by boat.</P>
      <P>There is full agreement locally that dues from fishery related activity in the Sound should accrue to the Fishery Harbour Centre.  It is also desirable from a safety and geographical point of view to have the Sound under the jurisdiction of the Fishery Harbour Centre.</P>
      <P>The Harbour Master at the Fishery Harbour Centre in Castletownbere estimates that he could have collected £65,000 in 1990 and £47,000 last year in respect of harbour dues from fish factory ships anchored in the Sound.  To do this the Fishery Harbour Centre has to be extended to include the Sound.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the Bill contains the following provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  It defines the seaward limits of Castletownbere Harbour.  It provides that Castletownbere Harbour includes the area known locally as Berehaven Sound.  This is the sea area within the limits of a straight line from Fair Head to Shee Head on the western side, and <Col N="81" /> on the eastern, a straight line drawn from Furze Point to Roancarrigmore Lighthouse and thence to Carrigranean Island and thence further to Bear Island.</P>
    <P>(b)  It provides that an Order made by the Minister for the Marine under section 2 of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968 to extend the limits of the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre to incorporate the Sound will not be subject to the procedures outlined in section 2 (6) of the 1968 Act.  This will dispense with the requirement to publish notice of the proposed Order in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or the daily newspapers.</P>
    <P>(c)  It provides that Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners will have no powers, functions or duties in relation to the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre.</P>
    <P>The extent of Castletownbere Harbour was not defined in the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968.  That Act designated a number of Fishery Harbour Centres, including Castletownbere, and provided for their limits of jurisdiction to be defined by ministerial order.  However, in the case of Berehaven Sound legal advice available to me concludes that it is extremely doubtful that the substantial sea area of the Sound forms part of Castletownbere Harbour.  The legal advice also concludes that amending legislation is required to include the Sound within the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House addresses this legal difficulty by including the area known locally as Berehaven Sound within the limits of Castletownbere Harbour.</P>
    <P>Once the Bill has been passed by both Houses I will then be in a position to redefine by order the limits of the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre to include in it the Sound.  This will enable the Harbour Master to collect the harbour dues properly payable in respect of the facilities afforded to the fish factory ships.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of harbour dues on commercial activity in the Sound area.</P>
    <P>I discussed the provisions of the Bill <Col N="82" /> with the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners during the course of my recent visit to Bantry.  The Commissioners drew to my attention the fact that from time to time commercial vessels in Bantry Bay Harbour berth in the Roancarrigmore lighthouse area.  Once the Castletownbere limits are extended such traffic could then become liable to pay harbour dues to two public authorities &mdash; the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre and the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  In order to provide adequately and fairly for this situation I am proposing an amendment to the Bill. My proposed amendment will ensure that a situation such as this does not arise.</P>
    <P>I hope this short Bill will command the support of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, first and foremost I would like to thank our spokesperson on marine matters, Deputy Monica Barnes, for giving me the privilege of leading off in this debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Fishery Harbour Centres (Amendment) Bill, 1992.  Its primary aim is to extend the powers of the Castletownbere Harbour Master over the waters of the Berehaven Sound to coincide with the seaward limits of Castletownbere Harbour.  It was ironic that during all those years since the position of the Castletownbere Harbour Master was established, the holder of the office had no jurisdiction over the waters of the outer harbour, namely, the Berehaven Sound.  Consequently the fish factory ships and other huge vessels that were using the port enjoyed the privilege of not being liable for harbour dues, something that they were obliged to pay in other similar ports throughout the world.  I can assure the House that it is not before time that this free berthing privilege was terminated and the rightful dues collected by the Castletownbere Harbour Master.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to get a commitment from the Minister to the effect that the harbour dues collected by the Harbour Master in Castletownbere under the powers conferred on him today by the <Col N="83" /> passing of this legislation through this House will automatically go towards the development of the Castletownbere port facilities and the removal of dangerous wrecks such as the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> etc. which impede the free movement of vessels entering and departing the inner harbour.</P>
    <P>The Bantry harbour authority has no objection at any time to this extension of the Castletownbere Harbour Master's jurisdiction over the waters of the said Berehaven Sound.  As a Deputy representing the area concerned I welcome this Bill with open arms and I wish to thank the Minister for the Marine for his wisdom and foresight in introducing this long awaited legislation which I have constantly advocated for years on behalf of the people of Castletownbere.</P>
    <P>I would also like to put on record that on numerous occasions I had the opportunity of questioning the former Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, on this very important matter concerning the people of south west Cork and of the Castletownbere Peninsula particularly.  I must say that the then Taoiseach was always inclined to listen to my views on this very important matter.  I have no doubt but that he probably had a word with the Minister here and advocated the necessity of bringing this legislation forward.  I have no doubt that it will be of immense benefit to the fishing fraternity and the fishing industry in Castletownbere.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill becomes law I want the Minister to give a commitment that the money collected will be used to upgrade the fishing port at Castletownbere, to remove the sunken wrecks that I have mentioned previously and to improve the entrance to the harbour, given its importance to the fishing industry, the most important industry in that area.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 1 and Question No. 19 together.</P>
      <P>The internal Department of the Marine report of the preliminary inquiry under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, into the collision of the <i>m.v. Sumburgh Head</i> and <i>m.v. Tipperary</i> was not released as the policy at the time was for such reports to remain confidential to the Minister.  The reasons for the policy of non-disclosure were briefly as follows: the view was taken that if such findings were published witnesses might be less than willing to be frank with the Department of the Marine surveyor especially in cases where victims may have died, due, for example, to carelessness or negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of a marine casualty report by the Department of the Marine was to review safety procedures and to establish quickly the cause of the accident. Very often, however, disclosure of <Col N="85" /> a report was sought as a basis for litigation or as a means of apportioning blame.  The reports were never intended for such use and more appropriate fora exist in which to pursue such issues.  As the casualty reports were compiled without legal representation of interested parties by people without legal training and since those held responsible in a report would have no right of reply, publication could lead to legal problems.  The legal advice was that there was no statutory requirement to publish reports and there were a number of legal precedents which indicated that the disclosure of casualty reports was not required.</P>
    <P>Based on the findings of the internal Department of the Marine report into the <i>m.v. Sumburgh Head</i> and <i>m.v. Tipperary</i> collision in 1988 and following consultations between my Department and the Dublin Port and Docks Board, a number of improvements were made to prevent a recurrence.  These included improvement of training for staff in the port radio station, fitting of a new radar system by the Dublin Port and Docks Board, improved traffic arrangements introduced by the board between buoys 3 and 4, and installation of a recording device to tape radio traffic.  Subsequently, a traffic system for chemical tankers was introduced in July 1991.</P>
    <P>In relation to the more recent collision between the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> and <i>m.v. Hasselwerder</i> in Dublin Bay, I indicated to the House during my contribution on Committee Stage of the Merchant Shipping Bill, 1991, that I hoped, subject to legal considerations, to be in a position to publish a report of the Department of the Marine inquiry into that incident when any legal processes have been completed. I would like to inform the House that the general policy of non-disclosure of marine casualty reports has been critically reviewed and that in future a report of the investigation into marine accidents will be released and made available to the public.  This is being done in an effort to allay public concern, reflected by Deputies on all sides of the House, for greater disclosure in the interest of maritime safety.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> I would like to make it clear that this new policy will apply to the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> and <i>m.v. Hasselswerder</i> collision in November last and to all subsequent marine accident investigations conducted by my Department.  However, as earlier investigations were conducted under different circumstances with certain guarantees of confidentiality being given, the new policy will not have retrospective effect.</P>
    <P>Pending release of the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> and <i>m.v. Hasselwerder</i> report, my Department have written to Dublin Port and Docks Board on a number of occasions directing that certain remedial action be taken.  This would involve strengthening the traffic regulations.  In addition, a number of meetings were held and others are planned to discuss such remedial action with the port officials and it is hoped that progress can be made even in advance of publication of my Department's report.</P>
    <P>The cost of wreck removal of the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> falls to be paid by the insurers of the vessel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that I attach the utmost gravity to this matter.  This accident occurred in November and there is still no information some months later on what exactly happened.  There were two vessels in the one lane.  We were told that this could not happen under the traffic control regulations.  I cannot understand how culpability, responsibility and liability, in terms of the cost of the salvage, has not been apportioned. Will the Minister say who will ultimately pay for the cost of the salvage and take responsibility for the accident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It falls to be paid by the insurers of the vessel, <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i>.  I do not know how this will be apportioned as that is a separate matter.  The collision <Col N="87" /> between the <i>m.v. Hasselwerder</i> and the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> resulted, as Deputies are aware, in the death of three crew members.  Preliminary findings indicated that the matter required further investigation by the Garda Síochána and all papers were sent to the Garda Commissioner. A senior Garda officer was assigned to lead the investigation.  I understand that the Garda file has now been forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge what the Minister has said, but I still feel that there is a conspiracy of silence on this matter. Given that both ships, the <i>m.v. Hasselwerder</i> and the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> were insured, would the Miniser clarify which insurance company is paying the bills as this would give us some idea of who was responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question already.  The cost of wreck removal of the <i>m.v. Kilkenny</i> falls to be paid by the insurers of the vessel.  In relation to what will happen subsequently, this all depends on the outcome of their and of all the other investigations under way.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no conspiracy of silence.  I understand the Garda file in relation to the tragic deaths of the three crew members has been forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Deputy will have to wait the outcome of his consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked Minister for the Marine if he or his Department has had discussions with Spanish fishing vessel owners regarding illegal fishing off our coast; if so, if he will outline the result of these discussions; the action he proposes to take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 1991 at the instigation of industry representatives in the <Col N="88" /> south west a meeting was held with Spanish fishing boat interests.  Officials of my Department attended the meeting as observers.</P>
      <P>At that meeting the difficulties being experienced by fishermen in both countries arising from the illegal activities of unregistered Spanish boats fishing off the south west of Ireland were considered. In an effort to address these problems it was agreed that the Spanish interests would forward a list of boats fishing out of the major parts in northern Spain many of which they suspected to be fishing illegally in Irish waters.  On examination in my Department of the list supplied it was found in fact that practically all the boats listed were licensed to fish in Irish waters.  There have been no formal discussions with Spanish vessel owners regarding illegal fishing off our coasts.</P>
      <P>I think it important to mention here the initiative taken by my predecessor, An Tánaiste, at the Council of Fisheries Ministers in April of last year when he sought positive action at Community level to address this serious problem of illegal fishing off the Irish coast.  In response to this initiative a Community mechanism was put in place under which the five member states concerned and the Commission agreed to co-operate at operational level in monitoring the activities of unauthorised fishing boats.  While this has led to some improvement in the monitoring of illegal operators, there is, in my view, room for further improvement in the systems currently in place.</P>
      <P>At my request my Department, at last week's High Level Fisheries Group meeting in Lisbon, raised the matter of having regular meetings between the fisheries protection inspectorates of member states and the Commission with a view to, <i>inter alia</i>, strengthening and improving existing co-operation in the area of controlling illegal fishing activity.  This suggestion received general support at the meeting and the incoming United Kingdom Presidency agreed to convene such a meeting of representatives of member states' fisheries inspectorates next September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> From my recent visits to fishing ports around the country I am very much aware of the grave concerns of Irish fishermen with regard to illegal fishing off our coast. I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to resolving this problem and I am confident that my most recent initiative will advance the achievement of this objective.</P>
    <P>I would also like to stress that one of the most effective means of combating illegal fishing is through strict enforcement of Community fisheries law at sea. In this regard I wish to acknowledge the valuable work of the Irish Naval Service in protecting fish stocks off our coasts. Last year alone a total of 81 boats was detained by the Navy for suspected fisheries infringements.  The operational effectiveness of our fisheries protection effort at sea will be further enhanced by new equipment and technology now being acquired by the Naval Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very detailed reply and I welcome his initiatives in trying to curb piracy on our waters.  I am sure the Minister will agree that we are again facing a season where there could be confrontation on the waters off our coast. Will the Minister confirm that 38 of the trawlers arrested last year were of Spanish origin?  It appears, in spite of exploring every avenue to try to curb this kind of poaching, it is still prevalent in our waters.  Will the Minister consider confiscating trawlers or &mdash; as I suggested to him on several occasions &mdash; much steeper fines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of fines is being examined at EC level. However, the problem is that our fines tend to be higher and, therefore, we might not want a uniform approach.  I can confirm, from the breakdown of arrests and detentions during 1991, that 36 trawlers were Spanish, nine were UK-Spanish and 48 Irish-Spanish.</P>

      <P>I expect the institute to bring forward proposals for the future scope and direction of marine research at a fairly early stage following establishment. I would point out to the Deputy, however, that current priority areas for marine research and development have been identified and agreed <Col N="92" /> under the marine measures of Ireland's STRIDE operational programme.  A significant level of funding is now being directed into key marine research facilities around the country which will underpin those priorities.</P>
      <P>The objective of the investment programme is to strengthen the national marine research capability in order to develop, but also to conserve and protect, the fisheries and other marine resources.

      <P>Since 18 October 1991, I have made three appointments to State agencies under my aegis.  On 13 November 1991 the Tánaiste and then Minister for the Marine appointed Mr. Thomas Carr to the Wexford Harbour Commissioners whilst on 11 December 1991 he appointed Messrs George Duffy and John McGuinness to the Dundalk Harbour Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Copies of the guidelines for State bodies prepared by the Department of Finance and approved by the Government were forwarded in early April by me to all the State agencies under the aegis of my Department including harbour authorities and I have requested that they be implemented.</P>
      <P>Most harbour authorities regulate, by standing orders, their procedures and business.  The standing orders of the Wexford and Dundalk harbour commissioners require commissioners to disclose financial or material interests where relevant to the board.  Of course, when I refer to &ldquo;me&rdquo; I am referring to the Minister and I was not involved at that stage. As Deputies know, it was when Deputy Wilson was Minister for the Marine that those three appointments were made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 15, 33, 34 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The question of developing transhipment facilities in the Shannon Estuary is being examined at present by my Department, in consultation with An Taoiseach's Department, other Departments and relevant State agencies.</P>
      <P>Initially this examination will consist of an assessment of facilities available in the estuary.  The potential market for transhipped goods, by mode and destination, will also be examined.</P>
      <P>I would expect that it will take some weeks to complete this initial review of the transhipment question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the <Col N="95" /> transhipment element of this issue, could the Minister say what consideration is being given to this proposal? Is it proposed to tranship by smaller vessels into Europe or by carriers across land? Has consideration been given to the provision of Structural Funds for either method of transportation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that this matter arose by way of a major announcement by the Taoiseach in response to a proposal of Dr. Tony O'Ryan concerning an air bridge in which the Taoiseach said he had a proposal for a deep water transhipment facility?  Is the Minister saying that the Taoiseach was speaking off the top of his head and that there is no specific project, that this idea was merely something plucked out of the air?  What is the solid blueprint?  Second, does the Minister consider that a one channel estuary authority would be the best vehicle to oversee this development or does he prefer the existing system, under which there is a multiplicity of port authorities in the Shannon Estuary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as Structural Funds may be available, the question of the organisational arrangement of the area generally would come up.  That is one matter that will have to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of an air bridge versus a sea bridge has been raised.  Of course, several sea bridges to Europe are being considered for access to Europe.  I remind the Deputy that 97 per cent in volume of all our exports go by sea; it is therefore easy to recognise the importance of a sea bridge to Ireland.  The developments taking place internationally, particularly given the changes in the GATT, will result in much increased global trade.  This project is <Col N="96" /> related to the expected increase in global trade.  I assure the Deputy that the concept is being examined thoroughly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister about the examination of facilities to which he referred.  He said the examination would be completed in a matter of weeks.  When did that examination begin?  In view of the Taoiseach's indication that the facility would be capable of accommodating vessels of 300,000 tonnes, has the examination found that the facility will be able to accommodate vessels of that size?  In which of the existing ports in the Shannon Estuary will it be possible to accommodate those vessels, or is it intended to establish a new port?  The Taoiseach referred to the facility being integrated with Shannon Airport and could the Minister give any indication as to whether the development might be some kind of compensatory promise in anticipation of a decision on the Shannon stop-over?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is injecting new matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been under consideration for some time.  The Deputy asked about ships of 300,000 tonnes.  The position is that the maximum size of vessel that can enter Moneypoint is 150,000 tonnes to 170,000 tonnes, drawing 17 to 18 metres of water.  The marine facility at Moneypoint has a depth of 25 metres alongside at low water and is designed for vessels of 250,000 tonnes &mdash; the inner marine facility can accommodate a vessel of 250,000 tonnes.  The development of the deep water navigation channel could allow a vessel of 250,000 tonnes to enter there, for example.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the creation of a new transhipment port, as envisaged in the Taoiseach's announcement, would be a waste of valuable finance in that it would cost millions of pounds and would not be economically viable for the reason that transhipment from the United States to <Col N="97" /> this country or to Europe would be better off going through Rotterdam or through existing ports such as Cork, Waterford or Rosslare on the south coast?  Will the Minister agree it would be ridiculous to create a new port which would cost this country, and the EC millions of pounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in the early stages, the ability to bring in ships of that size could result in substantial indirect savings to the ESB at Moneypoint.  If the navigational channel was further deepened it would be able to accommodate ships of up to 400,000 tonnes.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister familiar with the details of the statement by the Taoiseach in Killarney, in which he promised the development of a Europort similar in capability to that of Rotterdam? In view of that, will the Minister indicate the extent of the studies, particularly in relation to the feasibility study, on the transportation economics of the proposition?  What consultation took place between the Department and shipping companies who could be potential users?</P>

      <P>Finally, I ask the Minister whether he is now having to cobble together a response to a question in the House resulting from an off the cuff remark by the Taoiseach in Killarney, in which he tried to hold out a laurel of compensation to the people of the midwest because of the Government's indecisiveness over the Shannon Airport issue?</P>

Will he agree that in no way is it suitable for the type of distribution centre about which the Taoiseach spoke and that it would be much more realistic to have a feasibility rather than a project study undertaken. In that regard would the Minister not acknowledge that the Taoiseach was talking a load of rubbish?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos.  8 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>Under EC Council Decision 89/631, Community funding of £85 million approximately was made available to member states over the period 1991 to 1995 for the purchase of fisheries surveillance equipment to assist in the monitoring, conservation and protection of fisheries stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had argued strongly for such a measure to help offset the heavy and disproportionate financial and administrative burden borne by us in the protection <Col N="101" /> of fisheries stocks in Community waters off our coasts.</P>
    <P>It is expected that over the period of the programme Community aid to Ireland will be of the order of £18 million. This will contribute to the purchase of fisheries patrol aircraft, sea and land-based transport and communications and data-handling equipment.</P>
    <P>I have recently made a case, in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy review, for a Community conribution towards the current costs of surveillance. The Commission are at present examining this proposal.  I will, of course, keep the House informed of progress.  I can asure the Deputy that I will continue to press, as and when appropriate, for additional moneys to be made available to offset the very considerable cost to Ireland of the fisheries protection service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Can he give the House any indication of the type of vessels needed to monitor the preservation of our fishing stocks?  Also will he say whether that funding will come from the EC also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This work is undertaken on our behalf by the Navy.  In the case of fixed-wing aircraft for fishery surveillance, that is the responsibility of the Department of Defence.  The remainder relates to the Department of the Marine programme involving further purchase of equipment for the improvement of detection and information.  The main problem is that it is very expensive for us in two ways &mdash; first, from the capital point of view, in respect of which the EC have been assisting us, and, second, from the point of view of the current costs, which amount to some £27 million per annum. This is a very expensive and burdensome cost to be met each year.  We are seeking some assistance to meet those costs while emphasising that these are our waters and it is our right to patrol them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether in his discussions with the EC, under whatever heading, he has found <Col N="102" /> there is a full appreciation of the enormous, almost impossible, job Ireland has to monitor and maintain proper surveillance of the fishery stocks off our coasts?  In addition, would he say whether he will continue to make it clear to the Commission that our take is so small that it deserves consideration?  Would he agree that, rather than giving us more money to help us protect fishing stocks for other nations, perhaps we should be allowed take more of our own fish, since there are other agreements obtaining with outside countries under which many member states benefit and from which we do not benefit at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I would agree with the Deputy.  Indeed, I felt so strongly about it that we submitted a very strong paper along those lines in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy review.  We pinpointed that the fact we have such a large proportion of EC waters presented us with two problems. One was that within such a large proportion we are allowed catch only a very small proportion of fish and, second, that we have the task of surveillance of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is an extremely difficult task.  Unless it is undertaken thoroughly it will be very difficult to monitor exactly what is taking place, bearing in mind again that our take out of the whole area is very small.  The argument we have been advancing has been that, notwithstanding the fact that this is outside the parameters of the Common Fisheries Policy review, we need quotas for more fish and more ships to catch those quotas.  We are restricted in both undertakings in that, particularly off the north west coast, there are deep sea quotas of white fish we cannot catch because we do not have suitable boats.  I can assure the Deputy that we are taking a very strong line on that.  I believe there is need for a much more comprehensive approach to the whole conservation issue, because if there is not broadly-based conservation involving adequate surveillance the livelihoods of many of <Col N="103" /> the people involved will be placed very much in jeopardy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree we have every right to press for consideration such as that outlined by Deputy Blaney and for extra money in that proportionately we have 14.6 per cent of the total EC seabed &mdash; 14 times our land base and 13 times more than the EC average?  Would the Minister not agree that in attempting to protect and conserve the waters around our coasts we are not doing so merely for ourselves but also on behalf of the European Community generally?  Can the Minister say whether we could co-operate with, say, Canada, which country I know has approached us to express their grave concern about the devastation wreaked by illegal fishing in the North Atlantic, comprising part of our waters?  Could there be closer co-operation and patrolling by fleets other than ours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a separate question on the Canadian issue.  We are doing the work on behalf of the Community but we do not want to lose control of the waters.  That is the other issue. They are our territorial waters and we want to maintain them.  I know it would be very tempting to say these are EC waters and, therefore, the Community should look after then.  As I said, they are our territorial waters and we look after them.  However, because these waters serve the entire Community we should receive very substantial assistance from the Community not only on the capital side, which we have been receiving, but also on the current side, bearing in mind the proviso that these are our waters and we are not going to give away anything more.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Minister neglected in his response to refer to inland fisheries where there are valuable fish stocks.  Would the Minister agree that last year inland fisheries contributed approximately £100 million to the Irish economy and approximately £25 million <Col N="104" /> directly to the Exchequer?  Would he also agree that the management of the fish stocks in that sector is laughable and almost non-existent?  Finally, would he agree that his Department somehow or other forgot to negotiate EC funding for the R&amp;D side of the inland fisheries?  Has the Minister made a decision to rectify this anomaly at this stage?  Has he submitted an application for funding to the EC to support the miserly budget given to inland fisheries?</P>

      <P>I can get the information for the Deputy if he wishes.  I think the figures for tourist related angling was £74 million in 1990 and it is probably more of the order of £90 million for 1991.  I should say that they are different estimates but I would be happy to accept a figure of £100 million.  Much work has to be done in this area.</P>
      <P>I recently asked the fishery boards to put forward specific development plans for the rivers and tributaries in their areas.  I found that people are making representations for the rivers in areas without looking at the entire river system.  It was pointed out to them that the system comprises the river, its lakes and tributaries and if we are going to develop inland fisheries we have to deal with the system as a package.  Regard must also be had to private, public, angling and other interests in the area, the conservation of stocks, etc.  The Moy Fisheries Board submitted a report to me about two weeks ago.  I told them that that was the type of report I wanted but that I wanted it to be quantified.  Hopefully this will be done by the end of the summer so that it can be put into action. If we do not get that type of quantification we cannot even begin to do the sort of things required.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if measures will be taken by the EC to establish a European environment commission which will promote conservation and provide measures at regional and international level to deal with member states which pollute the marine and fishing waters.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any proposal to establish a European environment commission but the EC is actively involved in environmental matters. It recently issued its fifth Community action programme entitled <i>Towards Sustainability</i>&mdash;<i>A European Community Programme of Policy and Action in relation to the Environment and Sustainable Development</i>.  It will become effective with the termination of the fourth action programme at the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fifth programme is more far-reaching than any of the earlier programmes. In the early stages Community policy and action on the environment focused <Col N="106" /> mainly on acute problems within the Community.  Later with the recognition that pollution did not stop at its frontiers it became necessary to intensify regional and international co-operation to combat transboundary pollution.  It is now generally accepted that problems of a global nature are seriously threatening the ecological balance of our planet as a whole. To address these problems the fifth Community action programme takes on board the European Council's 1990 Dublin Declaration on the Environment which stated: &ldquo;The Community must use more effectively its position of moral, economic and political authority to advance international efforts to solve global problems and to promote sustainable development and respect for the global commons.&rdquo;  The new programme also reflects the Community's environment policy objective under the Treaty of European Union to promote measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems. The Community and its member states have a special responsibility in assisting developing countries in their efforts to achieve environmental and sustainable resource development.</P>
    <P>The EC has full status or observer status in a number of international and regional conventions dealing with protection of the marine environment, for example, the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation, the Oslo and Paris Conventions covering the North East Atlantic, the Bonn Convention covering the North Sea, the Barcelona Convention covering the Mediterranean Sea and the Lisbon Agreement covering the North East Atlantic.  Shortly the EC will take on membership of the Helsinki Convention covering the Baltic Sea.  In this way it is in a position to ensure that environmental problems or pollution are not transferred to neighbouring states and that transboundary problems are dealt with on the basis of shared responsibility and co-operation.  Most of the regional agreements contain provisions whereby measures to combat or prevent pollution of the sea must be undertaken <Col N="107" /> in such a way as not to divert the problems to seas outside the area to which an agreement applies.  An EC European Environment Agency which will provide reliable and objective information on the state of the environment for the citizens of Europe is being put in place.</P>
    <P>Next month the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, UNCED, will be held in Rio de Janeiro.  The basic aim of the conference is to elaborate strategies and measures to halt and reverse the effects of environmental degradation and to promote sustainable and environmentally sound development in all countries.  It should, therefore, mark the transition from a model of development almost exclusively aimed at promoting economic growth towards a model wherein environmental protection and rational management of natural resources will be taken on board as integral components of development patterns.</P>
    <P>The Community and its member states are actively participating in UNCED's preparatory process.  Apart from the expected adoption of framework conventions on climate change and bio-diversity, UNCED output will include two key elements: an &ldquo;Earth Charter&rdquo; on Declaration of basic rights and obligations with respect to environment and development and an agenda for action, &ldquo;Agenda 21&rdquo;, which will constitute the agreed work programme of the international community for the period beyond 1992 and into the 21st century. That work programme will include a substantial ocean, enclosed sea and coastal zone dimension.  It is clear that the outcome of UNCED will deeply influence the Community's actions, policies and objectives in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  The policies and objectives outlined by him will be carefully monitored by Members on this side of the House.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that the environment agency that, hopefully, will be set up at European level will have the power not <Col N="108" /> only to carry out reserch but also to take action against a member state who pollutes the waters of another or other member states.  I ask this question particularly in the light of concern by everybody at the discovery of radioactive vegetation on the Cumbrian coast off the Irish Sea where 80 per cent of biomass fish production takes place for Ireland and the UK.  Does the Minister foresee that this agency will be able to take positive action against the UK and Sellafield regarding such pollution which endangers not just humans but also fish?</P>

      <P>The regulation necessary to establish the European Environment Agency was agreed and adopted during the Irish Presidency.  The agency will begin work as soon as the Foreign Ministers of the Community decide where their headquarters will be located.  The purpose of the agency will be to provide the Community and its member states with objective, reliable and comparable information on the state of the environment for the benefit of the public and to improve policy making in relation to environmental protection.  The agency will assess the quality of the environment in member states of the Community, the pressures on the environment and insensitivity in the areas of water quality, the state of soil, fauna and flora, land use, waste management, noise, hazardous chemicals, coast protection and so on. The information gathered will be uniform and comparable and will assist the Community and its member states in developing and implementing EC environment legislation.  The agency will be required to publish a state of the environment report every three years.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to put on record again the long established laws and policy on fishing for salmon.  The first point, and this is fundamental, is that all fishing for salmon outside the 12 mile limit is prohibited under international law.  The second point is that the use of monofilament for salmon netting is illegal.  The third point is that various other forms of netting, gear etc. are allowed for persons licensed to fish by the regional fisheries boards.  It is strictly illegal to fish without being so licensed.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these laws is to conserve stocks and ensure an equitable distribution of the catch.  The downward trend in catches in recent years is causing serious concern.  The whole trend internationally is to phase out drift netting. The pressure from many sources on this country to do likewise is intense.  In this regard my Department are undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the implications of the adoption of such a direction in policy in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> I am fully conscious of the views of some communities around the coast which have traditionally relied on fishing for salmon as a key element in their local economies.  The combination of falling &ldquo;runs&rdquo;, declining prices and increased vigilance over the years by the enforcement agencies has created a particularly difficult situation for those communities. We must be mindful of the needs of such communities and groups and I am anxious to hear their views.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of my visit to Donegal on Monday, 24 February last I met a deputation from one such group, Mná na Mara, who raised the following issues with me: 1.  The regulations governing drift-netting for salmon and in particular the prohibition on monofilament netting. 2.  The adverse effects of increased seal populations on fish stocks and catches.  3. The re-stocking of salmon rivers.  4.  The possible dilution of wild salmon stocks by fish escaping from salmon farms, and reduced demand for wild salmon.</P>
    <P>Following that meeting I arranged for officials of my Department to meet representatives of Mná na Mara and some other interested parties for a detailed discussion of all these issues on Thursday, 23 April 1992, during which a number of proposals were put forward in relation to type of gear, length and depth of gear, length of boat, length of fishing season, length of fishing week, restocking, pollution, seals, fresh-water poaching, penalties on dealers/buyers and buying out licence holders.  These proposals are being actively considered in my Department at present and I hope to be in a position to draw some conclusions in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. As the Minister is probably aware, the group I have mentioned in my question, namely, Mná na Mara, were established immediately after the salmon fishing season of 1991 out of frustration at what had occurred during the season and concern at what the future holds for themselves and their families, particularly those who are dependent on the salmon <Col N="111" /> fishing industry.  Has the Minister given consideration to the proposals of the Salmon Review Group, who presented a report to his Department three or four years ago, making certain recommendations in regard to monofilament nets?  What are the Minister's views on that report and does he intend to make an announcement before the onset of the coming season, which is due to commence in two to three weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a regulation recently, which the Deputy will find in the Library, in relation to the whole question of drift netting.  I accept what the Deputy has said in relation to concern for the future.  This is a very complex problem and one to which we are giving much consideration.  In relation to the specific problems in the area mentioned by the Deputy, the approach we are taking is the best approach.  The problem will not be solved easily; it will best be solved by the involvement of the people concerned to see if we can come up with a balance of measures most suitable to deal with their problem.  As the Deputy knows, there is great pressure internationally in regard to drift netting.  That raises the question of buying out licences, which is one of the matters being considered by this group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. However, the Deputy should look at the regulations in detail.  Essentially they are similar to those of last year, with additional provision for the 26 foot boats, which include currachs, to give them more access to coastal areas, as traditional fishing people are hardly plundering the sea and the stocks.  There is a provision which gives them some further latitude.  It will mean they can go out 100 metres from the promontory or beach.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer and express my appreciation that within days of his appointment he met Mná na Mara and that through his Department he is continuing the dialogue.  The Minister should keep in mind, in his deliberations with his colleagues in Europe, that the whole idea of doing away with drift netting has little to do with the drift netting we are talking about off the coast of Ireland.  We should be very much on our guard to ensure we are not just brought into no drift netting.  Will the Minister give early consideration to the legalising of monofilament nets?  That should have been done years ago.  We are totally out of touch in opposing a more efficient net that can be used in daylight rather than at night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the problem about its use in daylight and that that can lead to considerable danger for fishermen in some circumstances.  That is being considered in this package.  The Deputy can take it that I will keep a balance and that we will not be rushed by a global view of something.  Recently I made provision for the small inshore boats which are not causing a particular problem.  We must wait to see what recommendations come forward and which ones will be helpful in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to be able to inform the Deputy that on the occasion of my recent visit to Ballina I received the report of <Col N="114" /> the Moy Development Group which was set up in my Department last year to examine the options for the future management and development of the Moy Fishery and the Moy system as a whole. The main recommendations in the report in regard to the State-owned fishery in and around Ballina town are that its angling potential should be developed to its maximum potential while the feasibility of operating a commercial eel fishery here should be explored.  The report also recommended that an integrated, comprehensive programme for the management and development of fisheries throughout the entire Moy system should be drawn up and that a planned programme of research should be instituted immediately.  As I indicated on that occasion, I expect to have detailed development proposals from the fisheries boards by the end of the summer.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that a by-law to ban shrimp and prawn fishing on the Moy should be introduced in September in the event that voluntary agreement on regulation of the methods used and numbers of fish taken by commercial rod angling cannot be reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to read in the <i>Western People</i> that the Minister was sampling the splendours of the River Moy during his recent visit to Mayo.  I put it to the Minister that the Moy has been recognised as a huge natural resource, one of the premier salmon fishing rivers in the world, and a major component of any development plan for the region, and that it is being destroyed by the use of shrimps and prawns which are an almost irresistible bait, and by the Moy Fishery Company, a state owned company.  The Minister will recall that his predecessor, Deputy Paddy O'Toole nationalised the waters of the Moy for the State in 1987.  Last year the State fishery company took 13,100 salmon in nets and traps while only 627 salmon were taken by rod.  This is doing irreparable damage to the reputation of the river. This year in the short period so far, 1,000 salmon have been taken in nets and traps while only seven have been taken from <Col N="115" /> the ridge pool which we advertise as a major attraction as a salmon angling pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very difficult to fish in the ridge pool this year because the waters were very strong and unsuitable for fishing.  Leaving that aspect aside, the Deputy will know that the traps were left open during February.  The thing to do is allow more fish up, but the difficulty is that if we extend further, the jobs of the people involved in that operation will be at stake because the income from it will not be adequate to maintain the fishery there.  I want to see a full package for the river.  We must get the people living alongside the river to agree a plan for the whole river.  In that context we can consider changing the existing pattern. We might not get the desired result if we were to make changes now.  The approach we are adopting is the best one. We will look at the river system and, in that context, see where cost-benefit comes in.  Obviously, if a salmon is caught up the river by a visiting angler one could put a value of perhaps £600 on that as against £10 or £12 if it was taken from the traps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that we are sacrificing a bonanza. The ESRI recently did a further study, updating a previous one, showing that a salmon caught on the rod is worth £700 to the area, whereas the total value of the salmon caught in the traps and the nets by our own fishery company last year was a mere £150,000.  We are raping the river and destroying a huge bonanza.  The traps and the nets cannot be removed overnight but it could be done on a phased basis, monitoring the ongoing ability of the river to cater for the salmon coming up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an urgent matter and it is being treated urgently.  The income in total last year was £197,000.  Up to £170,000 was accounted for by the sale of salmon and in addition there was some sale of permits.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Ireland and the other member states of the Community have fishery limits extending to 200 miles from baselines. Within that area member states, including Ireland, have exclusive fishing rights in their own coastal regions extending to six miles from baselines, while within the six to 12 mile zone fishing is reserved for fishermen of the coastal state and the fishermen of member states that have traditional rights in the area, subject of course to quota entitlements.</P>
      <P>I believe that the protection afforded to coastal zones and inshore fishermen within this system is inadequate.  In the current review of the Common Fisheries Policy, I am pressing to have the Irish exclusive coastal zone extended from six miles to 12 miles so that access within that zone would be reserved exclusively for Irish fishermen.  I made a strong case to this effect at the meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers in Luxembourg last month.  An exclusive 12-mile zone would, in my view, ensure more effective control of fishing activities, improve the conservation of stocks and better protect the economic and social position of inshore fishermen and coastal communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should note, however, that achievement of an exclusive 12-mile zone will not be easy.  In this regard I must point out that exclusive zones are a derogation from the general principle of freedom of access which is a central element of the Common Fisheries Policy and that any extension would require a positive decision by the Council of Ministers. It is not open to a member state to take unilateral action on this matter. Nevertheless, there is in my view a strong case for enhanced measures to protect inshore fisheries and the extension of <Col N="117" /> exclusive zones would be a particularly effective means of so doing.</P>

      <P>The Minister will agree that as one of the most peripheral states of the European Community it makes sense to seek the extension of the exclusive zone for one of our most natural and important resources?  What response did he get from his colleagues in the Council of Ministers on 3 April?  Is he optimistic about achieving the 12-mile limit?</P>

      <P>To say the least, I got a fairly frosty response.  I had been at other Council meetings in relation to agriculture, social welfare and health, so I was no stranger to the scene.  The paper we put was fairly vehemently opposed initially by our nearest neighbour and by some other member states; yet when we persisted they agreed later to the inclusion of our paper for examination by the Commission.  Our objective was to get the paper on the record and to have it fully examined by the Commission.  It included this element and the element I mentioned earlier to Deputy Blaney regarding our rights in relation to quotas and boats and also surveillance.</P>
      <P>We made the point very strongly.  It was initially very strongly opposed.  That was early in the day.  Late at night, when it came to the conclusion of the session, our paper was included.  Our objective was to get it on the table for consideration by the Commission so that they would have to look at what is happening here. I was not prepared to accept the existing situation.  I was told the revenue of the Common Fisheries Policy was limited and that it was not to upset any apple tarts.  It is a major review and I would not have been doing my job if I had not insisted on a substantial review.  Ireland is not getting a fair share of the fishery quotas or ships.  I will be going out at the beginning of June and I am prepared to fight hard on this crucial issue.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is essential to get this exclusive zone, taking into consideration the strength of our fishing fleet in comparison <Col N="118" /> with those of other EC countries who have massive trawlers which can literally clean out our rich fishing grounds? Is it not essential to get this exclusive 12-mile zone?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the line I will be taking.  It is almost a statute barred position, but nonetheless I will adopt that line.  If we are to conserve stocks we need to take a different approach to conservation within that area and stop the plundering there.  There are issues here which need a good deal of attention.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This very important Bill relates to fishery development interests in Castletownbere.  The Bill is good news for fishermen in that area.  It is a pity it took so long to convince the Minister and the Government that it is most important to have this legislation passed.  Naturally, good things take time.  However we must give credit to the Minister for introducing this Bill which sets out clearly our aims for Castletownbere Harbour.  The Minister stated that the harbour master estimates that he could have collected quite a substantial amount of revenue in fees from the vessels operating in the sound. It is only right and proper that those factory ships which handle the catches from Scottish and Norwegian boats should now pay a fee because for far too long they had the privilege of free berthage &mdash; in other words free parking in the deep water sound.  Factory ships do not enjoy this privilege in any other port in the world except in Castletownbere. The people of Castletownbere and the harbour were the poorer for the failure to collect the dues from these vessels.  Now that we have set in place a procedure to collect the dues I look forward eagerly to an assurance from the Minister that the moneys will not be hijacked back to Dublin to the Department of the Marine but will be invested in the infrastructural development of the port in Castletownbere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The syncrolift in Castletowbere is incapable of lifting the super-trawlers that operate from the harbour.  I want to see this corrected immediately.  I want the syncrolift brought up to a standard to accommodate the super-trawlers.  It is a sad state of affairs to think that the skippers and crew of the trawlers have to take the vessel up to Killybegs &mdash; a distance <Col N="141" /> of 300 miles of rough coastline &mdash; to have her serviced.  We would like to see the vessels being serviced in Castletownbere and we hope that the moneys collected in harbour dues will contribute substantially to introducing a syncrolift operation in Dinish Island, Castletownbere.  I also hope that we will be able to remove the derelict wreck of the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> which is creating major havoc for the fishing boats operating in and out of the bay.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record the support I received from my constituency colleagues, Deputy J. O'Keeffe and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, in getting this very serious matter introduced today.  They, too, had played their part in getting the Minister to appreciate the serious situation in Castletownbere and the necessity for this legislation.</P>
    <P>I heartily welcome the Bill on behalf of the people of Castletownbere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation which will not be impeded in any way by me or my colleagues in the House. If I were to do so I, an O'Sullivan, could not go back to Castletownbere again.</P>
      <P>This is a very necessary Bill.  It has taken a long time for it to come before us despite Members having put down questions on this matter over the years. It is very important that Castletownbere gets the status it deserves.  I must compliment the Minister on grasping this problem and running with it in the short period he has been in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are delighted that the Bill is being processed through the House.  In the report on fisheries harbours commissioned in the sixties, Castletownbere was assessed as the best fishery port in the country.  Its location, sheltered by Bear and Dinish Islands makes it a very attractive place for ships to berth particularly the big trawlers which, as Deputy Sheehan outlined, have berthed in the sound over a long number of years. Castletownbere has been quite a happy hunting ground for them.  While the people of Castletownbere have probably <Col N="142" /> benefited, the harbour did not benefit but this is being addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill puts Castletownbere on the map as a fisheries harbour, a status it should have had always.  I hope that by collecting the dues from foreign trawlers we will not hunt them away but I do not think that should happen because of the close proximity of the sound to rich fishing grounds.  There is also the tradition of seeking safe berthage in the sound.  I think this will continue.  However Castletownbere will now enjoy the status it rightly deserves.  I believe that we will make strong progress in Castletownbere because that part of west Cork badly needs a shot in the arm.</P>
    <P>While the Bill may be processed through the House in the course of a few minutes it is very important legislation for Castletownbere and we cannot stress enough the importance of the new status it is being given.  I compliment the Minister in introducing this Bill in rapid time and I can assure him of my fully support and co-operation in its speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues from Cork in complimenting the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  I also compliment Deputy Sheehan for his tenacity and the way he co-operated with the former Taoiseach at every opportunity in pressing for this legislation which is very badly needed and long overdue.  The Minister, Deputy Sheehan and Deputy Gerry &ldquo;Castletownbere&rdquo; O'Sullivan have expounded on the legislation and they have done it justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment on an area of the coast a small bit east of Castletownbere, if I may, and I am prompted to avail of this opportunity to do so when I hear rumblings about the setting up of a Euro port in the Shannon Estuary.  This matter was the subject of a Dáil question here today when I learned that reviews have been taking place.  I should like to include another port or harbour.  For the record, in case people are not aware, development in the port of Cork enjoyed probably its most successful year ever in <Col N="143" /> 1991 in terms of total traffic handled, major capital projects undertaken and financial performance.  Total cargo handled topped the 6 million tonne mark with spectacular increases in container and car ferry traffic.  The upward trend in port traffic continued into 1992 and for the period January to March total cargo amounted to 1.74 million tonnes, an increase of 200,000 tonnes, or 13 per cent, on the same period last year.  This is clearly well in excess of current national economic growth and it confirms the port of Cork has an ever increasing market share of national seaborne traffic.</P>
    <P>Cork's reputation for harmonious industrial relations allied to a fast, efficient and flexible service is ensuring that more and more port users are routing their traffic through the port which is so ably administered by the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  Perhaps the port's most striking feature is that it is refreshingly devoid of traditional bureaucracy associated with other large ports.  Instead there is a tangible customer orientation and commercial motivation in line with the harbour commissioner's mission statement part of which reads: &rdquo;to operate, administer, develop and control the port of Cork as an efficient customer orientated commercial enterprise.&rdquo;  Most port users agree that this philosophy permeates the port's operations from functions performed by the port authority to those performed by the shipping agents, the stevedores, customs and all other agencies involved in the port.  Above all, one has a strong sense that the port has a clear vision of where its rightful position is and its future goals.  The commissioners produced a five year corporate plan which clearly charts the port's direction. Cork's commercial outlook is very much in keeping with new harbours legislation which is expected in the next year or two. Besides Dublin, the port of Cork is the only port in the Republic handling all five shipping modes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ní neart go chur le chéile. One of the port's major strengths is the stable industrial relations.  At the beginning of the last decade, in common with many other ports in Ireland, including Castletownbere and overseas, the port of Cork decided to rationalise dock labour and to introduce new work practices in tandem with the introduction of highly mechanised cargo handling equipment which, the Deputy may need in Castletownbere.</P>

      <P>Problems are identified and solutions posed by the harbour commissioners. Port stevedores and port users work towards a common objective of creating a competitive cost effective stevedoring environment.  Negotiations were entered into with the ITGWU, later known as SIPTU &mdash; the Deputy may need them as well &mdash; representing the dock workers.  Broad targets were established and there was general agreement that rationalisation be undertaken on a phased basis.  To date two phases have been negotiated and implemented on a self-financing basis at a cost of over £3.5 million, while it is expected that negotiations on a third phase will commence shortly.  Rationalisation of the harbour <Col N="145" /> commissioners workforce also took place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past decade there has been an investment of over £30 million in new port facilities due to its advanced planning and healthy financial position.  The port of Cork was the first Irish port to benefit from EC Structural Funds.  The port of Ringaskiddy offers the largest multi-user port facility in Ireland.  The Ringaskiddy deep water berth can accommodate fully laden panmac size vessels, 60,000 tonnes dead weight, and a £5 million quay extension currently nearing completion will enable the complex to handle two large carriers simultaneously.  Many thousands of <Col N="146" /> tonnes of dry bulk materials, principally animal feed, are handled here each year and the economies of scale to be gained from large vessels represent a significant reduction in raw material costs for the hard pressed agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>Private sector confidence in Ringaskiddy's facilities is evidenced by their investment in large custom built quayside storage.  Cargoes are discharged ex-ship by the port's modern high output grab cranes which are equipped with dust control hoppers.  In addition to the animal feed shipments other cargoes handled on a regular basis include bananas, fertilisers, cereals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Fertiliser is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent feature has been the increasing number of large vessels carrying Japanese cars and berthing at Cobh and Ringaskiddy.  For these vessels, <i>en route</i> to Europe, there is only a short deviation to call to Cork and the advantage of 24 hour working without tidal restrictions has proved very attractive. Beside the Ringaskiddy deep water terminal there is the ferry terminal, of which the port's car ferry and ro-ro freight services are operated.  Ferry passenger numbers increased by 17 per cent or 207,000 passengers, in 1991 while tourist cars increased by 21 per cent to 53,000 cars.  This impressive growth confirms the attraction of Cork as an entry point for visitors from both the UK and the continent.</P>
      <P>The Cork-Swansea route enjoyed a spectacular season last year and accounted for much growth.  However, there was also a strong performance by Brittany Ferries on the Roscoff route &mdash; the shortest direct crossing between Ireland and France and by Irish Ferries on their Le Havre route.  I would like to see an extension of the services by Brittany Ferries because of its benefit to Cork and the Cork area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Bill and wish it a safe passage through the House.  This is an historic occasion and I commend the Minister for the Marine on introducing this Bill.  I wish to pay tribute to the Deputies who constantly raised this matter, particularly Deputy Sheehan for whom it was a mission in life involving him in many exchanges across this House not just with the present administration but with the former Taoiseach.  I would like to think that Deputy Haughey will now be able to sail into very safe waters around west Cork now that this Bill has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> I can understand why Deputy Sheehan, and others, called so regularly for this Bill.  We have all drawn attention to the physical qualities and attributes of Castletownbere and the need not just to maintain it but to develop it as one of the leading fishing ports in Ireland.  That cannot be accomplished until certain other facilities are provided, including larger ice plants and a lift operation which can deal with larger ships.  The ships that would normally be berthed in Castletownbere have to take long journeys through rocky waters.  The lift system is not alone inadequate to lift ships laden with cargo but even to enable them to be painted.  If we are to build on the progress we have made here today, Deputy Sheehan's request will have to be met.  I hope the Minister will be able to follow through not just by committing the harbour dues which will now be collected but other infrastructural funds to develop the port.  Castletownbere not only has wonderful commercial potential but is also a scenic area of great beauty.  Hopefully this port will be a commercial port of high employment in south west Cork which, as we know, has one of the highest rates of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on Second Stage, said there remains the question of harbour dues on commercial activity in the sound area.  I would like to think that there will be some decision on this.  Hopefully, with the wonderful development and investment in the port, commercial activity will increase with the knock-on effect of ensuring productivity and profitability in that port at a level that it has not reached before.</P>
    <P>Finally, the romantic in me prompts me to ask about the sunken wreck Deputy Sheehan referred to.  I would like to think that the sunken wreck would not alone be raised but that we might find some treasure within it that would put an end to all the worries Deputy Sheehan has in regard to Castletownbere. However, if there is no buried treasure, I hope not just the dues that will be collected but further infrastructural funds will be invested so that Castletownbere will be the leading fishing port in Ireland. <Col N="149" /> In saying that I do not wish to take on Deputy Lyons but healthy competition is never bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank the Deputies for their welcome for the Bill.  They say that every dog has its day.  Even an old sea dog has its historic occasion.  It is certainly Deputy Sheehan's day and I am very happy to be able to give it to him. Deputy O'Sullivan has also pressed me about this matter.  There are always technicalities and various problems but we pressed ahead as fast as we could.</P>
      <P>It is a very important development and I look forward to it taking place.  I would like to thank the Deputies for giving it a quick passage through the House so that it can go to the Seanad, to the President for signature and be put into operation as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan asked where the dues would go.  Since its designation as a fishery harbour centre there has been an investment of £4.6 million in Castletownbere. In 1992 we are providing an additional £100,000 for various development works in the centre.  The additional revenue that will accrue once the limits are extended will ensure that in future the centre will break even, which it has not done for a number of years.  The revenue will be paid into the fishery harbour centre's fund.  The first call on it will be to ensure that the fishery harbour centre breaks even.  After that, the Deputy can be assured we will be very anxious to address the problems and ensure that moneys come back to the area.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Sheehan's concern about the wreck of the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> which sank in 1982 and remains in the approach channel.  The removal would, of course, be very expensive.  However, my Department will pursue various options with a view to its eventual removal.  Obviously, the insurers should be removing it.</P>

      <P>In relation to the volume of traffic, in 1990 a total of 452 vessels entered the sound; 453 entered in 1991 while it is estimated that approximately 600 will enter in 1992.  That would represent a considerable increase.  They also estimate that amost £52,000 in revenue has been lost as a result of this area not being included.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barnes mentioned the ice plant.  In 1990, Bord Iascaigh Mhara provided a state of the art computerised ice plant on Dinish Island which has an ice-making capacity of 80 tonnes per day.  I should say to Deputy Lyons that today we are concentrating on amending the fishery harbour centres legislation.  Cork harbour is a commercial port and operates under different legislation. However, I have noted the Deputy's comments and his vote of confidence in Cork harbour.  Indeed, the harbour is doing very well.  I opened a new container port there recently.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where a vessel anchors or passes through Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre on a voyage in the course of which harbour rates or other charges have been paid or have or will become payable to the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners in relation to the vessel or its passengers or cargo, harbour rates or other charges shall not be payable in respect of the anchoring or passage aforesaid.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to prevent difficulties arising.  This amendment will ensure that Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre will be able to deal with the small volume of commercial traffic which enters the harbour without interfering with a ship which is anchored in deep water in a stretch of the sound over which they have control and which has paid charges to Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to put on the record of the House my complete and absolute abhorrence at the cruel practice of enclosed live hare coursing.  I have no doubt that a majority of Members in all the political parties represented here share that abhorrence and, if given the opportunity, would vote to ban and bring to an end this shameful cruelty.  I trust that, at some stage, my Private Members' Bill will be given time &mdash; perhaps later this year &mdash; to be debated and that, as was the case in the British Parliament earlier in the year, a free vote will be granted to all Members to vote as they choose on this issue which is not one of Government or national policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you know, a Cheann Comhairle, coursing involves the capture of the hare which is, ironically, one of our protected species of animals and one of the most timid.  The captured hares at coursing meetings are let loose in an enclosure and <Col N="153" /> two greyhounds are trained to pursue and terrify the little animal until the hare either escapes through a hatch or is savaged by one or both of the dogs. Indeed, what normally happens is that when one dog sinks its jaws into the hare, which is by then screaming with pain and fear, the second dog arrives and tries to rip the hare from the grip of its rival, resulting in dreadful suffering for the unfortunate hare.  In some instances this has resulted in the limbs of the little animal being ripped off and carried the length of the field by a greyhound while the spectators, adults and children, look on.</P>
    <P>This is live enclosed hare coursing, Irish style, and it is not helping to promote our image abroad, it is having the opposite effect.  It is a great pity that our media do not give this issue the priority it deserves and play their part in exposing it and bringing it to an end.</P>
    <P>If the hare is to have any real chance of escape, it must, at the very least, be fit and healthy.  Presumably, for this reason, there are very specific licence conditions for the capture of hares at coursing meetings. Condition No. 8 states that &ldquo;sick or injured hares shall not be taken under this licence.&rdquo;  Condition No. 9 states that &ldquo;hares which become sick or injured while in captivity may not be coursed&rdquo;. In view of these very clear conditions, what happened at the premier coursing event of the year, the national coursing finals in Clonmel, cannot and must not be swept under the carpet if the Minister is not to be seen to be evading his responsibility.  In all, 37 hares were killed, many in the manner which I have described already, at this Clonmel so-called festival of coursing.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 59 on 28 April 1992 stated:</P>
    <P>A post mortem examination carried out on the hares indicated high levels of worm infestation and coccidiosis. The General Purposes Committee of the Irish Coursing Club concluded that these findings, coupled with the unseasonable weather conditions, were the major factors in the high level of casualties.</P>
    <P>A few weeks later the Irish Cup Meeting <Col N="154" /> at Clounanna had an even higher level of kills but on this occasion we were told that the cause was solely the unseasonable weather conditions.  This was according to the Irish Coursing Club, hardly an independent or objective source.  Other coursing meeting at Castleisland, Thurles and Kilsheelin, according to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 5 May 1992 had high levels of kills attributed to disease in the animals.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, when observers from the Irish Council Against Blood Sports made similar complaints, the chief executive officer of the Irish Coursing Club, Mr. Gerry Desmond, stated: &ldquo;our primary concern is the care, husbandry and standard of the hares generally.&rdquo;  On that occasion the Moate-Tubber coursing club had a three year ban imposed on it arising from unacceptable standards &mdash; only after complaints had been made about the condition of the hares.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the standards at the national coursing finals are the direct responsibility of the Irish Coursing Club but these standards have been shown to be unacceptable by the conditions of the licence by which the hares were brought there.  I ask the Minister to take the only effective steps left available to him, to bring legislation before this House to bring to an end, once and for all, the barbaric cruelty of live hare coursing.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also comment on statements attributed to the secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Food, Michael Dowling, in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 28 April 1992 that the muzzling of coursing dogs is being considered as a compromise solution?  Will the Minister also clarify the statement to the Dáil on 12 May this year, Official Report, Column 1026, of the Minister for Agriculture and Food who said: &ldquo;We are in particular considering with Bord na gCon how coursing can be run in a way which avoids such incidents&rdquo;?</P>

On behalf of the Green Party (Comhaontas Glas) I wish to be associated with the remarks made by Deputy Gregory.  Surely in this day and age every Member of this House must realise that this is a barbaric and unchristian sport, which should be banned immediately?  It is yet another example of the way the regulations &mdash; lenient as they are &mdash; are being clearly subverted.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about this, he should act and ban this so-called sport.</P>

      <P>Coursing is regulated under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, which is under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Food. This Act provides &ldquo;for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing and for the better control of greyhound tracks and coursing grounds&rdquo;.  The Irish Coursing Club operate under the general control and direction of Bord na gCon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sections of the Wildlife Act, 1976, which relate to hare coursing provide as follows: section 23 (7) allows the taking and killing of hares at &ldquo;regulated coursing matches&rdquo; i.e. matches held in accordance with the rules for such matches, which are both published and approved by the Irish Coursing Club, pursuant to the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958. Section 26 (3) enables the Minister to grant licences to coursing clubs affiliated to the Irish Coursing Club to hold regulated coursing matches outside the open season (traditionally in the first week or two of March).  Section 34 (3) (b) allows the capture of hares with approved nets by affiliated coursing clubs.  Licences are issued for that purpose by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Office of Public Works.  In considering applications from the Irish Coursing Club to capture live hares, the National Parks and Wildlife Service must have regard to conservation of the species.  There is no evidence at present that the hare population is under threat or in danger of extinction.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service's concern is conservation of <Col N="156" /> the species.  The perceived cruelty aspect of coursing is not a matter for the National Parks and Wildlife Service but for the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions of the licence is that &ldquo;sick or injured hares shall not be taken under this licence&rdquo;.  Another condition states that &ldquo;hares which become sick or injured whilst in captivity may not be coursed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Clonmel Coursing Meeting, which was held over three days, I understand that the Irish Coursing Club dosed the hares for worm infestation and coccidiosis some time prior to the meeting. There was no visible way of knowing, that the hares were infected by worms or coccidiosis before they were coursed. Only post-mortem analyses would reveal that.</P>
    <P>It is not in the interest of the Irish Coursing Club that sick or unfit hares would be coursed.  In view of the large number of kills, 37 over the three day period, the Irish Coursing Club had postmortems carried out and these showed that some hares were infected by worms and coccidiosis.  I understand that the Irish Coursing Club submitted a report on the meeting to the Minister for Agriculture, at his request.</P>
    <P>Any application from the Irish Coursing Club to capture live hares for the 1992-93 coursing season will, if received, be fully considered.  Any decision by the Legislature to abolish hare coursing should appropriately be made in the context of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 and not the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Consequently, I cannot comment on any statement made by an official of another Department.  I want to assure this House &mdash; and Deputy Gregory in particular &mdash; that as long as I have responsibility I will discharge it to the utmost of my ability and with the utmost care.</P>

      <P>Yes, I shall give one minute of my time to Deputy De Rossa.</P>
      <P>On 1 May 1992 the Taoiseach wrote to the Labour Party Whip concerning the Labour Party Bill seeking to establish the right to travel and the right to information. In the Taoiseach's letter he accepted the general thrust of the Labour Party proposition and specifically gave this undertaking, &ldquo;that the Government will not take any action which would offend against the spirit of the consensus which exists on the issues in question&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Today's action, the effective banning of a newspaper of world renown, is in clear breach of that consensus.  It is important for the House, and for every citizen, to know clearly where the Government stand on this issue.  Are the Government in favour of &mdash; as they constantly say &mdash; and support the right of Irish women to travel freely between EC member states and to have information on services that are legally available in those states, or do they condone the kind of censorship we witnessed today?  The issue is simple and clear: where do the Government stand in relation to those fundamental questions?</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister will say that the matter in question was a voluntary restriction by Easons.  Easons hold a near monopoly on the distribution of newspapers and they are aided and abetted by the Government's failure to clarify their position on the issues of the right to travel and the right to information. The Government's failure in that regard is the clear contributor to the cause of the incredible happening today at Dublin Airport, which must surely make this country look ridiculous in the eyes of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most worrying that this bizarre development shows the ability of one private company in this State to act as <Col N="158" /> the moral censor of the Irish people.  Two or three directors of that company have taken upon themselves the role of censor. We now want to hear the Government's response to the issue.</P>
    <P>There is a sort of assumption on this issue in all the comments made that it is unlawful here at this time to give information regarding services available in other EC member states, including the service of abortion, which has been held to be lawful in other EC countries.  The assumption that it is unlawful is not quite correct and it is a clear over-simplification to say so.</P>
    <P>The European Court in Luxembourg gave a judgment in this regard on 4 October 1991 in the matter of SPUC <i>v</i>.  Stephen Grogan and Others.  That court appears to have held that it is certainly unlawful for students to disseminate information but it clearly made an exclusion in that the ban was because the clinics in question had no involvement in the distribution of the information. Today's case concerned a purported dissemination by the clinics and, under the terms of that European judgment, there is clearly a very strong argument to show that it is perfectly lawful.</P>
    <P>Here we have the case of a private company purporting to act as censor and to ban an activity that may very well be &mdash; and I believe is &mdash; lawful here at this moment.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot escape by saying that Easons were responsible for this.  It is the cloud that the Government have thrown over the affair, their failure to clarify exactly what they propose on the issues of travel and information, that has encouraged Easons and will encourage others to take similar action.  The Government must clarify their position.</P>

    <P>The withholding of 2,000 copies of today's issue of <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper, which contains an advertisement for the Marie Stopes Clinic is the latest ludicrous and ridiculous consequence of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  The newspaper has been treated in that way because it carries an advertisement from the Marie Stopes Clinic, which I should like to quote:</P>
      <P>Naturally, for all this care we have to ask a fee.  Marie Stopes is, after all, a private clinic.</P>
      <P>But we're also a charity so we try to keep our costs as low as possible.  What money we do make goes back into our clinics and into family planning and maternal health projects in over twenty developing countries around the world.</P>
      <P>If you would like to talk to a Marie Stopes counsellor, call one of the numbers below.</P>
      <P>The advertisement then gives telephone numbers for central London, 071.388.4843; for north London, 081.208.0282; and for west London, south London, Reading, Leeds and Manchester.</P>
      <P>I ask how that kind of information could possibly be damaging to either the men or women of this country.  I appeal to the Minister to move without delay to change the law here if that is what is required so that we can be treated as adults and not as children in a kindergarten, where we are protected by individuals &mdash; whether they be private individuals or members of the State, Judiciary or the Garda Síochána.

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise the important matter of the pending industrial action at the CBS primary school, Mullingar, County Westmeath on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday next week 500 pupils at St. Mary's primary school, Mullingar, will be <Col N="161" /> deprived of their education because of industrial action by the INTO.  They have taken this serious decision because of the action of the Department of Education in not recognising certain pupils attending that school.  This is just the beginning of action on the part of teachers which will spread nationwide unless the Minister does something about it now.  He has a chance to act now to prevent a further escalation of this industrial action.</P>
    <P>Children repeat sixth class in primary schools in many schools nationwide for a variety of reasons, principally on the grounds that they may be too young to commence secondary school.  Many children finishing primary school may be 11 years of age who, if they continue straight into second level, would be sitting their leaving certificate at age 16, which is far too young.  Therefore, many of them wish to repeat sixth class in primary school, affording them another year before entering second level.  In addition, parents of pupils may wish them to repeat sixth class because, in some cases, the children may be too immature to commence second level.  We must remember that second level is a tremendous change for pupils, with additional teachers, requiring them to move about from one class to another, taking a totally different set of subjects, when some find it very difficult to adjust.  Accordingly, many pupils leaving primary school are not sufficiently mature, when their parents and teachers may well decide they should repeat sixth class.</P>
    <P>Some children may repeat because they have fallen behind in their education to date.  There are, for example, overcrowded classrooms, a lack of remedial teachers which means many children finish sixth class without having the requisite competence to enter second level, another reason they may decide to repeat.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Department of Education appear to have changed their rules between this year and last year.  For example, at the school in question, Scoil Muire CBS, Mullingar, there were something like 22 pupils repeating sixth class, a number of whom had worked through their own school and a smaller number, approximately ten, <Col N="162" /> who had come into that school from outlying schools to repeat sixth class.  The Department wrote to the school last year stating that only the pupils from outside that school would not be counted for numerical purposes.  However, within the past month or so the Department have contacted the school stipulating that not alone those pupils coming from outside the area but also those from the school itself repeating sixth class would not be counted for numerical purposes.  This is a retrograde step on the part of the Department.  It raises parents' rights to decide where their children should attend school.  Article 42.3.1º of our Constitution stipulates that parents have the right to decide what school their children should attend.  I must now ask the Department: is this right being taken from them?  If parents want their children to attend a particular school to repeat a class does this mean that the Department will now force them to send their children to the school stipulated by them, or indeed to change schools at a time they may stipulate?</P>
    <P>I might point out that comprehensive documentation was prepared in the case of each pupil who repeated sixth class at this school, comprised of a letter from the parents requesting that their child repeat; a letter and report from the school teacher who had taught the child in addition to a letter from the principal of the school involved.  Surely that indicates that these were not rash decisions taken that children should repeat but rather logical ones taken on educational grounds?  It appears to me the Department have decided, on financial grounds only, that children must be rushed through primary school, thereby saving a number of teaching posts nationwide which seems totally irresponsible.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about it before there is strike action nationwide.</P>

      <P>Scoil Mhuire CBS, Mullingar in the past two school years have sought to have pupils repeating sixth standard recognised by the Department for the purposes of appointing an extra teacher.  The position of my <Col N="163" /> Department in relation to this issue is quite clear.  The Department operate a policy of discounting, for staff appointment purposes, pupils who are repeating sixth standard unless those pupils are repeating for exceptional reasons, for example, in the case of a pupil who may have missed a large portion of the school year through illness.</P>
      <P>The Department have emphasised repeatedly to boards of management and principal teachers &mdash; by means of circulars in 1989, 1990 and twice in 1991 &mdash; the need to keep the retention of pupils to a minimum, contending that their retention in sixth standard should take place in exceptional circumstances only.</P>
      <P>Departmental policy on the promotion of pupils in primary schools was set out originally in circulars in 1967 and again in 1989.  The normal procedure should be that a pupil is promoted to a higher standard at the end of each school year. This is to ensure that all children have the opportunity of having three years post-primary education before reaching the minimum school-leaving age.  However, there may be cases where a principal teacher considers that a pupil would benefit educationally by being retained a second year in a class.  In such cases it is felt, by reference to educational principles &mdash; they should be minimal &mdash; that no pupil should be held back for longer than one year throughout his or her national school education period; that usually the retention of a pupil in a class for a second year should take place only in the third or fourth standard.</P>

      <P>An examination of the circumstances by the Department revealed that a number of pupils, 20 in all, were repeating sixth standard at that school, that ten pupils had completed sixth standard while ten others had completed sixth standard in other schools in the area. All of these pupils were expected to be repeating at their parents' request on the basis that some were weak academically while others were considered to be immature.  In line with Departmental policy my Department refused to sanction the appointment of an additional assistant to Scoil Mhuire in the school year 1991-92.</P>
      <P>Another investigation of the enrolment in that school in September, 1991 revealed that there were 15 pupils repeating sixth standard in that year, four of whom had completed sixth standard in that school and 11 others who had transferred into that school to repeat.

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the allegations of over-fishing directed by the Canadian authorities against Community vessels fishing in international waters contiguous to Canada.  This is a very difficult issue, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, and I have already spoken to the House on this matter in reply to a question asked by Deputy Peter Barry, on 7 April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have explained previously to the House, Irish vessels do not participate in this fishery, nor for that matter is this fishery directed at any stock shared by Ireland.  Notwithstanding this, Ireland has endeavoured to play as constructive a role as possible in the Community's handling of this issue, within the Community framework.  I propose to continue to do so, but I would remind the House that the fisheries sector is one in which <Col N="119" /> the Community maintains complete competence, and with regard to NAFO, membership is held by the Community itself, not by individual EC Member States.  It would not be appropriate, in these circumstances, for any individual member state to seek to address NAFO directly on any issue.  I fully appreciate the seriousness of the situation for Canadian Fishermen.  I will continue to voice our concerns in the appropriate fora.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of any system of penalties should be to ensure that the penalty fits the crime and that it acts as a deterrent to would be offenders.  I understand that the range of penalties for fisheries offences provided for at present in Irish legislation is amongst the most severe in the EC Community.</P>
      <P>The question of standardisation of penalties for fisheries offences is being considered at present at Community level. While, in principle, this may be desirable, in practice it may not be practicable in the short term because of the differing constitutional, legal and administrative systems in the various member states of the Community.</P>
      <P>I will be closely monitoring future developments in this matter at Community level to ensure that any proposals for adjustment to the present system of penalties will result in more effective control of all fishing activity within Community waters.</P>

    <P>Irish exports of fish were valued at about £175 million in 1991.  Comparison <Col N="122" /> of the figure for imports with that for exports shows a very healthy balance of trade, of the order of £125 million.</P>

      <P>The fishing vessel <i>Amaryllis</i> which was registered in the UK sank of Mine Head, County Waterford on May 11.  The crew of three took to the vessel's liferaft and were rescued by an Irish fishing vessel in the area.  None of the crew suffered any injuries which required hospital treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the incident a surveyor of the Marine Survey Office of my Department interviewed each of the three crew members.  It was established that when she sank the vessel had been searching for a net which had been lost earlier. The vessel had searched for the net by dragging a scallop dredge along the seabed.  The dredge was attached to a wire rope connected to a winch on board the vessel.  From the statements made by the crew it would appear that the dredge became fouled on the bottom.  The winch which was powered by the vessel's engine was engaged at this point, in an effort to haul in the dredge, and it was hoped, the missing net.  A strain on the wire became noticeable and the stern of the vessel was being dragged downwards.  The crew tried to disengage the clutch on the winch but it seems that this mechanism jammed.  The engine continued to drive the winch and the stern of the vessel was eventually dragged below the surface of the water and the vessel flooded and sank.  The crew had just enough time to <Col N="124" /> get into the liferaft from which they were eventually rescued by the Irish trawler.</P>
    <P>It appears from the available evidence that this accident was as a result of the failure of the clutch mechanism between the engine and the winch.  The engine was not stopped as it was thought to be too dangerous to enter the engine-room with the vessel about to go under.</P>
    <P>The crew of the vessel and the surveyor of my Department are fully satisfied that there was no involvement of any third party or craft (such as a submarine) in this incident.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government remain committed to the continued development of the shellfish industry, and to the development of the aquaculture sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>The shellfish industry is set for continued expansion and has the potential to reach 35,000 tonnes by 1996 with commensurate increases in employment. Output was over 20,000 tonnes in 1991 with employment reaching over one thousand jobs on a whole-time and part-time basis.  The industry offers a significant source of supplementary income for many people in disadvantaged coastal areas.  I was particularly pleased that the recent ESRI Report on the Aquaculture Sector stressed the major contribution made by shellfish culture to economic development and employment in coastal regions.</P>
      <P>Markets are now very buoyant for the key shellfish species, which are mussels, oysters and clams.  This will encourage further sustainable growth in output.  The commercial development of new species such as scallop and abalone is also showing promise and will contribute to overall output over the next few years.</P>
      <P>To maximise the potential of the sector, and bearing in mind existing budgetary constraints, I have directed BIM to give the highest priority to assisting the shellfish industry with financial, technical and market support services. State support for the industry is being complemented by the European Community which last year approved the Irish programme for aquaculture development in the period 1992-1996.</P>

      <P>The biological assessment of salmonid populations, both farmed and wild, is one of the areas of ongoing research by my Department's scientific staff.  Research is also under way here and in Scotland which should lead to a greater understanding of genetic interactions between farmed and wild salmon stocks.  I am pleased to say that this project has been recently awarded significant funding by the EC Commission.</P>
      <P>The effects of escapement of farmed fish continue to be widely debated in international fora.  Developments in thinking are closely followed, and contributed to, by scientists from my Department and other Irish institutions.</P>
      <P>I would stress that the present evidence of the impact of farmed salmon on wild stocks is still somewhat inconclusive.  In line with current thinking as outlined by, notably, the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation my Department takes a precautionary approach by obliging fishfarmers to minimize the risk of escapes through, for example, optimum cage design and net specification.

      <P>The conditions under which Spanish fishing vessels operate in Irish waters are set out in the Iberian Act of Accession. These arrangements which allow a limited number of Spanish registered fishing vessels to fish up to 50 miles off the Irish coast are enforced at sea by the Irish Naval Service.  Monitoring and control on shore of landings into Ireland is carried out by my Departments sea fisheries protection officers.</P>
      <P>I have not been notified of any recent difficulties between Irish and Spanish vessels off the South West Coast in the immediate past.  I understand however that there have been some problems in the past between the two fleets arising from the different fishing techniques practised by them.</P>
      <P>In an effort to avoid any such conflict in the future my Department has recently had discussions with the Spanish Control Authorities.  In the light of these contacts it is hoped that a framework can be put in place to eliminate possible areas of conflict and to allow legal fishing activities to be pursued effectively and safely in these waters.</P>

    <P>An important aim of policy in relation to the fishing industry is to maintain and strengthen its contribution to the national economy and, in particular, its contribution to the generation of employment and growth in coastal communities. A number of programmes are currently in place to this end, including:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the modernisation and restructuring of the fishing fleet;</P>
    <P>&mdash; exploratory fishing, to encourage diversification into new fisheries;</P>
    <P>&mdash; research into areas such as conservation, fisheries management and gear technology;</P>
    <P>&mdash; manpower development, to raise the level of crew skill and overall vessel operating efficiency;</P>
    <P>&mdash; fishery harbour development;</P>
    <P>&mdash; improvement of facilities, including ice plants, at fishing ports and</P>
    <P>&mdash; increased emphasis on quality and hygiene.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some fishermen, wishing to comply with the current 100 per cent capacity replacement policy applicable to sea fishing boat licensing, can experience difficulties in locating the precise tonnage and horsepower needed to facilitate the licensing of a boat.  This has sometimes led to situations where fishermen, who have acquired more than the tonnage required may still face a shortfall in relation to horsepower.</P>

    <P>I am having this problem examined as a matter of urgency to see whether a limited system of trade-offs between tonnage and horsepower could be introduced <Col N="130" /> to relieve the present difficulties, as I am concerned that current policy should not impose unnecessary burdens on fishermen.

      <P>The function of the Garda Síochána at rock concerts and other major public events is to prevent breaches of the peace and to ensure the safety and welfare of those attending such events as well as safeguarding the property of local residents. This includes large-scale sporting and recreation events such as major GAA matches, soccer and rugby internationals, concerts and community festivals. The promoters or organisers of such events are responsible for security inside their respective venues, and they are charged a fee in respect of any gardaí who are on-duty, known as non-public duty, within the venue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the recent concert in Slane, it was a matter for the Garda authorities to decide, in the light of the particular <Col N="133" /> circumstances of the event, what level of policing was necessary in order to ensure the safety and welfare both of those attending the concert and the local residents and their property.  It is clear that as a result of the policing arrangements made that the concert passed off without serious incident and the gardaí are to be complimented for ensuring that this was the case.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for maintaining public order in public places, which includes the vicinity of major public events, is a matter for the Garda Síochána. There are no proposals to change this.  In line with the recommendation of the Hamilton Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control, I do, however, intend to introduce legislation later this year in the proposed Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will include measures relating to (a)  the control of access to public events.

      <P>My Department have made arrangements for United Kingdom social security cheques for Irish residents to be distributed in the same manner as social welfare cheques.  Under these arrangement payments for people in Dublin postal districts 3 to 24 and the rest of the country are being delivered by post. Payments for people in Dublin postal districts 1 and 2 can be collected at a special centre which my Department operates at Oisin House, Pearse Street, Dublin 2.  United Kingdom payments represent the bulk of overseas payments to Irish residents.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with the United States Embassy and An Post similar distribution and collection arrangements have been agreed for US payments and the Embassy is now arranging to have these payments brought to Dublin.</P>
      <P>My Department continue to monitor the situation and will make every effort to accommodate any other groups who might be in a similar situation.  People who usually receive a social security payment through the post from any other country and who are now experiencing difficulties may be entitled to a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  They should attend their local health board office where community welfare officers are available to assist them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the continuation of positive action initiatives being undertaken <Col N="138" /> by Government in respect of the public sector and recognises that a number of companies within the private sector are operating positive action programmes. It also acknowledges that clear guidance has been provided on this matter by ICTU and FIE.</P>
      <P>I have also undertaken, in line with a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, to develop the equality focus award scheme this year in association with the Employment Equality Agency.  This scheme is designed to stimulate companies to adopt personnel policies which include positive action by commending those organisations which have taken exemplary measures.  It is hoped that this will increase the level of awareness among Irish employers of the benefits of positive action programmes.  Additional funding has been provided to the EEA in 1992 to enable it to develop the equality focus scheme.</P>
      <P>I would like to commend the EEA on the recent publication of its &ldquo;Model Equal Opportunities Policy&rdquo;.  This model policy, which has been welcomed by the FIE and by the Irish branch of the Institute for Personnel Management, provides practical guidelines for employers on how to develop effective equal opportunity policies at company level.</P>
      <P>I would urge employers to make greater use of the positive action provision at section 15 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 which permits special training and encouragement for persons of one sex to enable them to take up opportunities for doing work where it can be shown that few or no members of that sex was engaged in that type of work in the previous 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the complementary provision which has been included in the new Protocol on Social Policy as part of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. The purpose of the new Treaty provision is to encourage employers to pursue positive action measures intended to &ldquo;make it easier for women to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for <Col N="139" /> disadvantages in their professional careers&rdquo;.</P>
