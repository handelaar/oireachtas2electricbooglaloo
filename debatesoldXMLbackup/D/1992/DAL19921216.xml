      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 1.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders that: (1) Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 shall be moved together, taken without debate and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair; (2) all stages of No. 12 shall be taken together without debate, and shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; and (3) the proceedings on the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 1 if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 2.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance and the following arrangements shall apply to the Second Stage debate: (i) the opening speeches of the Minister for Finance and of the main Opposition spokespersons nominated by the Fine Gael, Labour, Progressive Democrat and the Democratic Left Parties shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and (iii) the Minister <Col N="246" /> for Finance shall be called upon not later than 2.20 p.m. to make a speech in reply not exceeding ten minutes; (4) on the conclusion of the proceedings on No. 1, statements shall be made on the Edinburgh Summit, to conclude not later than 5.30 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) statements shall be made by the Taoiseach, the main Opposition spokespersons nominated by the Fine Gael, Labour, Progressive Democratic Left Parties and a representative of the Independent Deputies which shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case and (ii) Members can share time; (5) the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m.; and (6) on the conclusion of the statements on the Edinburgh Summit, a resolution will be made regarding the date for the next sitting and the House shall adjourn forthwith.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the proposals dealing with the Financial Resolutions for the Finance (No. 2) Bill are satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 12 agreed? Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 1 agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals agreed for dealing with statements on the Edinburgh Summit?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that the sitting shall not be suspended at 1.30 p.m. today?  Agreed. Is the proposal for arranging the date of the next sitting satisfactory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the House should not at this stage agree to an adjournment without specifying the date to which the House is adjourning in view of the important business before the House.  I would, therefore, suggest an amendment to the resolution, to delete the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; and to include instead the words &ldquo;until Friday or such other date as may be specifically mentioned in such a resolution&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, Sir, that we should not entertain a resolution coming before this House in regard to the adjournment of the important business we have unless the Government is willing and able to specify a precise date to which it is proposing the House should adjourn.  We <Col N="247" /> should not in any circumstances agree to adjourn this House without a specific date being mentioned.  I believe any such attempt would be profoundly unconstitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my intention to let the Whips meet after this morning's session and indeed to agree a date and a time.  If Deputy Bruton is agreeable to that, that is fine.  If he is not agreeable I have no hesitation in saying to the House that the adjournment should be until next Tuesday at 12 noon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should all be practical in our approach to this.  It is quite clear, and Deputy Bruton knows quite well, that a great deal of time is required for talks.  There is no point in being unrealistic and unreasonable by bringing Deputies back to this House on Friday when it is clear at this stage that we will not have business to transact on that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not start yet. It is quite clear that next Tuesday is the appropriate time and I will be putting forward that date and that time before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it, therefore, that the proposal to be put to the Whips will be for a specific date and will not be for any indefinite period of adjournment?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy pressing the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not.  I have a motion under Standing Order 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has communicated with me concerning his desire to invoke Standing Order 30 <Col N="248" /> and I have communicated with the Deputy indicating that in the present circumstances it is not possible to do business of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I understand that the ground for your ruling is that you cannot entertain a motion under Standing Order 30 because the Government is an acting Government and not a Government with full power. The motion I proposed under Standing Order 30 is not one addressed to the Government, it is addressed to you, Sir. Furthermore, Standing Order 30 makes no reference to the status of the Government being a condition as to whether such a motion could be entertained.  There are important matters in this resolution which affect this House, the conduct of a tribunal established by this House and the need for all Deputies to ensure that that tribunal is allowed to complete its work fully.  I believe, Sir, that that is a matter for this House as well as for the acting Government and, therefore, the resolution is addressed to you as the only person who is actually elected by this House so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy pursuing the matter.  I have communicated with him but I should like to tell the House that I regret that matters of this kind under Standing Order 30, or indeed any other Standing Order, cannot be raised at this stage.  Even if the matter were in order the Chair has to be cognisant of the very important constitutional business before the Dáil which remains unresolved and which supersedes the ordinary routine of business of a normal Dáil sitting.  It has to be accepted, therefore, that the rules of procedure allowing matters to be raised with the Government of the day, such as the Standing Order 30 procedure, are circumscribed in view of the present circumstances that the Dáil finds itself in.  In any event let me say that the matter to which Deputy Bruton referred is not in order as it clearly seeks to impinge upon matters which are within the competence of the judicial tribunal which this House set up.  Indeed, these <Col N="249" /> matters are now before the courts.  In effect, the matter referred to is <i>sub judice</i> and I have consistently ruled in this House in recent months that all matters appertaining to the tribunal until its findings are known are deemed by me to be <i>sub judice</i>.  I cannot allow a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I submit that the problem is not solely in the province of the tribunal but rests in the use of privileges conferred by this House on Members of this House.  Therefore this House has a responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy the opportunity of putting his view.  I have pronounced on the matter and I cannot allow any debate on these matters appertaining to the tribunal.  This House, having set up the tribunal, has no right to interfere in its proceedings and we must await its outcome before the matter can be properly debated.  I will have no further reference to the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach why, if his Government supports the motion which was passed by this House and if the Attorney General supports that motion, the counsel for the State yesterday appeared to be arguing for the abandonment of this tribunal which this House established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On a somewhat different point, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like your guidance on the situation where the Government no longer commands a majority in this House, and where the Attorney General appointed by that Government to the general acknowledgment of a majority in this House is either acting on the instructions of the Government or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach planning to introduce emergency legislation or is he proposing to take any steps to deal with the appalling situation of the discharged psychiatric patients on the streets of our cities who, because of homelessness, are going back to closed down wards to die?  Is his only solution to bring in the Army to get the embarrassment off the streets?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When I introduced the No. 1 Finance Bill earlier this year, I announced that a second Bill would be required before year end to complete the legislative provisions needed to be in place by 1 January next.  The Government, at the time the election was called, had been on the point of introducing a Bill containing both measures which it was essential to have enacted by year end, and related provisions.  These legislative proposals were published on 13 November.  If Oireachtas time had permitted, these legislative proposals would have been brought forward before Christmas.  However, because of the very limited Oireachtas time now available, it has been decided to make only those legislative provisions which it is essential should be in force by 1 January, and where retrospective legislation would be unsuitable.  These essential measures are contained in the Bill now before the House and in the ministerial regulations which I have made under the European Communities Act, 1972.  I will explain in a moment why it was decided to adopt the exceptional course of using regulations to give effect to those provisions of the EC Directives not covered by the earlier Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason the bulk of the Bill before us today is devoted to the completion of arrangements for taxation of motor vehicles initiated in the Act.  A small number of minor but essential items drawn from the proposals put forward in November make up the balance of the Bill.  I would like to acknowledge at the outset the co-operation of my colleagues on the benches opposite in facilitating the <Col N="259" /> smooth introduction of this vital piece of financial legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals for legislation to be included in a second Finance Bill contained a number of chapters which provided for the transposition of EC Directives dealing with the structures to apply to excise duties on alcoholic drinks, cigarettes and other tobacco products and hydrocarbon oils.  <i>Inter alia</i>, these directives define the scope of coverage of these goods for duty purposes and set out those that must be relieved of duty.  They also deal with further aspects of the regime governing the control and movement of the excise duties in the internal market, including rules for controlling the sales of duty-free goods to intra-Community travellers; such sales will be permitted to continue until mid-1999. The main framework of this regime is already in place in the Finance Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>Failure to transpose these measures into national law could mean that, from 1 January 1993, we would be in breach of Community obligations and could give rise to operational difficulties for the Revenue Commissioners.  However, given the limited amount of time available for the Oireachtas to process the Finance (No. 2) Bill, it was considered desirable to limit the contents of the Bill to those items for which provision must be made before the end of this year and for which primary legislation is essential. Under the European Communities Act, 1972, it is permissible to transpose into national law the Community directives relating to the completion of the internal market by means of regulations. Although the normal practice has been to effect the transposition of important EC measures by way of primary legislation, the time constraints now operating indicated that the regulatory approach should be considered in this instance in order to fulfil our Community obligations.  In the light of the exceptional circumstances outlined, and the essentially technical nature of these indirect tax provisions &mdash; which will, in the main, <Col N="260" /> have little practical significance on the ground &mdash; I decided to avail of this option rather than include these items in the Bill. These regulations have been circulated to the Members of the House and are also available in the Library.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill I would briefly like to review the past year and look at the prospects for 1993.  In the budget presented last January, the Exchequer borrowing requirement was projected at £590 million, or 2.4 per cent of GNP.  As we are all only too well aware, there has been strong upward pressure on noncapital supply spending this year, particularly on social spending.  Despite the corrective action taken by the Government in July following a mid-year review of the likely outturn, it is quite clear that supply spending will be well ahead of target.</P>
    <P>At the same time, tax revenue should produce a surplus this year, due mainly to a strong corporation tax performance. There are also likely to be savings on Central Fund services.  Taken together, these factors will mitigate the effect on the budget of the supply spending overrun. The eventual 1992 outturn should, overall, represent a creditable budgetary performance in what has been a very difficult year.  In particular, we can take a good deal of satisfaction in the fact that Irish fiscal performance in 1992 should again fall within the 3 per cent general Government deficit-GDP ratio specfied as one of the primary budgetary convergence criteria in the draft European Monetary Union Treaty.  Steady downward pressure is thus being maintained on the Debt-GDP ratio, the other criterion of convergence.  This has fallen from almost 117 per cent in 1987 to 94 per cent last year, and will again decline in 1992.  We should not underrate these achievements, which compare very favourably with the likely budgetary performance in other EC member states.</P>
    <P>The 1993 outlook presents a difficult challenge.  In the absence of a dramatic improvement in the international economy, the budget arithmetic will have to accommodate a further increase in unemployment. <Col N="261" /> Moreover it will have to be framed against the background of limited tax revenue buoyancy &mdash; in part a reflection of the otherwise welcome low inflation prospect.  In addition, there are a number of particular factors which have negative repercussions on the revenue outlook for 1993.  The inauguration of the Single European Market will involve the elimination of VAT at point of entry in relation to intra-EC trade.  This will have an unavoidable adverse impact on cash-flow in the VAT area.  Proposals for alternative measures to improve VAT cash-flow were published in November, but it is not essential to make legislative provision now in that regard, since this matter can be addressed in the budget. Even with measures on these lines, and taking account of the provisions of the Finance Act designed to strengthen the VAT system in preparation for the new challenges it faces, it will be difficult to maintain receipts in this area at the level that would have arisen under the former arrangements.  As the House will be aware, capital liberalisation has required the modification of the deposit interest retention tax (DIRT), and significant losses, both definitive and of a cash-flow nature, will accrue from these necessary adjustments.</P>
    <P>The key consideration in formulating an EBR target for 1993 will, of course, be to ensure that Ireland continues to act in a way compatible with the budgetary convergence criteria envisaged in the draft European Monetary Union Treaty. Nor should we lose sight of the fact that even if we did not have to take into account the EC parameters, preservation of the domestic and international confidence in economic management, which is crucial to sustainable growth in employment, would point to a similar requirement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 makes a few minor, but necessary, technical amendments to the DIRT legislation.  These changes are essential to ensure the new DIRT provisions introduced in the Finance Act operate as originally planned.  First, the section ensures that companies opening foreign currency accounts which are <Col N="262" /> DIRT-free can only do so on the same basis as for DIRT-free Irish currency accounts.  In particular, this means that the company will have to supply their tax reference number in their declaration to the bank when they are opening the accounts.  Allowing companies hold DIRT-free accounts involves a once-off cash flow loss, and not an ongoing cost to the Exchequer.  Companies will of course, continue to pay corporation tax at 40 per cent on their interest income.</P>
    <P>Section 3 also contains two provisions designed to ensure the operation of the new 10 per cent accounts is not more liberal than originally envisaged.  First, the section prohibits the linking of the special savings account with any other account.  This is to avoid a situation whereby a customer of a bank or building society might open both a special savings account and another account, and arrange to have all or most of the interest paid on the special savings account to avail of the low tax rate on that interest. For example, a deposit-taking institution could offer 20 per cent interest on a £50,000 special savings account provided that another £50,000 was left in an account which paid no interest.  This section will prohibits such practices.  The section also prohibits the holding of special savings accounts in foreign currencies. These measures are to fulfil the aim of the special savings accounts &mdash; namely to keep money in the country, while securing for the Exchequer, the best tax yield commensurate with the key requirement.</P>
    <P>We have come a very long way since 1987 when the International Financial Services Centre was no more than an idea.  Now some 220 projects have been approved to operate from there.  These projects have committed themselves to the creation of over 3,000 new jobs and have also contributed substantial employment in the accounting, legal and general services sectors in the Dublin area.  Already some 1,200 of the 3,000 new jobs committed have been filled and the Exchequer is receiving the additional bonus of sizeable payments of corporation tax on foot of the profits earned <Col N="263" /> from the international financial activities of IFSC companies.  In 1992 the estimated corporation tax yield from IFSC companies is approximately £75 million which is a very significant and welcome contribution in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind but that the centre has been a tremendous success and I look forward to it continuing to grow and contribute to employment creation and economic development in Ireland.</P>
    <P>From time to time we need to amend, update or extend legislation to facilitate the development of the centre.  We have done so many times over the last five to six years.  Today I recommend to the House new provisions designed to ensure that certain companies in the centre can continue to trade there and contribute to its development.  In certain circumstances, the giving of tax relief to a company could result in an increase in the overall tax burden, including foreign tax, on the company or its parent such that the company would be unable to continue to trade in the State.  To deal with such situations, it is proposed that the Minister for Finance may in certain circumstances, by notice in writing, reduce the tax relief to which certain companies trading in the IFSC would be entitled.  It is also proposed to cover financial service companies in the Shannon Free Airport Zone which find themselves in similar difficulties.  The aim in reducing the tax relief would be to ensure that such companies would be able to continue to trade here and contribute to the development of the IFSC and Shannon zone.  In keeping with that objective, it is provided that the Minister may only reduce the relief to the extent that it is necessary to secure a company's continued presence in the State.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation is not specific to any particular country.  It would be my intention, however, to use this provision in the immediate future to impose a higher effective rate of tax on certain investment companies in the IFSC which could not otherwise carry on their business in the centre for the reasons I have <Col N="264" /> given.  The legislation is flexible enough, nevertheless, to be used in other similar situations where it is necessary.  The EC Commission was given details of the way we propose to deal with this problem and it has confirmed that it has no objection since a reduction of an existing relief is involved.</P>
    <P>This is an important piece of legislation to help the development of the centre. It is needed urgently, as otherwise the future of certain companies in the IFSC could be adversely affected.  Accordingly, I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with customs and excise measures, arising from the completion of the Single Internal Market, which must be put in place before 1 January 1993.  Chapters I and II provide for the balance of the legislation necessary to establish the revised arrangements for the taxation of motor vehicles from that date.  The current border controlled excise duty on motor vehicles is being replaced by a vehicle registration tax &mdash; which we discussed here at length last May &mdash; to be administered by the Revenue Commissioners, while road tax will continue to be the responsibility of the local authorities under the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The basic framework for the introduction of a vehicle registration tax was included in the Finance Act, 1992.  Part II, Chapter 1, of the current Bill, comprising sections 4 to 17, completes the legislative provisions necessary for the introduction of the tax and includes measures which reflect detailed discussions with trade interests.  The purpose of the chapter is: (i) to specify the rates of VRT to apply to the various categories of vehicles; (ii) to elaborate, clarify and refine a number of definitional and control aspects; (iii) to repeal the existing excise duty provisions; (iv) to provide for a system of temporary registrations; (v) to provide for a system of pre-booking of particular registration numbers; (vi) to provide a system for partial VRT refunds in respect of cars bought by car hire firms, leasing companies and driving schools so as to compensate  <Col N="265" /> them for a reduction in VAT deductibility that arises as a consequence of the revised vehicle taxation arrangements and (vii) to provide for a role for the Revenue Commissioners in relation to road tax enforcement.</P>
    <P>I propose now to deal in some detail with the rates issue.  In previous statements I have made it clear that the priority for the new tax is that Exchequer revenue from motor vehicles be maintained at the level arising under current arrangements.  I also indicated that, in so far as is possible within the constraints of maintaining overall revenue, the aim would also be to leave the price of new cars broadly unchanged.</P>
    <P>At the moment, VAT is payable on the price of the vehicle inclusive of excise duty.  However, because the new tax will be excluded from the VAT base, the VAT payable will be lower.  In order to recover the VAT on the excise element which would otherwise be lost, the nominal VRT rate will have to be higher than the nominal excise rate being replaced. A straight conversion of the excise rate of 20 per cent which applies for most private cars, those under 2012 cc, would imply a VRT rate of 24.2 per cent &mdash; that is the equivalent of the current excise charge plus VAT at 21 per cent thereon.</P>
    <P>However, the issue is further complicated because, under Community arrangements, rates have to be set by reference to &ldquo;Open Market Selling Price&rdquo; (OMSP), as opposed to the &ldquo;Recommended Retail Selling Price&rdquo; (RRSP) applicable under the current system.  While the RRSP is the benchmark for existing excise rates, cars are usually sold for less than the RRSP reflecting the discounts traditionally offered by dealers which, I understand, average about 8 per cent.  The motor distributors, by opting to declare an RRSP sufficiently high to allow scope for discounting, leave themselves liable to &ldquo;additional&rdquo; duty on the amount of the discount built into the RRSP.  Although distributors have always been free to declare RRSPs which are closer to the actual selling price and thereby mitigate part of the tax charge, they have almost <Col N="266" /> invariably chosen not to do so; this is presumably because they considered the higher tax charge incurred as being outweighed by the advantage of being able to offer a higher nominal discount to customers.</P>
    <P>Under the new system, the VRT charge on an individual car will be determined by the application of the VRT rates set out in this Bill to the OMSP as declared by the distributor.  Should all the distributors have declared OMSPs identical to their existing RRSPs, a simple conversion of the old excise rate &mdash; 20 per cent to 24.2 per cent &mdash; would have met the objective of maintaining revenue while leaving prices unaffected. Equally, should declared OMSPs have reflected a uniform level of discount on RRSPs, the same result could have been achieved by an appropriately higher VRT rate; for instance, if OMSPs were all declared at 92 per cent of RRSP, the VRT rate would be 26.3 per cent. However, the evidence to date indicates that distributors propose to adopt different practices in terms of discounting of existing RRSPs.</P>
    <P>This gives rise to difficulty in that it creates a clear and unavoidable conflict between the objective of maintaining overall revenue and the desire not to disturb prices, particularly in terms of the relativity of different marques.  The VRT rate that would maintain revenue from the section of the market where OMSPs were set at RRSP would be too low to maintain the tax yield from the rest of the market where RRSPs were discounted. Conversely, the rate that would be needed to maintain revenue in the section of the market where RRSPs were discounted would result in an increased tax charge on the remainder, with consequently higher prices.</P>
    <P>Faced with this division, as already stated, it is simply not possible to reconcile the objective of revenue neutrality with the achievement of price neutrality in all cases, given that a single rate of VRT must apply to all models in a particular category.  While a VRT rate that would ensure that no car increases in price is a theoretical possibility, it would <Col N="267" /> expose the Exchequer to a substantial and, therefore, unacceptable loss of revenue. Given that budgetary considerations, especially in the difficult circumstances of 1993, dictate that revenues must be maintained, I have decided that the best approach is to set the rate by reference to RRSPs discounted by 6 per cent, that is slightly less than the current industry average.  This approach will secure the bulk of existing revenues and should also obviate to a considerable extent the need for price increases.  Furthermore, the rate proposed enables those distributors who finally declare OMSPs reflecting discounts of more than 6 per cent to reduce prices slightly.  On this basis the rate applicable to private cars not exceeding 2012 cc will be 25.75 per cent, while for larger cars the rate will be 31.8 per cent &mdash; the current excise duty rate for this category is 24.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>In setting the rate for those vans derived from cars or jeeps, which are currently liable to excise at a rate of 12.5 per cent, I am taking the same broad approach.  However, in recognition of the fact that VAT-registered purchasers account for the bulk of this segment of the market, I propose to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by virtue of the new arrangements.  The make-up of the total tax charge as between VAT and excise/VRT is altered, with the VAT element being reduced.  VRT, unlike VAT, is not reclaimable.  Thus, since the effect of maintaining the total tax charge constant would be to increase the cost to VAT-registered purchasers, the VRT rate of 13.3 per cent which I am proposing for these vehicles should leave the net tax burden unchanged for business purchasers. Furthermore, this rate should facilitate a reduction in the retail price of the vehicles concerned for private customers.</P>
    <P>In the case of both private cars and vans derived from cars and jeeps, I am providing for a minimum VRT charge of £100.</P>
    <P>For motorcycles, the Bill provides for the replication of the existing system as <Col N="268" /> far as possible.  As with cars, the nominal VRT rates will have to be higher than the nominal excise rates being replaced to recover the VAT being lost as a consequence of the exclusion of the new tax from the VAT base.  The rates now being proposed in that context are £2.50 per cc for the first 350 ccs and £1.25 per cc thereafter.  Vehicles such as trucks, lorries and dumpers, which are currently exempt from excise duty, but liable to a £40 administrative registration charge payable to local authorities, will be liable to an equivalent flat-rate registration tax.</P>
    <P>Vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances, which are currently exempt from both excise duty and the present administrative registration charge, will not be liable to any registration charge.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements would, in the absence of offsetting action, reduce the amount of tax deductible for those businesses entitled to a VAT deduction in respect of cars and would thus increase their net costs.  The businesses concerned are car hire, car leasing and driving schools.  In order to leave their tax burden unchanged, I am providing in section 10 for partial refunds of VRT as required.</P>
    <P>In section 7 I am enabling the Revenue Commissioners to establish a facility for the reservation of particular registration numbers with a significance to car owners.  The section also allows the Revenue Commissioners to establish a register of vehicles of persons visiting the State, where temporary registration is required.  This facility replicates an existing system and typically applies in situations where, for example, persons have not yet registered the vehicle in their home country.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that, as part of their functions in enforcing the new vehicle registration tax, officers of the Revenue Commissioners would also have a role in relation to the enforcement of road tax. This new role, which will supplement that of the Garda in this area, should give an additional impetus to curbing road tax evasion.  Section 15 contains the necessary enabling provision in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals for legislation to be included in a second Finance <Col N="269" /> Bill, published on 13 November 1992, also contained a number of measures relating to vehicle licensing i.e. road tax. Chapter II of this Bill, comprising sections 18 to 23, provides for those amendments to the road tax regime that are specifically necessitated by the introduction of the vehicle registration tax.</P>
    <P>Under the revised taxation arrangements whereby registration is now to be administered by the Revenue Commissioners, while road tax will continue to be a matter for the local authorities under the Department of the Environment, it will no longer be possible to simultaneously complete registration and first licensing of a vehicle.  Production of a registration certificate, which will be issued by the Revenue Commissioners, will, in future, be a pre-condition for vehicle licensing.  Section 20 will permit, by way of a good defence mechanism, that a motorist will not be penalised for the use of an unlicensed vehicle provided a licence is obtained within seven days of registration; this will give the motorist sufficient time, following registration, in which to license a vehicle.  To take account of the foregoing provision, the section also provides that a licence shall be due from date of registration, as opposed to date of first use as applies under present arrangements.  Finally, the section will allow a surcharge to be made on arrears of road tax in order to encourage motorists to obtain licences on time in the case of both first licensing and renewals.</P>
    <P>Trade licences have long been available to the members of the motor trade to enable them use unlicensed vehicles in public in the course of their business &mdash; for example for test driving new vehicles. Provision is being made, in section 21, for the continuation of a trade licence system under the new arrangements. However, it is necessary to recast the system in the light of its enhanced importance in the new regime, where it will form part of the control arrangements, not alone for road tax but also for value registration tax.  The revisions made should ensure that the system is not abused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> As recovery vehicles, e.g. tow-trucks, will no longer be permitted to operate using trade licences and will, therefore, require a road tax disc, provision is made in section 22 for the application of an existing road tax rate to such vehicles. Section 23 provides for the repeal of provisions relating to the small administrative registration charge which applied under the system now being replaced.</P>
    <P>I explained at the outset why I had, after careful consideration, concluded that the regulatory route was appropriate in these circumstances to transpose the EC Directives.</P>
    <P>Further regulations will need to be made by the Revenue Commissioners to give detailed, on the ground, effect to the regulations made by me under the European Communities Act, 1972, and, as the power to do so cannot be provided for by way of regulations, provision is included in section 25 for such powers. Similarly, it has been necessary to provide, in the Bill, for the creation of certain penalties and offences to back up the provisions in the ministerial regulations and this is done in sections 26 and 27.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this matter, I wish to stress that neither these regulations nor the Bill deal with actual rates of duty which member states are obliged to respect from 1 January 1993.  In practically all cases, our rates of duty already comply with the relevant provisions.  The exceptions include the duty on heavy fuel oil and the duties on tobacco products. It is considered preferable to deal with the action required as regards rates as part of the normal budgetary process, rather than by way of regulation, even though this course of action means that we will technically be in breach of our EC obligations in the period between 1 January and budget day.</P>
    <P>I also draw the attention of the House to the fact that similar regulations will have to be made to complete the VAT arrangements for the Single Market.  The ECOFIN Council adopted the outstanding technical measures on Monday last and these will have to be transposed into national law as a priority.  I can assure the House that these regulations <Col N="271" /> will be wholly technical and will not impinge on the more substantive issues of rates of VAT.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the abolition of the 3 per cent levy on investments in life assurance products and collective investment undertakings, with effect from a date to be set by Ministerial order.  As the House is aware, during the discussion on the new DIRT provisions in the Finance Bill in May, I undertook to hold discussions with the life assurance companies and others in the financial services industry to consider the impact of the revised DIRT arrangements on the provision of equity finance to Irish industry. Following these discussions, I put forward my proposals for changes in this area in the draft legislation published in November.  These proposals include the introduction of special investment accounts and a change in the taxation arrangements for life assurance products in general.  Both sets of provisions involve the abolition of the 3 per cent levy.</P>
    <P>The special investment accounts were to be operative from the date of capital liberalisation and the new tax arrangements for general life assurance from 1 January 1993.  To delay the introduction of the special investment accounts until significantly later than the special saving accounts could have serious implications for their successful launch.  However, because of the method of collecting tax from such investment products, it is not essential that all the provisions relating to changes in their taxation arrangements be enacted now, and many of them can wait until the next Finance Bill.  In contrast to other taxes on such investments, action needs to be taken now in regard to the 3 per cent levy.  This is because this levy is an upfront charge paid by the investor when the investment is initially made.  It would be very difficult to abolish it retrospectively.  It is, therefore, proposed to provide for its abolition, but to give the Minister for Finance power to give effect to this by order.  This will facilitate the new Government in introducing the proposed special investment accounts at the same time as special savings <Col N="272" /> accounts, should it wish to do so.  It will also facilitate the new Government in introducing a new general regime for life assurance companies from 1 January, should it also so decide.  The final decisions will of course remain to be taken by the new Government.  While the other necessary provisions can be included in the 1993 Finance Bill with retrospective effect, an earlier statement of the Government's intent will be necessary if the special investment accounts are to be introduced at the same time as the special savings accounts.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

The commitments given to us, that only matters necessary and vital to the running of the country had to be enacted by 1 January 1993 would be included, have been breached.  Therefore, neither the Department nor the Minister is now acting in good faith.  This is a very strange way to proceed.  Whereas we thought we had reached agreement that matters of vital interest only would be taken we find now that extraneous matters have been introduced.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i>
        <b>:</b> The practice of legislating by regulation is a very bad one.  The Minister stated he will now enact many agreements already reached at EC level into Irish law by way of regulation.  He states he is empowered to do so under the European Communities Act, 1972.  On the generality of items probably he is so empowered but I wonder whether that power extends to financial items.  The matters in question here are those that involve changes in taxation.  I should have thought that the fact that the Minister's office is a constitutional one, that there are requirements under the Constitution that all financial matters should be authorised by this House, at least renders it questionable that enacting such a wide range of procedures by way of regulation alone is not being done on very strong constitutional ground.  Will the Minister give the House a commitment that at the first available opportunity he will re-enact and allow debate in the House on the matters which says he will now enact by way of regulation?  I believe the Minister is now on very thin ice in regard to constitutional matters such as these.  Throughout the Bill other decisions are being made to take on the power of legislating by way of statutory regulation in matters which should properly come before this House for debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> The Minister referred to the 1992 out-turn. We are happy to note that the year is ending with the figures more or less in line.  Even though Supplementary Estimates were passed yesterday brining forward £71 million of pay commitments into the current year the Minister appears to think the year will still end with the outturn slightly under 3 per cent.  Quite clearly, that is good news.  The Minister referred also to the opening position for 1993.  I presume we shall be hearing more about that as the days go by.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to measures to maintain the yield from VAT in view of the fact that VAT at the point of entry will be abolished from 1 January next. Will he please state what are his intentions about these measures to maintain the yield from VAT?  When replying will he inform the House what precisely he intends doing if he is still in the Administration when the forthcoming budget is introduced.  Will he state what are the present recommended measures in the Department of Finance?  There is no doubt but that the budgetary position in 1993 will be quite tight.  There is no doubt also that almost every financial decision will be made in the shadow of the exchange rate issue.</P>
    <P>If I may be so bold as to comment on the published programmes of the parties now in negotiations to form a Government, while they contain many items of merit, and certainly the Labour-Democratic Left document would envisage a more caring, inclusive society, when it comes to the hard economics either of the Fianna Fáil position or that of the Labour-Democratic Left it seems to me there is no measure at all which will effect any substantial change in the underlying economic position in 1993.  I can identify no proposal that will obviate the need for the Minister to provide for something in the region of, say, 25,000 to 30,000 extra people on the live register in 1993.  I do not see any proposal for any radical change that will alter the underlying position of increasing unemployment, continuing emigration, with more families having to rely on social welfare alone.  I do not see the change, the new departure, that fundamental radical shift of priorities <Col N="275" /> which would be necessary to address the enormity of the problems facing us. However, those matters can be dealt with at another time.</P>
    <P>On the question of deposit interest retention tax the Minister did not specify his estimate of the yield loss by moving down to a rate of 10 per cent.  I understand the figure was somewhere in the region of £90 million and I presume that figure will have been increased in the light of the interest rate increases.  I should like the Minister to give the precise figure.</P>
    <P>I put the proposition to the Minister that the position has changed radically, to the extent that the proposals advanced in his Budget Statement of January last are no longer valid.  Certainly in January last it was fair to assume that on the basis of the interest rates then prevailing when exchange controls would be abolished from 1 January 1993 there would be an outflow of funds from the country, in particular that savers, ordinary citizens with savings, would tend to move their savings to where their net interest yield would be greater, say, to Northern Ireland, into special accounts in the United Kingdom, to Luxembourg, or wherever they would be subjected to a zero rate.  I wonder is that assumption true at this stage?  The Minister should reconsider the position between now and budget day, if he is the Minister who will introduce that budget.  It appears to me that anybody in this jurisdiction at present would be crazy to move money into a United Kingdom deposit account since the relevant interest rates are totally favourable to keeping money on deposit here.  Indeed, the exchange rate risk of moving into the United Kingdom, with a floating £ rather than a fixed exchange rate, would seem to me to be a major inhibiting factor as well to the movement of such money.</P>
    <P>The position within the EC is changing also.  For example, last Monday's <i>Financial Times</i> talked about a certain amount of money moving out of Germany into Luxembourg because in Germany they have introduced a 30 per cent deposit interest retention tax.  It appears to me that throughout the EC &mdash; that is, <Col N="276" /> those countries that do not have it already &mdash; they will introduce deposit interest retention tax.  Would it not be better if some kind of agreement could be reached at EC level rather than writing off a very big yield to the Exchequer from a tax on unearned income?  With our very strong, positive, interest rates those with savings are getting a very good return.  Therefore, it would appear to me there is a case for re-examining whether it is necessary to pull back from 27 per cent to 10 per cent, or if it is found necessary to pull back, what is so relevant about 10 per cent; why not 15 per cent?  In the new circumstances prevailing I do not think the case has been made and since it involves such a huge loss to the Exchequer I contend it warrants reexamination.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the new deposit accounts is to protect the liquidity of the system, to ensure that money does not flow out of the country with the yield to the Exchequer thereby reduced.  Could this not have been done in terms of individual rather than corporate deposits? Could that not have been done by way of regulation?  Does the Minister see any merit at all in re-examining the position? It is now debatable whether the decision taken in January last remains a valid one.</P>
    <P>The question of motor car registration I find extremely disturbing, because we were given to understand that we were coming in to enact, almost on the nod, what the Minister announced in the last budget.  That is not the situation we are presented with.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Faced with this division, it is, as already stated, simply not possible to reconcile the objective of revenue-neutrality with the achievement of price neutrality in all cases, given that a single rate of VRT must apply to all models in a particular category.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on at length to explain the issues.  The bottom line on it is that every person knows now that the Minister is saying that the price of cars will increase.  That is an absolute botch of an arrangement.  I did not come into this House this morning to underpin an increase in the price of motor cars.  I <Col N="277" /> know the Minister will say that I am misrepresenting the position, that some prices will increase while others will reduce and that the Revenue have to strike a balance to protect the yield.</P>
    <P>In the real world, the price of cars will go up in circumstances where the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister are getting an extra take.  Where there is any slight reduction, that, in the traditional manner of Irish business, will not be passed on to the consumer, just as the benefits we were supposed to get from a strong currency were not passed on.</P>
    <P>The Minister this morning is increasing the price of motor cars.  It is all hocuspocus to say that we must be revenue neutral and that we must protect the yield.  That is a bit ironic.  One of the great benefits of the Single Market we were told was that we would have free movement of capital and labour, that we would end up with price equality and that if items were produced more cheaply in other jurisdictions we could get them cheaper here once the Single Market came into operation.</P>
    <P>There was an expectation at one stage that the price of motor cars would reduce dramatically.  The Minister knocked that on the head last January when he said he would have to introduce vehicle registration tax to mop up anything that was lost on excise and that, depending on the model of the car, several thousand pounds will be the contribution on the first time registration tax.  The Minister has gone beyond that now and is adopting this kind of belt and braces approach where the margin is always on the side of the Government and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>He has taken measures this morning to increase the price of cars when the expectation was that the introduction of the Single Market would at least mean that there would be some reduction in the price of cars over the years.  This is outrageous.  We were led to believe that there was no change from the Minister's budgetary position but today we find a new section being introduced which was not in the White Paper published in the course of the election.  We see that the <Col N="278" /> rates will increase the price of cars.  It is very unfair to those Members who are co-operating with the Minister, and the Department, that the Minister is approaching it in this fashion.  There is very little we can do about the fact that we are this morning waving the Minister on as he raises the price of motor cars. We were supposed to do this without even looking at the sections.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We were not even going to have a Committee Stage debate.  This is using the exigencies of the hour to take advantage of Members.  It is a very unfair way to proceed.</P>
      <P>Section 15 is another outrage.  We agreed to deal with matters necessary for the functioning of this country and which were an absolute prerequisite before 1 January and now we have in section 15 the Minister introducing a new power for customs and excise officers which will be the same power as the Garda Síochána in respect of untaxed cars.  This is not a criminal justice Bill; it is not part of a Road Traffic Act.  I did not come here this morning to give extra powers to customs and excise officials to pull people up if they had not taxed their cars.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to agree that customs and excise officials should have a role in the enforcement of the new VRT &mdash; obviously, vehicle registration tax will have to be a matter for such officials &mdash; but I am not prepared to agree that their powers should be extended so that they will have the same powers as the Garda Síochána under the Road Traffic Acts, in respect of car tax.  That goes beyond what we agreed with the Minister and his officials.  I suggest that the Minister delete that because, if he does not, I will be calling a vote against that section.  There is a principle involved here.  As is usual with the Department of Finance, if we give them an inch they will take a mile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are prepared to agree certain matters but the Department is loading more weight on the camel by introducing material to which we did not agree and <Col N="279" /> which is not necessary in this Finance Bill and has nothing to do with the 1 January deadline.  This is just a handy way of giving extra powers to the customs and excise officials and we were expected to wave it through without a Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I am surprised, and very disappointed with the Minister and his officials.  I suggest that the Minister instruct his officials to make the appropriate amendments to section 15 to remove the extra powers being given in respect of road tax.  We did not have any intention of increasing the powers of the Revenue Commissioners today, into an area unrelated to vehicle registration tax.</P>
    <P>With regard to life assurance, the Minister in his speech talked about making more use of regulations.  The DIRT proposals on the special accounts will distort the savings market.  There is no doubt that it will dramatically affect the insurance industry.  The White Paper published in November referred to special equity accounts to be offered to the public by insurance companies, which would level the playing field somewhat and give insurance companies a chance to compete for savings.  I welcome the removal of the 3 per cent levy but I am not sure what the Minister's intention is in respect of equity accounts now.  The Minister said on the one hand that this might be dealt with in the budget and then said he might do this by way of regulation.  Major tax changes should not be made by way of regulation.  That is flying in the face of the democratic procedures of this House.  While technically it may be a correct way to proceed, we are not needed if we can have government by dictat and if the Minister, and his officials, can draw up regulations and promulgate them without having to enter this House.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Whips have agreed to give us some chance to discuss some of these sections in Committee, but I would like the Minister to take what I said to heart.  I do not want to call votes today but, regardless of any prior agreement, if a matter is being introduced in this Bill <Col N="280" /> which is not connected with the 1 January deadline, I will call votes.  The Whips should be notified that this is not by agreement, if it is going to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Miss Burton Miss Burton">
      <NameTxt>Miss Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party consent to the passage of this Bill today, but there are observations I would like to make on various tax policy issues that arise from some of its provisions.  Much of this Bill is technical but it deals with areas of tax policy which represent important tax breaks for certain sectors of Irish society, in particular the corporate and better off sectors.  It is our fundamental belief that tax reform should remain a key element in any strategy to get Ireland back to work and create a fair and just society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the culture of contentment that seems to exist among large sections of our society, with people often being apparently indifferent to the hardship suffered by others, there is a resistance to serious reform within Irish society and I would say also in this Chamber within probably all of the parties, despite the comments made by Deputy Noonan. There is a determination to maintain tax break after tax break for particular sectors. The economic argument for that is that tax breaks will produce jobs, the so-called trickle down theory that enough tax breaks will produce enough jobs. Experience in many other countries shows, however, that as the sole engine of economic growth that is a dangerous illusion and a wrong road to follow.  In a small society such as ours, one end result of the adoption of that policy is the widespread belief that many sectors pay much less than their fair share of tax, which leads to a substantial erosion of confidence in the whole tax system.  It is my belief that that is probably the major moral encouragement to the black economy. It is amazing how much brain-power, intelligence and professional expertise are used to manufacture tax breaks and avoidance schemes.  An example of that in operation has been witnessed in the inspector's report on Telecom.  Ireland is probably unique among countries of its size in that we have <Col N="281" /> more than 1,000 pages of tax legislation. Surely that must be a record of some kind for such a small state.  The consent of the Labour Party to specific measures in the Bill should not be interpreted as blanket support for the philosophy underlying them.  We in the Labour Party have a larger view of the measures that need to be taken for economic growth.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister's comment on the strong corporation tax out-turn.  The move to tax companies has come after a very long and arduous campaign undertaken by the labour and trade union movement.  In fact, that was one of the areas on which I first campaigned when I became involved in politics in the seventies. At that stage we were told that there was simply no money available from the company sector.  Time has proved that those who made the argument for equity in the tax system and for an extension of the tax base were correct.</P>
    <P>In relation to the section of the Bill that deals with the International Financial Services Centre and the Shannon zone, it is understandable and logical that our European neighbours should seek to protect their tax bases.  Many people here fail to understand that in other European countries there is a general belief that companies should pay a minimum contribution and that that concept is vigorously pursued by national legislatures. The Minister should protect Irish interests in our participation in the EC by seeking Community-wide corporate tax bands with special lower levels for industry and sectors with a high job content. If there are special reasons for tax breaks they should be on the grounds of peripherality; tax breaks should be an added incentive to job creation in peripheral areas.  The whole strategy of creating taxation black holes by the Liffey and the Shannon is not in the long term the most conducive method of ensuring the viability of the Shannon zone or of the International Financial Services Centre.  I have no doubt that the action taken by the German Government will be followed by others.  We have had a fair warning from an important European partner that future action may be taken <Col N="282" /> in this area.  We should take heed of that warning in respect of tax plans and policy for the future.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that a certain level of activity has now apparently taken off from the International Financial Services Centre, I believe that a policy of jobs by taxation often results in a shift of jobs from one location to another in the same way that land re-zoning often results in a shift of housing from one location to another rather than a net increase in the total number of houses being built.  I have read the Minister's comments about the jobs and the tax take from the Financial Services Centre but it is my contention that in order to undertake a full analysis of the results of the centre one would need to determine how many jobs and how much tax have simply been transferred from other sectors of the economy and to examine the net position rather than the gross position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the regulations on DIRT, life assurance products and products of the insurance industry, we are faced with a continuing problem concerning investment policy.  It is definitely more profitable to invest money in banks, building societies and property than in projects that will lead to job creation. With reference to the remarks made by Deputy Noonan, this is a problem that has to be addressed by all parties in the House.  In the current crises that have beset the ERM and the performance of the equity market during the past two years, many small investors have been very poorly served by the insurance industry.  There is a need for the provision of more information about the performance of investments.  Many small investors feel that they are charting an unknown course and are given very little information.  The entry cost into insurance industry products is also extremely high.  Very high levels of fees and commissions are taken in the first and early years of investment.  In order to improve the climate of investment in productive industry, rather than simply in risk-free investments, which in Ireland have always tended to veer towards property &mdash; we need to reconsider the way in <Col N="283" /> which tax breaks are structured.  I welcome the Minister's indication that he will attempt to guide investments into productive sectors of Irish industry and into smaller companies as well as the large companies.</P>
    <P>The experience of the BES scheme in the first few years of its operation illustrates just how difficult it is to do that in Ireland.  Although the BES scheme was supposed to be based on jobs and the manufacturing industry, there was a substantial drift by financial advisers towards advising clients to hedge and to guarantee the investments, particularly by reference to property, so that in many ways the fundamental purpose of the scheme was outwitted by essentially tax avoidance mechanisms.  The House will have to tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the vehicle registration proposals, VRT.  I accept the remark made by Deputy Noonan that people will probably be disappointed at the cost of cars in Ireland.  Were Deputy Noonan ever to listen to Gay Byrne or any of the other popular commentators he would realise that people's belief in the ability to purchase cars more cheaply on 1 January 1993 was blown a long time ago.  I do not think many people expected the Minister for Finance to act as Santa Claus to the car market.  It has been confirmed this morning that he does not have any nice presents for that market for this Christmas.  That has been widely known and I am taken aback at the extent of Deputy Noonan's surprise this morning at the news.</P>

      <P>In relation to the VRT we should examine a mechanism for distinguishing between environmentally friendly motor vehicles and those that are grossly polluting.  If we are moving in line with European legislation there is a case to be made for distinguishing between vehicles that are to some extent environmentally <Col N="284" /> friendly and those that are not. I ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
      <P>Taxation of lorries should be examined and perhaps they could be taxed in proportion to axle weight.  The damage caused by lorries to our roads bears very heavily on the local authorities and in Dublin, in particular, it has a major impact on the quality of life for the citizens.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 15 and the additional powers of the Revenue Commissioners, perhaps the Minister would outline to the House how these regulations may be enforced, what powers the officers will be given and how they may be expected to carry them out.  As a fellow Dubliner there is one point of local concern I would like to make to the Minister. Along with the city centre I am sure he is aware that a number of areas of Dublin West particularly in parts of the corporation estates in Blanchardstown and Clondalkin are plagued by sporadic out-breaks of so-called joyriding and vandalism. One of the elements contributing to this problem is the sale of cars for very small sums of money by traders in used cars to young children, in some cases as young as ten years of age.  Perhaps some of the extra powers to be given to the Revenue officers could be used to prevent some of these traders offering for sale cars at £50.  This is a nightmare for the neighbourhoods involved and there is a substantial risk of killing other people. Already there have been a number of deaths in Clondalkin and Ballyfermot.  I do not think it would be a bad measure if we could crack down on this aspect of trading which facilitates joyriding.  I will be interested to hear from the Minister how it is proposed to regulate the activities of the officers and how they are to carry out their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the section dealing with favoured car numbers and temporary registration, I would like some information from the Minister.  Does this mean we will now adopt what was a feature of yuppie life in London in the 1980s where well off people will be able to buy favoured car numbers?  If so, where will the revenue from this go and how much <Col N="285" /> revenue does the Minister anticipate raising from this scheme?  If people want it I suppose there is no objection to it.  I suppose we could have some fun&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with a few of the points raised.  I do not want to repeat points made by others and I do not want to unnecessarily take up the time of the House.  It is reasonable that some of these measures should be taken at this time in order to pass revenue conserving measures that are urgently needed.  We should remind ourselves of the dreadful situation the incoming Administration faces in terms of making the figures match each other in the forthcoming budget.  We cannot afford to indulge in too many romantic notions protesting about this and that in circumstances where the figures themselves require urgent action.  In present circumstances, no responsible Minister for Finance can relax his grip on the flow of revenue to the Exchequer especially in view of the pressures the social expenditures have created on the budgetary situation for next year.  Therefore, if there is room for a marginal increase and I presume the Minister is speaking in good faith when he says the figures have been rounded upwards solely to conserve revenue and are not intended as additional taxation in their own right, I commend the Minister to err on the side <Col N="286" /> of caution.  In the context of the forthcoming budget there is no point in erring on the side of relaxation.</P>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Noonan in relation to EC regulations. The 1972 Act only permits regulations to be made in respect of the State's necessitated obligations under the European treaties.  So far as the State chooses to do it by regulation rather than by legislation one has to bear in mind that that must be constitutionally justifiable.  I believe, and it has been argued by people more learned than I in text books, that the State is unnecessarily and improperly relying on regulations to achieve legislation in areas where there are definite legislative choices being made and it is not simply a matter of implementing in Irish law obligations under European law.</P>
      <P>In particular I agree with Deputy Noonan that this House has a constitutional role in relation to taxation and the public finances and to start taxing the country by way of regulation, by references to the EC treaties and the 1972 Act in my view is extremely suspect. Doubtless somebody some day will challenge one of the regulations made by the Minister and then, at long last, it will be decided that the inconvenience of having legislation pass through this House was a factor that should not have prevented legislation being used where a regulation was abused.  I have no doubt that will happen sometime in the future and who knows what the consequences will be.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Noonan that the Minister is skating on thin ice in making regulations under the 1972 Act in relation to tax gathering matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a point in relation to a matter raised by Deputy Burton.  She said there is an army of people out there one of whose functions is to advise people who have resources on how they can avoid taxation.  In the efforts made by the Minister to avoid artificial linkage of accounts I can see a fairly easy loophole in the proposal made by him.  In his anxiety to prevent accounts being linked together in a manner which exaggerates <Col N="287" /> the interest which is entitled to the 10 per cent rate, the Minister should take into account the fact that it may not be done through the mechanism of accounts; for example, there could be other arrangements such as investments in insurance bonds.  I can think of a stack of things I would do if I were a tax adviser today to get around this measure.  That measure will need further consideration.  I am not offering free counter-avoidance advice to the Minister but it is unfortunate that legislation of this kind has had to be rushed through in circumstances where a better job could have been done if more time were available.  Presumably it can be looked at again in the Finance Bill next year.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the general point about taxation principles made by Deputy Burton.  I agree completely with the philosophy she advanced today in relation to taxation.  I am not being facetious when I say I hope, since the Labour Party will have a pivotal role in whatever transpires in the next few days in terms of giving this country a Government, that that spirit will inform their negotiations and the tax reform will not be forgotten about.  Tax reform seems to be an unfashionable thing at the moment in some of the speeches I have read; it is somehow seen as the obsession of a few people, including me.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear that Deputy Burton shares my philosophy completely in relation to tax reform.  No doubt she would have some different ideas as to the actual structure of the reformed system, but we at least share the common position that the present system of taxation needs radical reform.  I hope the Labour Party, in its relations with whatever party or parties it forms a Government in the future, will bear in mind that this country definitely needs radical tax reform and that the ordinary &ldquo;Joe Soap&rdquo; or &ldquo;Josephine Soap&rdquo; who has to pay outrageous rates of tax on below average industrial earnings is looking to the incoming Government to put these matters right.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to section 15 which proposes to extend the power to impose <Col N="288" /> on-the-spot fines to Customs and Excise officers.  I have no particular objection to officers of Customs and Excise carrying out this function when they, as an arm of the State, stop a car and see that the person driving it is committing an offence or when, during the course of their duties, they see a vehicle on a street which is untaxed.  I have no particular hang-up about whether it is right or wrong to extend powers to them under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a more radical point to the Minister, that a vast amount of State resources is wasted in operating the present on-the-spot fine system.  My pet theory about this system is that the entire criminal sanction should be taken away. It is absurd to have traffic wardens queuing up, taking a Bible in their hands and giving sworn evidence out of a notebook. That system could be made much more effective if the criminal offence which at present lies behind these on-the-spot fines were replaced with a civil tort, a municipal tort, where the local authority would simply enter judgment against the registered owner of a car in a book.  That could be done constitutionally; it does not require a criminal procedure to impose an on-the-spot fine.  The Americans, by citations, completely avoid that entire procedure.</P>
    <P>The Minister could make it a criminal offence not to pay one of these civil penalties which is imposed and hit somebody for £200 or £300 if he did not pay within the time limit provided for payment of the penalty.  If this were done &mdash; I know that in times past the Department of Finance has examined the entire area of fine collection &mdash; I guarantee the Minister that there would be a huge surge in the amount of revenue to the Exchequer and, perhaps, to local authorities.  That is not just a lawyer's view of the matter.  During the course of the election campaign I had a conversation with a traffic warden in Thomas Street who agreed entirely that that is what is required.</P>

      <P>It seems that a little bit of lateral thinking would improve the situation dramatically in many matters, and this is one of them.  Instead of extending the existing creaking scheme which will require Customs and Excise officers to go to court on a particular day and be sworn in relation to the little entry in their notebooks it would be much better to introduce a system which would work and be effective.</P>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Burton about the need to bear in mind environmental considerations in relation to taxation.  However, I thought that in the vast majority of cases VRT would apply only to new cars.  Our anxieties will probably be overcome by the much more stringent pollution controls which are being imposed as a matter of European obligation on new cars than otherwise. The motor taxation requirement might apply to older cars but, as the possessor of an older car, it would be a bit harsh to penalise me for not buying a new car merely because my car is less environmentally friendly than others.</P>
      <P>This is an unwelcome method of doing our business.  It is an efficient method in the sense that a series of measures which are, roughly speaking, uncontroversial, are going through the House in a hurry, but the next Finance Bill should be dealt with in a better way than were the Finance Bills were dealt with when I was previously a Member of this House.  The idea of guillotines and holding up the House for days while Deputy Noonan, Deputy Burton and the Minister, whoever that is &mdash; now that I think about it, one of us could be Minister &mdash; go through the text of a large Finance Bill while other Members are elsewhere is absurd.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the dreamlike state we appear to be in.  The question arises: why are we going through this procedure at this time?  This should be addressed for the future and dealt with in terms of the need for an indepth look at our Constitution.  The position in which we find ourselves today also throws up another area of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of tax reform has been referred to by Deputy McDowell who is fearful that the issue may have fallen off the agenda.  That would certainly be of concern to me and my party as indeed, I believe it would be of concern to most parties.  I do not believe that the general idea of tax reform has fallen off the agenda but that the way in which tax reform has been tackled, both by the last Government and previous Governments, has led to a degree of cynicism among people outside of this House who expected that tax reform would have some alleviating effect on their financial position when they received their salary cheques.  That does not seem to have been the case.  The type of newspaper headlines that we have seen, for instance, indicates that there has been a certain degree of tinkering with the system.  We have had headlines such as &ldquo;Corporate Tax Sector Unpoliced&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Unpaid Tax Totals £2.5 billion&rdquo;.  Indeed, there <Col N="292" /> have been many other headlines generated by the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which scarified the tax paying public.</P>
    <P>There is a need to redefine tax reform and to clarify for everybody what exactly is required.  To most people who consider this question &mdash; I am sure that by and large it is the PAYE tax sector who bear the brunt of the income tax burden and also the indirect taxes such as VAT &mdash; tax reform signifies some financial alleviation. We argued during the election campaign, when launching our tax document, that a good tax system should consist of four basic objectives, objectives which it has to be said, may often conflict. First, it must be fair in the way it provides for the collection of revenue and must recover similar amounts from people and corporate bodies with similar resources; second, it must redistribute income, wealth and work; third, it must collect sufficient revenue for the Government to provide services that are socially necessary; and fourth, it must serve the economic objectives of encouraging enterprise and job creation.</P>
    <P>It has to be said clearly that Irish Governments have focused primarily on the last two objectives, raising revenue and attempting, without much success, to encourage enterprise.  They may have genuinely believed that handing out vast sums of money to industry in tax breaks and subsidies would stimulate job creation, just as they thought that the massive public spending in the late seventies would kick-start the private sector. Clearly, they were wrong and, therefore, there is a need for a fundamental rethink on what precisely tax reform is about.</P>
    <P>By and large the last Government promoted the idea of tax reform on the basis of reducing the rate at which the PAYE sector pays its tax, without attempting to adjust the bands or the levels at which people actually enter the various rates. The net effect of that has been that when the previous existing caretaker Government came into power with promises of tax reform, those in the PAYE sector paid an average of £3,127 and by 1991 this had increased by £438 to £3,565, <Col N="293" /> representing an increase of 14 per cent on average paid by the PAYE employee.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through all the examples of the failure to genuinely shift the tax burden, which is probably the primary concern of the PAYE sector. There are examples of some sectors which have only marginally increased and others which have dramatically fallen in terms of the tax paid by them.  There has not been a perception among the public that the talk about tax reform and the declarations that tax reform was under way has had an impact on the people outside this House who vote and who put a Government into power or who provide opportunities for various parties to gain power by forming a Government through negotiations following an election.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Finance (No. 2) Bill 1992, one could say it is the third attempt to deal with the question of the Single Market which will operate with effect from 1 January 1993.  I do not propose to go into the details that other speakers have covered.  I want to avoid repetition. I consider section 1 of the Bill an extraordinary provision.  It relates to certain companies trading in the International Financial Services Centre and the Shannon Free Airport zone.  The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill states:</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances, (it proposes to) reduce the Irish tax relief to which certain companies trading in the International Financial Services Centre or the Shannon Free Airport Zone would otherwise be entitled.</P>
    <P>It proposes to reduce the Irish tax relief to which certain companies would otherwise be entitled.  In other words, the Minister may by order increase the amount of tax to be paid by a company trading in the International Financial Services Centre or the Shannon Free Airport zone where this will facilitate that company to avoid paying tax in their own country.  Apart from the fact that this section gives the Minister extraordinary powers by order to increase or subsequently decrease or to restore relief in the amount of tax to be paid by a company, it also throws interesting light on <Col N="294" /> the arguments of those who claim that foreign companies based in Ireland cannot be asked to pay their fair share of tax or they will flee.  The background to this is that countries such as Germany, Sweden and the United States are now beginning to move against operations like the International Financial Services Centre and they are taking steps to prevent companies using Ireland as a tax haven in order to avoid liability for tax payments in their own countries.</P>
    <P>I understand that representatives from a number of German banks met the Minister for Finance earlier this year and asked to be allowed to pay three times more corporation tax in order to avoid the effect of new German tax laws.  This must have been an historic occasion, the first time in our financial history where banks have gone to the Minister for Finance and pleaded to be allowed to pay more tax.  It is time to start asking questions about the nature of the International Financial Services Centre operation.  The aim of the centre was supposedly to provide jobs and not simply to establish a tax haven.  While it did provide a badly needed boost for the building industry, which obviously is short term, the centre has failed to provide jobs on the scale forecast.</P>
    <P>When the centre was first planned there were forecasts of 7,000 jobs before 1992.  However, in December of last year the Minister told my colleague, the former Deputy Pat McCartan, that the number of new jobs created up to that point &ldquo;by companies approved to operate from the IFSC&rdquo; was just 986, a long way from the projected 7,000 jobs.  As the Minister's reply admits, these are in companies approved to operate from the IFSC.  Many do not operate from the centre.</P>
    <P>Huge amounts of money are being invested in the IFSC but the advantages to this country are hard to identify. According to a story in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 16 August last, German companies invested more in Ireland in 1991 than in any other country, amounting to £2.5 billion, almost double the level of German investment in France. <Col N="295" /> Only £10 million of this was invested in manufacturing in Ireland, creating about 650 jobs and the balance of the £2.5 billion was believed to be invested in the IFSC, where the six German firms involved created just 55 jobs.  According to my very basic mathematics, that works out at about £45 million per job, surely the most expensive jobs created anywhere in the world.  I ask the Minister to state specifically how many people are working in the IFSC and how many of these are new jobs.  I also ask him to give the total of public money spent on the IFSC since it was first announced.  Will he indicate the steps he is taking to deal with the brass plate operations, companies which have been licensed to operate from the IFSC and who enjoy the tax benefits but who still have not moved in? It was reported in various newspapers during the summer that only 22 of the 137 companies licensed to operate in the centre had actually moved in.  Is that still the position?  Will the Minister claw back the tax concessions given to companies which have not moved in?  Is the new tax contained in this Bill to be restricted to companies actually operating in the centre, as distinct from more brass plate operations?</P>
    <P>It is time to look at the entire concept of operations like the IFSC.  Other countries are becoming more determined that these centres will not be used as tax havens and that is a reasonable position from the point of view of German or Swedish workers.  Should we not put time, effort and money into creating productive jobs in indigenous industries based on our own resources, as has been recommended in virtually every report on job creation produced in the past two decades?</P>
    <P>The other major provision in this Bill relates to the new vehicle registration tax. This is to provide for a replacement for excise duties which are due to be abolished from 1 January next under the rules of the Internal Market.  There is probably at this point no alternative because simply to do away with excise duties would result in a huge drop in revenue to <Col N="296" /> the Exchequer.  However, many people, motorists in particular, will feel they have been cheated.  When we first entered the European Community we were told that one of the great advantages for Irish people, apart from the possibility of getting continental weather as promised by one speaker, would be the removal of tariffs and excise duties so that goods, including cars, would be available to Irish consumers at roughly the same cost as to consumers in other European countries. This, we were told, would help compensate for sacrifices in other areas, including the loss of jobs in traditional industries, such as the motor assembly industry.  While the Irish motor assembly industry is dead and gone, Irish motorists still face the position that the prices of their cars are well in excess of those in other EC countries.  A large proportion of our population still live in scattered rural areas, away from shops and other services.  For them a car is not a luxury but a necessity, especially in view of the poor public transport infrastructure in some of these areas.  We should not have to accept on a permanent basis that cars will be much more expensive here than in the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>Our position in relation to this Bill is somewhat unreal.  I cannot see how anything the Minister is proposing can effectively be changed.  Apart from the question of the numbers on the Government side and the risks that would be involved and the constitutional turmoil that would be created if they were defeated on any point, there is also the question of the time constraint on this debate.  I conclude in order to allow Committee Stage to commence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly try to do that.  The preparation of this Bill took place mainly during October and it was ready for issue in early November.  The Dáil was dissolved before that.  I proceeded to request permission from the Ceann <Col N="297" /> Comhairle's Office to publish the Bill, but I found this could not be done once the House had been dissolved.  However, it could be issued in the form of a White Paper and this was the course of action followed.</P>
      <P>In view of the inconclusive result of the election and the uncertainty regarding my position and that of my party, we felt it was unnecessary to go ahead with provisions relating to the BES and other schemes.  I reviewed the contents of the Bill and removed everything that was advised as being unnecessary by Revenue, the Department of Finance and others.  While Deputy Noonan and others were talking, it was my responsibility as Minister for Finance in this Government to complete the work.  I asked my officials and colleagues to make sure that the Opposition spokespersons were briefed.</P>
      <P>I understood Deputy Noonan was briefed on the contents of this Bill but I do not know whether that briefing extended to every section of the Bill. No provisions were slipped in.  I have to confess that since the election the length of time I have spent examining the work I had done prior to the election has not been great, other than to make sure that everything necessary was included. Before the Bill was published I was not very concerned about what was in or out, other than what was legally proper to be enacted before the end of the year. Deputy Noonan has always been very constructive during my period in office and I want to assure him that nothing was done in bad faith.  I hope he will accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputies Noonan and McDonnell in regard to regulations.  It took me six hours to read through the briefs on that some time ago.  I have to say that if I had been given it as primary legislation I do not think I would have spent six hours reading it.  However, I learned in my previous job in the Department of Labour when I once signed regulations in regard to oil tanks and road safety and found a week later that there was a tragedy which was not covered by the regulations, that one must be very careful <Col N="298" /> to read regulations even more closely than primary legislation.  If it had been possible I would have done it another way, because there is a huge number of regulations.  I do not altogether want to apportion blame for what happened in the recent election.  Our colleagues in Europe have not been as speedy as they might have been in tidying up these regulations; we spent right up to the August holidays going through the regulations to clear things, finishing up at about midnight on 31 July.  I thought they were all concluded.  However, under the British Presidency these matters were not finally tidied up until this Monday.  Many months have drifted by without much progress.  However, they are there now and it is essential that they be there.</P>
    <P>In regard to vehicle registration tax, unfortunately I do not have the time to go through all the questions that were raised.  However, because of the major changes the motor industry have been closely involved in all the discussions to make sure that this system works.  Rolling it all through without complying with the provisions would have made it unworkable. Previously the system was quite simple; half a dozen importers dealt with car importation.  Now things are far more complex.  I want to record the good will of the people involved in the industry. This involves very substantial changes for them and naturally we have to negotiate these changes and obtain the good will of those involved in the industry.  They spent weeks during the course of the last year arriving at this system.  While there may be some ups, there are also plenty of downs.  I acknowledge the point made by Deputy McDowell about the difficulties. I still have shivers about the new system in the context of the protection of revenue.  Deputy McDowell spoke about loopholes in another area and I agree with him.  I do not think one would have to delve too far into the new system of examining vehicle registration to see how easy it is to get around vehicle registration when we have customs people at our ports.  One can easily see what the difficulties of the present system would be.  They are quite horrendous and I think <Col N="299" /> Deputy Noonan knows that.  We must be very careful on this one.</P>
    <P>In regard to taxation principles, during 1992 I took my fair share of criticism in regard to taxation reforms and loopholes. Whoever holds the office of Minister for Finance when the new Government is formed will need to be very careful. Having been through the talks in 1991 on the Programme for Government, I agreed with the removal of concessionary rates of tax.  However, behind the removal of every concessionary tax rate there is a lobby that comes with heavy powers and they do not go away too easily; they descend first on the Minister, then on his officials and then, if that does not work, they descend on everyone else in the House to try to force the Minister to change.  I did not do too many U-turns during the year, and I am proud of that. However, removing concessionary tax rates is not an easy job.  I still agree with the views on tax reform.  In 1992 I removed about 47 loopholes.  The problem is that everybody agrees with the removal of loopholes except the one that affects them.  There will always be absolute support from the world, from every international body from the OECD and IMF to the ESRI, but they can all make an exception of the one that affects them. We make changes in income tax and everybody must accept that.</P>
    <P>On section 15 dealing with enforcement, I do not want to be in any way unfair to Deputy Noonan or to anyone else in the House.  Deputy Noonan's criticism of section 15 is on the grounds that it was an inappropriate provision in the Bill.  I should make it clear that this includes section 60 of the proposals published in November.  As far back as April I signalled very clearly &mdash; and I will be glad to provide the Deputy with a transcript because of the circumstances of this debate &mdash; that this would fulfil a dual purpose in that it gives the Garda a role in the enforcement of the VRT and enables the customs officers, in the course of their duties in relation to the VRT, to take whatever action is necessary in cases of non-compliance with the road tax <Col N="300" /> requirements.  I know Deputy Noonan has no wish to make life easier for people who do not wish to pay the tax.  The powers here are similar to those already available to traffic wardens in relation to road tax.  Discussions are taking place in the Department of Justice with regard to the operational arrangements which will apply in relation to enforcement by customs officers.  If it would make Deputy Noonan happier I would be glad to say that no arrangements will be put into operation until they are cleared with the spokesman for Finance or by the House or by some other mechanism.  I am as sensitive to the powers of the Revenue Commissioners as everybody else.  To answer Deputy De Rossa, the reason I put this in is that the excise powers will be gone in a matter of days.  The position will not be the same on 1 January.  The bottom comes out of the system then.</P>

      <P>The excise system that is here at the moment will be finished, with huge revenue losses.  How are we to protect our revenue base if somebody can drive from Rosslare without even having to wave to the customs man who, if he was in a good humour, would let them through, and maybe somewhere in the Wicklow hills or in Waterford they might be unlucky enough to run into a revenue person?  This is a new regime and a major change.

    <P>In relation to the loopholes with regard to DIRT, the Deputy has a point; the position has changed a lot since 29 January when I announced the new provisions. It would be good if the Deputy could predict what the position might be in a few months time.  In relation to the loopholes and the operational rules for DIRT, the Department will have to keep a close eye on the position and I have no doubt that changes will be made in 1993 in this regard.  It would not be appropriate for me to pontificate on what might or might not happen in the 1993 budget.</P>

      <P>Deputy Doyle raised the question of overspending.  This occurred primarily in the area of social welfare because of the unfortunate ongoing rise in the unemployment register and in the health sector despite the major increases announced in the budgets of 1990, 1991 and 1992 and the supplementary budget following the 1989 election, and by the end of the year, it will still be outside the adjusted figure which was agreed by the Cabinet in July. This covers mainly the old reliables &mdash; the general hospital service and particularly the GMS system.  I hope the new arrangements entered into with the Minister for Health will prove to be of help but we can only wait and see.  Finally, because the unemployment figure is still rising related expenditure, such as expenditure on health clinics and rent allowances, continue to overrun the budget allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relevant provisions in the 1993 Estimates which I completed last week and which will be available to the new Minister for Finance will show increases in these areas.  As I said yesterday and again this morning, the unemployment figure has increased significantly with the result that the figures for 1993 are higher <Col N="302" /> than expected.  Because it will be impossible to make reductions in these areas other areas will have to be looked at and other ways considered.  However, that is an issue the incoming Government will have to address immediately.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate what Deputy McDowell said today; there are no easy solutions. Because of the cutbacks in public expenditure in the past few years and the necessity to comply with the European Monetary Union criteria, hard decisions will have to be made; there are no easy decisions.  As I said, this matter will have to be considered in due course.</P>

      <P>Should IFC companies find themselves in difficulty operating double taxation agreements or the certificates under which they operate they would have to renegotiate with the Department of Finance so that a higher rate of tax is charged.  Some of the bigger IFC companies have found themselves in difficulty and were not trying to defraud the Exchequer.  We are talking here about significant international companies.  For instance, I am aware, as Deputy De Rossa said, that some German companies have found themselves in difficulty in relation to DTA agreements but they were not the only ones.  French and Danish companies have also found themselves in difficulty for differing reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer Deputy Noonan's question, should they, for any reason find themselves in difficulty they would have to make their case to the Department which would then amend or take back the certificate or enter into new arrangements <Col N="303" /> with the company.  We have discussed the difficulties the German companies found themselves in with the European Commission and the German authorities as it is my view, given that we have received the approval of the European Commission for the special 10 per cent rate, that the Department could not make a private deal with a company without seeking the sanction of the European Commission and without there being a clear understanding with the member state; otherwise we could discredit the centre very quickly and it could be associated with the title &ldquo;brass plate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In each case the company concerned would have to make its presentation to the Department which would have to be satisfied that it complies with the terms of this section and the relevant legislation in relation to the certification of IFC companies &mdash; a separate section in the Department deals with this matter &mdash; and is in line with Community law before it gives the company what, presumably, would be a higher tax rate.</P>

      <P>That is not the case. The German argument is that the Irish rate for International Financial Services Centre companies is too low.  What we are doing is increasing the rate of the Irish company.  In the DTA agreements with Germany, it would tax these companies on its own basis.  This measure is a concession to enable companies to continue in business.  From our point of view the corporation tax yield will be greater.  That is the reason this system will have to be monitored.  As the Danish Minister said, if this concession is not sparingly and carefully given people would believe, as Deputy Burton has said, that companies could pay a tax rate of 15 or 20 per cent in Ireland and operate in whatever way they wished.  Every case would have to be carefully monitored. Prior to the election I considered this matter very carefully and only a handful of companies are entitled to special investment certificates.</P>

As Deputy McDowell and Deputy Noonan mentioned earlier, as we proceed we will probably need to make more amendments in this area.  The question was raised earlier as to the changed circumstances and how we would deal with some of the changes on an ongoing basis.  As accountancy and banking groups raise questions we try to deal with them in the Department.  The question of pension funds and insurance investments has been raised but this is not a matter that has caused a major <Col N="307" /> problem yet.  As Deputy Noonan said, the attractions that originally existed when we discussed this matter in great detail in May may not be there now, but they may arise in the future.

In my earlier months as Minister for Finance the banking groups suggested that if we did not bring in a deposit interest retention tax arrangement of 10 per cent they would be advertising on hoardings that this is what people would do.

      <P>Arising out of section 3 (b), in the case of the justifiable concern to close down back-to-back arrangements which artificially inflate interest subject to special relief, there is a definite danger that these accounts may become unattractive because, on many occasions, people use deposit accounts as collateral for other borrowings.  If a person has a sum of money deposited in one account and needs to borrow more money he will be asked to back one up against the other by the bank or to provide security interest for the bank.  I do not know what can be done to resolve this problem but whatever formula the Minister proposes should not exclude people using these accounts as security for other borrowings and sub-paragraph (aaa) is somewhat restrictive in that regard.</P>

      <P>That was dealt with in the White Paper published in November last and I agree that it is an urgent problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will examine the point raised by Deputy Michael McDowell.  We have gone to great lengths to try to make such an account as attractive as possible and its operation as simple as possible and at the same time to fulfil the criteria in regard to capital liberalisation.  In regard to Deputy Noonan's concern, I am fearful of how people can operate different <Col N="309" /> methods of saving not just here but elsewhere. It is big business and is similar to some of the difficulties experienced in regard to exchange controls.  In a European context one must consider the amount of money tied into savings accounts, the number of people involved the numbers involved in the exchange market and the difficulties a single currency could have for many industries. During the past year I met many groups who have been affected in one way or another by border controls and who will not make the same mistakes again.  I am sure that during the election campaign every Deputy met people whose lives have been altered because of the currency changes and I am sure Deputy Doyle is well aware of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Finance I had to deal with many problems of customs controls.  For example, one must consider what it would mean for many groups if in 1997, five years from today, a Minister for Finance stood up here and said that the single currency will be effective from 1 January 1998.  That is why many groups and bodies will be examining various methods of saving and this will be a major part of the ongoing debate on Maastricht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Doyle, the special investment accounts will have a tax rate of 10 per cent, provided that a percentage of that is invested in Irish equities.  The rate of 40 per cent will apply for the first year, rising to 55 per cent in the fourth year and a percentage will also be invested in smaller companies, rising from 6 per cent to 15 per cent.  A special tax incentive will also apply to venture capital.  The companies involved wanted a straight rate of 10 per cent on parity.  It was because of the logic of DIRT accounts and because the money was kept in Ireland as distinct from elsewhere that it was fair that there should be a <i>quid pro quo</i>, not just on equities but on seed capital for smaller companies.  Regardless <Col N="310" /> of what rates or incentives applied to Irish equities over the past few months it would have been difficult to stimulate much activity, but one does not legislate for extraordinary times.  I am sure none of us believes that these times will always exist, at least we hope not.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the rate of 40 per cent in the first year is unfair when one considers the figures in regard to pensions, insurance and so on.  I do not wish to pick any one section for fear of upsetting the industry.  There must be a correlation between the incentives of tax breaks to entice people to at least keep a proportion of money in Irish equities and the help we give small companies. The companies would prefer if they had total freedom in this regard.  However, people involved in companies, such as board members, have been very supportive of these proposals.  I accept that these are not normal times and I will supply the Deputy with full details of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Miss Burton Miss Burton">
      <NameTxt>Miss Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister enlighten us further in relation to investment in Irish equities?  I welcome the fact that he is trying to achieve a stipulation that there will be some investment in Irish equities but there was reference in the White Paper to a minimum percentage of total investment in smaller Irish companies with the market capitalisation of less than £100 million.  Is that the total investment or is it per Irish company?  A company worth £100 million would be a fairly large company in our terms.  Without labouring the point, the core of the problem is that it is simply too attractive in Ireland to invest in property and make risk free investments as opposed to making job related investments. If the purpose is to try to target investment in job growth areas it is a very restrictive stipulation.  Will the Minister expand in relation to the smaller Irish companies?</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a matter to which the Minister alluded pertaining to <Col N="312" /> Part II of the Bill.  Perhaps the Chair would prefer me to raise it later, I will be guided by you.  The Minister stated that Part II dealt with customs and excise measures arising from the completion of the Single Internal Market which, as we know, must be in place by 1 January 1993.  I had hoped that the Minister would have made provision for an aspect of this measure, if he had, it would have been in this Part or in Chapter II.  I should like guidance in regard to this matter.  What does the Minister intend to do for the customs clearance and freight forwarders who have been displaced from their employment by the completion of the Single Internal Market?  The Minister knows that over 1,000 people will be made redundant from 1 January 1993; they will not even be phased out.  What precise plans have the Minister and the Department of Finance to compensate, relocate or retain these people?  If we created an industry which employed 1,000 people there would be banner headlines in the newspapers and it would be the first item of news on television and radio.  These people will be out of work and will have very little chance of redeployment.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  We need to <Col N="313" /> know the precise measures which the Minister intends to implement to ensure that these 1,000 people in Rosslare Harbour, along the Border and in Cork and Dublin, where the authorities will have totally changed functions because of our compliance with the Single Internal Market, will be looked after.  I understand that the Minister has powers to draw down moneys from Europe and that he has been in contact with Madame Scrivener in relation to compensation. When our farmers had to reduce production and quotas were introduced compensation measures were put in place &mdash; they are part of the private sector.  When the steel industry throughout Europe over the last 20 years was displaced compensation measures were put in place; the same applied to the car manufacturing industry in certain countries.  This is a recognised procedure within the Community. For some reason, only a fortnight before 1 January, after a year's negotiation in this country and two or three years' negotiation in other countries, we still do not seem to have a programme of compensation or redeployment in place for these 1,000 workers who are critical to our economy.  I do not have to remind the House that we cannot afford another 1,000 people joining the dole queues.  We need to hear precise, specific measures and detailed plans from the Minister in regard to what he and his Department intend to do for these 1,000 people who will be displaced.</P>

We could also deal with the implications of the vehicle registration tax which is also mentioned in this Chapter.  I know that each section must be agreed separately but I should like to deal with the point raised by Deputy Doyle.  We are very concerned about these officers who have acquired special expertise over the years.  I understand that section 15 addresses this problem in a particular way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I will speak on section 15 because I want to refer to the vehicle registration tax.  The common borders will be in place on 1 January and I have already seen documentation from other countries outlining the changes. There will not be green or red channels through which people must pass at customs but they are retaining the right to have on the spot checks at customs offices and throughout the country.  This is because we must be vigilant in relation to terrorism, the movement of illicit drugs, video nasties and all the other items specified in previous legislation.</P>
      <P>I might add that Deputy Noonan was involved in the passage of earlier legislation that laid down specific roles for Customs and Excise and Revenue officers outside their normal jurisdiction and which if we did not enact would have meant we would have encountered difficulty in that the Garda would not have been in a position to apply the legal rules and regulations.  The provisions of section 15 constitutes a move towards the elimination of that dilemma all of us will face on 1 January next.  There are many other roles available to these officers who will have been expertly trained over many years.  I contend that these provisions will also protect the tax base in some way where the common good is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few specific queries to put to the Minister in regard to the vehicle registration tax along with a few inquiries made of me by constituents.  Of course it has to be said that, whenever changes are effected in this area, there will always be special cases advanced.  As my colleague Deputy Burton said, although everybody expressed disappointment they were aware that the State, in this move to a <Col N="315" /> free market on 1 January next, could not ensure that everything would be cheaper on the basis that customs and excise duties and VAT rates would be harmonised within the EC under the provisions of the Single European Act.  I think Gay Byrne was the last person to realise that this does not mean there will be free lunches generally available to people.</P>
    <P>If the tax base was to be protected some alternative instrument had to be put in place, which is the vehicle registration tax.  In recent months, in the knowledge that the position will change from 1 January next, Irish people working abroad who had purchased a car abroad &mdash; which they had brought home under the six months regime which allowed them do so &mdash; are faced with the decision of leaving the car at home altogether.  They will already have notified Customs and Excise that they were bringing the car into the country and intended to retain it here for six months under the old regime.  But if they decide to retain the car here indefinitely it will have to be re-registered in Ireland.  Having imported that car the question arises whether they will be faced with paying import duty in addition to the new vehicle registration tax, or whether they will have to pay one or the other only.  Will there be options open to them or will they have to export such cars before importing them again?  I was unable to answer constituents' inquiries as to what was the correct procedure in such circumstances.  Those cars are at present in Ireland where I hope my constituents will be able to retain them and have them registered, in respect of which there will be a fee to be paid.  The question arises: will they be given retrospective clearance by Customs and Excise officers so that they can pay this vehicle registration tax or, if given the option, will they be enabled to pay the Customs and Excise import duty and register the car under the procedures practised heretofore?</P>
    <P>As the present acting, temporary, resigned Minister for Finance, can the Minister tell me whether we can eliminate <Col N="316" /> the anomaly that has arisen <i>vis-àvis</i> vehicle registration.  I will cite for the Minister my experience.  It is said at the bottom of vehicle registration booklets issued by relevant local authorities that the name appearing on the registration book is not proof of ownership of the vehicle.  May I take the Minister back into the car hire and sales business, to the case of a particular company at present before the courts which I am prohibited from mentioning because the matter is <i>sub judice</i>.  That company had a car registered in their name as a demonstration model.  Unfortunately, I purchased that vehicle in good faith from a bona fide dealer in whose name the vehicle was registered.  I traded in my previous car, paid the price difference, had the vehicle registered in my name, thinking all was in order.  Then some four, five or six months later the company from whom I had purchased the car was discovered to be defective, having three or four different financial arrangements for many cars, including the one I had purchased.  Had I acquired that car on a hire purchase or other financial arrangement &mdash; since there is a facility available to hire purchase companies and to the motor industry &mdash; since my car was already the subject of a hire purchase agreement it would have featured in a bureau which would have revealed that it was already the subject of an unredeemed hire purchase arrangement, thereby prohibiting me from entering into such agreement. As the bona fide purchaser of a car from a main motor dealer how was I to know they had already traded that car, without having changed the registration book, to two different owners, one a finance company, the other a bank and, finally, a selfdrive subsidiary company of theirs?  I am now being told by the finance company, one of the most reputable nationwide: &ldquo;that is our car you have there&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy needs to go to a good TD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>But for the fact that I am a public representative the company might well have taken the car from me already. <Col N="317" /> Initially I was told I would be covered under the hire purchase arrangement already obtaining but I find I am not because I was unaware that they had re-traded the car several times without changing the registration book.  This is the reason I am raising the matter under this section.  I contend we shall have to address the legality of the vehicle registration book so that people will be unable to register a car in their name unless they can prove ownership.  This step should be taken to protect people henceforth who purchase a vehicle in good faith from an otherwise reputable dealer.  In my case the vehicle was not the property of the garage to sell to me in the first place because it had already been hawked through three or four different finance companies.  I can give the Minister the relevant evidence.  The company are quoting legal precedents beyond the jurisdiction when people sold cars they had stolen, or people who had bought vehicles on the strength of hire purchase agreements, resprayed them and sold them on, when the law was found to be on the side of the person who had sold the car the purchaser apparently having no protection.  It seems the motor industry is protected in this respect, whereas the ordinary citizen &mdash; unaware that the product they were buying was not a legitimate one &mdash; is not so protected.</P>
      <P>We must address that anomaly relation to the vehicle registration book.  I do not know what day of the week these people may come and endeavour to take my car from me, for which I have paid, having traded in my previous one to do so.  There is a lesson to be learned by everybody from that experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might also examine the anomaly that will arise under the same system when, occasioned by the demand from the Irish tourist industry &mdash; not met in peak periods this year but which I hope will be with a good tourist season next year &mdash; car hire companies in Britain may have a car in this country temporarily for the purpose of hiring by tourists, especially if such car hire companies have links with other European car rental companies. <Col N="318" /> Will the Minister say what provision will be made for the temporary importation of vehicles here to be used by tourists, being returned to the home base, because I presume they will bear the registration of another country while here.</P>
    <P>I hope my experience will serve as an example of the types of difficulties that can be encountered in this area.  Having paid for a vehicle, having traded in another, one can finish up without anything, except a demand from a bank to whom one owes nothing, who come looking for their debt in accordance with some obscure law.  This was my only opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister.  I wanted to do so before the end of the year because I do not know what will be the decision of the courts in the early months of 1993.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I indicate that the case I was making was specifically for the customs clearance and freight forwarders, part of the private sector, in Rosslare Harbour &mdash; if I may be excused for being parochial for a moment &mdash; where the Customs and Excise officials are being absorbed into the vehicle registration tax office to be located there. There could still be a problem encountered in relation to Customs and Excise officials along the Border in other areas with which I am not familiar.  Perhaps it was to that Deputy Ferris was referring.</P>
      <P>We might now distinguish clearly between the difficulties encountered in the private sector, on the completion of the internal market, and those encountered in the public sector.  Quite obviously, the responsibility of the State to the public sector is at a slightly different level from that to the private sector, even though I contend they have an absolute responsibility to the private sector as well, who are being displaced for the greater good of us all, if you like, to ensure that the Community works as intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I add to the catalogue of individual problems which have just been raised by the Deputy on the Labour benches?  In my county there is a very <Col N="319" /> vexed case of a priest who was located in Northern Ireland for two or three years and who has now been sent to Rome for two years.  When he left the North he left his two-year-old car with his father at the family home in Wexford rather than bringing it to Rome where he would not need it.  He is now being asked to pay higher rates of excise duty to have the car registered in the Republic, even though it is a two-year-old car.  The man is being treated as if he were a criminal.  He is being forced to come back from Rome to appear in person before the Customs and Excise people in Wexford in order to register the car.  In the meantime nothing can be done with it.  There appears to be a great deal of red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy with regard to honest, decent people who are not trying to evade the law.</P>
    <P>We should urgently examine the system of importing cars.  Perhaps the Minister can give an assurance that on 1 January there will be a common sense approach to this area so that we will not spend scarce human resources chasing people who are not trying to defraud the State and that we get on with the job of sorting out criminals who are wreaking havoc in our community.  I could list five or six incidents.</P>
    <P>A member of the London Customs and Excise staff lives in Wexford and commutes via Rosslare.  Her husband, an invalid, lives in Wexford.  Inadvertently, she left her English registered car with her husband at one stage and the Customs and Excise officers nabbed him, there was a big scene and money was extracted.  That person is actually a member of the UK Customs authorities and she had no intention of defrauding the State.  If intelligent educated people find themselves on the wrong side of the law, is it any wonder that ordinary citizens who cannot or do not read the small print on the back of some abstruse form get into trouble?  I appeal to the Minister to sort out this crazy system in relation to the importation of cars by honest people.</P>
    <P>The problem which Deputy Ferris mentioned could be solved if the car <Col N="320" /> registration book, the subject of a transaction with a finance company, was stamped by the finance company so that, before a person purchased a car, he could check everything was in order and the purchase was within the law.  We could have a simple system of endorsing what we refer to as the tax book, but which, more properly, is the registration book. Perhaps that could be looked into because it would appear that not only was the last speaker caught, but 300 or 400 others are in the same position in his part of the country.  That problem could be rectified very simply.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> While we are on constituency problems, I know of a young Irish emigrant in London who has a car there and who signed on to work for Concern in Africa.  He brought the car home to Limerick to put it in his father's garage for 12 months and the customs officers are insisting that he pays full importation VAT and excise or, alternatively, that he sells the car.  Such practice does not make much sense.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on how he envisages this &ldquo;double zz register&rdquo; working under section 7?  Whether we fully understand it will depend on the regulations the Minister will introduce.  He might throw some light on that.  Does it mean that any Irish resident in the UK can keep a car here?  Is it only confined to companies or does it mean a car could be kept here but not used?</P>

      <P>On the question of staff concerns and the concerns of agents, we resolved the problems of the 608 customs staff because they were public servants who could be transferred and redeployed. Since the agents are not public servants but work with private companies, nothing could be done for them in terms of redeployment because the functions they carried out were no longer relevant.  I have pursued their case with Madame Scrivener for some months now.  She was here in June and we discussed this matter and other matters with her.  There is a 30 million ECU fund available for distribution through some <Col N="321" /> mechanism to be agreed on a Community basis.  In the beginning we did not have a fund but following efforts from countries, including Ireland, the fund is now available. I do not have the up-to-date position on it.  The issue was to find a mechanism to use the funds for compensation.</P>

There are half a dozen houses in Rosslare Harbour coming up for sale already because of the difficulty there and this also applies to the rest of the country.  I urge the Minister to make every effort to solve this enormous problem.  There are 63,000 of these people in Europe and nothing is being done for them except in the Netherlands where they came up with a package.  There are 1,000 of these people in Ireland; 35 in Rosslare.

      <P>Deputy Doyle referred to unnecessary red tape.  Everybody in the House can tell us about individuals who, through misfortune, misunderstanding or taking a chance, got into difficulties.  I have come across all types of cases, from those who tried to abuse the system to those who did not understand the law.  I accept what Deputies say and I have met people of the highest integrity who seem to walk into trouble and I know they are not all trying to beat the system.  Unfortunately, the red tape is necessary.  As in all such matters if one were dealing with decent people only there would be no need for red tape.  Abuse has been widespread in recent years and it is not new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were raised regarding transfer of residence and there are EC regulations in regard to this.  About 1,200 cars are seized every year.  In most cases seizure would not result from a mistake being made.  This area, obviously, needs to be tidied up and I shall certainly request my colleagues in Revenue, who are conscious of the issues, to examine the whole matter.  Under the new regime we will have to be very vigilant in relation to abuse.  In the past year, when I had access to the files, I learned of horrendous cases of abuse and was surprised at some of the tricks people were up to. I accept that there are decent people and there are people who are making life difficult in this regard.  In reply to Deputy Ferris, I wish to say that the transitional measure will cater for people already abroad.  They may well not be any worse <Col N="323" /> off than under the system operated at present.  Retrospective entitlement to the exemption will depend upon whether an entitlement already exists.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak on the hire purchase problem also.  The existing registration system provides for the use of a log book, which merely records the name of the person using the car based on his or her own declaration.  The log book has no bearing on title to the car.  The new system will not in any way impinge on those arrangements.  In some ways the issue raised by the Deputy is a consumer protection issue and could be considered in that light.  I shall certainly take account of the advice offered by Deputy Ferris.  I know something about the case involved.</P>

      <P>New paragraphs (e) to (i) to be added to section 131 (1) of the 1992 Finance Act give the Commissioners the power to set up and maintain a special register for vehicles of persons visiting the State, where those persons require temporary registration facilities.  Such facilities may be offered to visitors to the State purchasing new vehicles for export from the State or to visitors who temporarily bring vehicles into the State but do not wish or are not in a position to display their domestic registration plates, for example, for security reasons.  This provision reflects the current legislative position.</P>

        <b>:</b> I think a serious issue arises here.  In the last Finance Act a whole lot of new powers were conferred on Customs officers in respect of enforcement of the tax code. Now the powers of the Garda Síochána are being extended to customs officials in respect of car tax.  I have no problem with the customs officials being empowered to enforce the requirements of the vehicle registration tax but for ordinary road tax I wonder how it will work in practice.  For example, if somebody is driving home can a customs official in civilian clothing wave them down and ask them to produce the book, and check their car <Col N="328" /> tax?  Can they caution them in the normal Garda manner and would a summons issue?  That is a very serious matter in respect of something like that. Obviously, they could dip the tank to check whether the proper fuel was being used.  Can they check for bald tyres, tail lights and so on?  How far does their power extend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure Deputy Noonan that none of these things are considered and there is no question of customs officials waving down or stopping vehicles.  Revenue now has an involvement in vehicle registration tax but previously they were responsible for excise tax and they did wave down vehicles.  Only in relation to vehicle registration tax would they see themselves as having a role.  From reading the section it appears that their role would be broader than that.  I am happy that no operational regulation can be introduced under the Act until their functions are clear.  Revenue do not want to be involved in the task of road blocks &mdash; that is not their function &mdash; nor do they wish to be involved in controversy concerning their powers.  They want to work with people, to comply with regulations and do not wish to be seen as hostile.  Before section 15 is implemented we will bring forward regulations and state precisely how they will have an involvement.  Revenue's own observation is that it may be beneficial if they could issue a summons but not be involved directly in consultation as that is not a task in which they would wish to be involved.  That could be made clear in regulations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that, as part of their functions in enforcing the new vehicle registration tax, officers of the Revenue Commissioners would also have a role in relation to the enforcement of road tax.  This new role, which will <Col N="329" /> supplement that of the gardaí in this area, should give an additional impetus to curbing road tax evasion.</P>

        <b>:</b> Of course they did not.  The Minister is making no distinction in the section but is extending the powers of customs officers and is giving them the same power as the Garda in respect of the enforcement of road tax.  Garda powers in respect of road tax do not relate simply to stationary vehicles.  They man check points, wave down vehicles and inspect tax and insurance.  The manner in which the section is drafted suggests that customs officers are given the same powers.  I do not see how a code of practice will change it.  The Minister may issue some instruction to Revenue not to do that but still they will be legally entitled to do so.  I am prepared to hear the case but I do not think that what is effectively emergency legislation, to meet an end-of-year deadline, <Col N="330" /> is the appropriate place to do that kind of thing.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether a non-uniformed garda is entitled to hail down traffic.  That may or may not be the case.  From memory a garda may have to be in uniform before he can wave down a car but I would not contradict Deputy Noonan on that point. A question occurs to me and it is one I had not thought I would be raising this morning.  I am aware there has been controversy recently involving customs and excise officials in the country who were in a position to impose on-the-spot penalties in respect of people whom they found driving cars and with whom a cash transaction took place on the side of the road under threat of seizure.  I know there was some controversy about this matter and this power.  Apparently teams of Revenue officials around the country are coming to immediate arrangements with people.  Does the care and management provision set out in section 29 &mdash; which we have not yet reached &mdash; extend to the right of vehicle registration tax officers of the Revenue Commissioners to arrive at immediate compromises with people. The reason I raise this matter is that in another context it has been the subject of controversy.  Allegations were made that some officers took kick-backs or made soft settlements for cash with people.  It is very undesirable that teams should be roaming around the countryside making on-the-spot cash transactions with people, as part of the care and management provision which exposes individual officers to temptations that such procedures could create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, in that regard customs officers can come to a settlement but the individual has the right to refuse the settlement and that has always been the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In those circumstances the car is seized.  It is most undesirable that teams of people can go around the country and reach cash settlements with people about their cars.  I am <Col N="331" /> in favour of simple, practical solutions but I am opposed to the idea of three people flagging down a car or finding your car in a pub carpark, telling you that unless you give them £500 on the spot they will take the car away, and issuing a receipt for such money.  Those are circumstances in which corruption charges will be made and the temptation to be corrupt will be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That position has always existed.  The quick settlement is based on a formula and it is not arbitrary.  I accept the Deputy's point that somebody may get greedy; I cannot answer for everybody who is on the road.  The reason for the quick settlement is to try to avoid the position of garages and warehouses becoming totally clogged up in the system.  As I said earlier to Deputy Noonan, there is no question of Customs officers or Revenue officers in plain clothes stopping vehicles.  Deputy Noonan has a point in saying that the issuing of a letter does not exactly solve the problem.  To avoid confusion I will ensure that a regulation is brought before the House stating precisely how this will operate.</P>

This power is being <Col N="333" /> taken to enable the new Government to make whatever changes it feels necessary to the taxation arrangements of life assurance companies in collective investment undertakings.  Unlike the other taxes which apply to these investments, as I said this morning the levy is an upfront charge on the money invested.  Therefore, it cannot easily be abolished retrospectively. This section will enable the new Government to indicate, by way of statement, the changes it intends to make in this area.  The levy can then be abolished by order and the other necessary changes can be introduced retrospectively in the 1993 Finance Bill.</P>

Will the Minister outline the intentions in respect of bringing this section into operation?  Will it be introduced as part of the package with the equity fund and so on?

As the Deputy knows, much negotiation took place on the terms of the full package and I would very much like to have included it in this legislation. Companies dealing with pensions, the insurance industry, people in the stock market, the banking world and others were involved in the discussions.  There are some major proposals in the package and it is a matter for the new Government to change it if it wishes.</P>

All I am saying is that the 3 per cent levy for the insurance industry will be abolished on whatever day the Government decides to implement the new package.  If that is 1 February, so be it.  All the other changes will be implemented retrospectively in the Finance Bill.  Because the 3 per cent levy is paid upfront, next May when the debate on the 1993 Finance Bill has been concluded in the House we would be trying to collect the 3 per cent paid to the hundreds of agents around the country. It would be totally unreasonable on the insurance industry to do that.  I agree the decision should be taken sooner rather than later.  In normal times the decision would have been made by now and the Bill would have been passed by the House so that it would be ready to be enacted by 1 January.

The point I am making is that since the beginning of the year the insurance industry has been extremely worried about distortions that will occur in the savings market once the new arrangements in regard to the DIRT tax are brought in on 1 January.  In the autumn, after negotiations, the Minister brought out a package which went, depending on who one was talking to, some distance towards meeting their concerns and fears.  The Minister is now saying that everything can be done retrospectively in relation to the insurance industry except the 3 per cent levy.  Does he envisage a situation where the insurance industry could proceed during the first week in January with putting in place the special equity funds and the incoming Government would give retrospective legal status to those funds?</P>

      <P>Yes, providing the incoming Government makes that decision.  I would like to have brought forward the full proposals in November. I would prefer those proposals to be implemented sooner rather than later, and certainly not at the time of the 1993 Finance Bill.  As soon as the Government makes its decision, say, on 1 February, the Minister for Finance would by order allow the abolition of the 3 per cent levy and all the other matters outlined in the White Paper of 13 November, as amended by the new Government, would be enacted and retrospectively approved in the 1993 Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I raised a question about the intention of the Revenue Commissioners to maintain teams of inspectors roaming around the country looking for breaches of the Act.  I presume that <Col N="336" /> will continue.  I suggest that some proper procedure be put in place to ensure that there are no accusations of misbehaviour where Revenue officials confront a car owner who is suspected of breaching the Act.  I would ask the Minister to outline how he sees the abolition of border controls operating.  Will there be literally nobody at the port of Rosslare when a car drives off the boat?  Will there be a Garda checkpoint?  Will people be employed to record the numbers coming off the boat or will there be a complete right of free penetration into Ireland until one mets a checkpoint or something of that sort?</P>

      <P>It is outlined in detail. With the exception of security arrangements mainly related to drugs, there will be nobody.  All the existing staff of 600 people have been redeployed, some into totally unrelated customs areas, others into vehicle registration and sections dealing with international statistics. More people will be involved in carrying out checks in order to protect the revenue base.  I see the validity in the Deputy's questions.  If there are not to be customs officials and we have to protect revenue through the vehicle registration tax, more people will have to be involved in carrying out checks around the countryside. This cannot be done at Rosslare but there will be spotchecks throughout the country. There are new arrangements for security.  This week the Revenue Commissioners are to announce some new proposals in relation to criminal aspects.</P>

This aspect of the Single Market was a contentious issue because we did not want <Col N="337" /> some customs officers to claim they suspected everyone of carrying drugs.  There is a limited check.  The normal controls have been removed, including the green and red channels with which we are all familiar.  The paperwork has been eliminated. The arrangement is entirely new, but there is a security context involving the Department of Justice.  I will arrange for a note to be sent to Deputy M. McDowell in relation to this matter. There is some provision with regard to drugs.</P>

Ten years ago I remember driving across borders on the Continent and certainly on lesser roads there was no check.  Sometimes there was a hut but usually it was not manned after 5 o'clock.  The frontier now will be a European one.  I presume the check on people or vehicles from third countries will occur only when they first cross the EC frontier.  For traffic from Eastern Europe that would be somewhere along the German-Polish border, rather than Rosslare.  The only third country traffic at Rosslare would be from the United States or Scandinavia, not from within the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great satisfaction that I report to the House on the European Council in Edinburgh on 11-12 December where Ireland was represented by myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, also in attendance.  I had the Presidency Conclusions of the meeting laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas last Monday.</P>
      <P>Edinburgh was a major success both for Ireland and the Community.  EC funding for Ireland at a high level is now assured to the end of the century.  With a resolution of the Danish problem, the Maastricht Treaty is back on the rails, giving a much needed boost to confidence. Negotiations on enlargement can now begin.  The issues of subsidiarity and transparency have been ironed out. Other measures were agreed to boost investment and employment in the Community. For Ireland, the most important issue was the question of Community financing up to the end of the century and the proportion of this which would be allocated to us by way of the Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise here the crucial importance of these Funds to the whole idea of the Community.  You cannot have integration without regional redistribution. You cannot have true union without balanced development of the different parts of the Community.  It is vital to the future of the Community and its hopes for enlargement to include the other democracies of our continent, that this process of integration should proceed rapidly along with enlargement.  Deepening is as important a Community objective as widening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intensive preparations for the Edinburgh Council went on for several months before the Council, at the level of personal representatives of Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers.  I personally met with the British and Spanish Prime Ministers, and the German <Col N="340" /> Chancellor in Bonn.  I also sent a number of written communications on structural funding and on my wish to see a growth initiative agreed at Edinburgh, to Prime Minister Major and Commission President Delors.</P>
    <P>I am happy to inform the House that these contacts, together with a firm and carefully calculated stragegy and, not least, energetic participation in the Edinburgh meeting itself, have led to what is one of the greatest negotiating successes ever by an Irish Government.  Great benefits for Ireland will result from the agreement on Community financing up to the end of the century and especially on the resources to be provided for the Structural Funds and for the new Cohesion Fund over the period 1993-99.</P>
    <P>During the course of the referendum campaign earlier this year on the Maastricht Treaty, I said that our objective was to obtain about IR£6 billion over the five years to 1997, as implied by the original Commission proposals.  Many people accused me of raising unreal expectations.  From the Maastricht referendum campaign right through to the recent election the issue was used to denigrate my credibility.  Deputy Bruton on 6 May last in this House accused me of making wild promises and of presenting the £6 billion as a bribe from the European fairy godmother.  Deputy De Rossa on 23 October claimed the £6 billion was always an exaggeration and spoke of a &ldquo;sorry saga of dishonesty, particularly during the referendum campaign, and plain wrong-headed negotiating tactics and objectives&rdquo;.  Much of this was echoed in the media.  For instance, in the current December issue of &ldquo;Fortnight&rdquo; magazine, one of our superior commentators writes of &ldquo;the infamous £6 billion&rdquo; receding into the mists.  My strategy and my negotiating tactics have been vindicated.</P>
    <P>The agreement now reached ensures &mdash; and I say this with complete confidence &mdash; that Ireland will obtain in excess of IR£8 billion over seven years.  This will comprise up to IR£1 billion from the new cohesion fund and more than IR£7 billion from the Structural Funds.  A great deal will depend on how well we use this massive <Col N="341" /> supplement to our national resources; but it is beyond question that our country is offered an immense opportunity to raise investment and growth, improve our infrastructure and economic efficiency, and tackle the jobs crisis, further narrowing the gap between living standards here and the Community average.</P>
    <P>As part of the agreement, the eastern Laender of Germany and East Berlin will be classified as Objective 1 regions.  The development needs of these regions are immense.  The Edinburgh Conclusions make it clear that the allocations for Objective 1 regions, together with those for the Cohesion Fund, ensure that, even after allowing for full Objective 1 treatment for the new German territories, the four Cohesion Fund countries will be able to obtain a doubling of commitments between 1992 and 1999.</P>
    <P>This remarkably satisfactory outcome is ensured by the fact that, at Edinburgh, it was accepted that the total resources for the Cohesion Fund should be 15,150 million ECU, above the revised Commission proposal for 15 billion and well above the 12.5 billion proposed in the first Presidency compromise of 25 November. That Fund is part of the Maastricht Treaty, but the Edinburgh Conclusions provide, pending its ratification, for adoption before 1 April of an interim instrument based on Article 235 of the present Treaty.  This gives effect to a proposal by Ireland, first raised when I met Prime Minister González in Madrid on 25 September.</P>
    <P>The Community will finance up to 85 per cent of project cost under the Cohesion Fund, thus greatly reducing the need for matching finance from the Exchequer or elsewhere.  This will also ensure that we can substantially increase total expenditure on economic development, while making steady progress in reducing the debt-GNP ratio and meeting other requirements of economic and monetary union.  An agreement that greater account will be taken of national prosperity in deciding on Community cofinancing rates should lead to wider resort to the maximum intervention rate of 75 <Col N="342" /> per cent under the Structural Funds, with similar benefit to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion Fund will provide financial support for projects in the field of environment and in the area of transport infrastructure, including ports and airports. The fund will help finance the considerable expenditure necessary to ensure compliance with existing EC environment directives.</P>
    <P>Ireland's indicative allocation under the Cohesion Fund has been set at 7-10 per cent which compares favourably with our 7.5 per cent indicative allocation under the Regional Fund for the period 1989-93.  The Cohesion Fund allocations are to be based on certain specified criteria. Those include deficiency in transport infrastructure, which is very relevant to Ireland given the severe disadvantages that Ireland suffers as an island on the edge of Europe.</P>
    <P>The widespread recognition that we have used the existing funds in an effective way has been a powerful element in persuading our partners of the legitmacy of our arguments for future resources. This recognition has been expressed by State Secretary Koehler in Germany, by Commission President Delors and VicePresident Bangemann and indeed in the Commission's mid-term review of the 1988 reform of the funds.  The expenditure co-financed under the CSF has added an average of 0.5 per cent to the growth rate each year of the programme and, combined with the Government's sound economic policy, has helped to raise Ireland's GDP per head rising from 63 per cent of the Community average in 1988 to 69 per cent in 1991.</P>
    <P>The allocations for the various regions under the Structural Funds will be settled later on the basis of the Edinburgh Conclusions. These provide that full account should be taken, as of now, of national prosperity, regional prosperity, population of the regions and the relative severity of structural problems.  At my suggestion, the level of unemployment and the needs of rural development will specifically be taken into account.  These criteria broadly determined our current share of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> I should mention with satisfaction that Northern Ireland will continue to be classified as an Objective 1 region.  It is also of interest in the context of North-South economic co-operation in Ireland that Community initiatives, for which 5-10 per cent of the total Structural Fund resources are to be allocated are to mainly promote cross-Border and interregional co-operation, so that we are likely to see a new INTERREG Programme.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the main features of an agreement on structural funding which exceeded the expectations of all outside commentators, but which I always believed was within our capacity to achieve.  I certainly do not claim that all the credit is mine.  Much is due to the vision and tenacity of Commission President, Jacques Delors and to our Mediterranean allies, but I think it is fair to say that our own efforts, particularly with Germany, also made a decisive contribution. Here I want to pay tribute to Chancellor Kohl, who at Edinburgh delivered on his 1990 undertaking that German unification under a European roof would not be at the expense of the less prosperous member states.</P>
    <P>The agreement on structural funding formed part of a wider settlement on the future financing of the Community.  The current own resources ceiling of 1.2 per cent of Community GNP will be unchanged in 1993 and 1994 and then rise steadily to 1.27 per cent in 1999.</P>
    <P>The settlement ensures, in particular, that there will be enough resources to finance the Common Agricultural Policy, including the compensation payments agreed as part of the Common Agricultural Policy reform.  It was agreed at the Council that if agricultural spending were to exceed the guideline and thus compromise funding of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy, appropriate steps to increase the resources for FEOGA guarantee will be taken by the Council and the necessary money provided.</P>
    <P>On the resources side of the budget, the Edinburgh agreement gives effect to <Col N="344" /> the decisions in Maastricht and Lisbon that the regressive nature of the present system of contribution to the budget by member states would be corrected.  The VAT rate will be reduced from 1.4 per cent to 1 per cent in equal steps over the years 1995-99, thus making more of the financing on to the proportional GNP-related resource.  For the four cohesion countries, the limit on their VAT base as a percentage of GNP, will be cut to 50 per cent from 1995, as compared with 55 per cent now.  These welcome changes will reduce Ireland's contribution by about IR£15 million a year.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland strongly favour enlargement. It will bring several prosperous countries, with a long history of democracy, distinctive national cultures, and an honourable tradition of enlightenment into the Community.  These countries are also smaller countries and have similar foreign policy traditions to those of Ireland.</P>
    <P>However, we wished to see the deepening of the Community proceed in parallel with its widening.  As the Delors II package was the means for the Community to match its ambitions, we firmly adhered to the position, in the run-up to Edinburgh and at the meeting there, that the opening of enlargement negotiations must be preceded by agreement on future financing.</P>
    <P>With the agreements reached in the Council on the Danish problem and on the Delors II package, the way was clear for a green light for enlargement, subject to important safeguards for the Community.</P>
    <P>Negotiations will start with Austria, Sweden and Finland at the beginning of 1993, with Norway catching up as soon as the Commission opinion on its application is available.  The negotiations can only be concluded when the Treaty has been ratified by all 12 member states. Accession conditions will be based on acceptance in full of the Maastricht Treaty and what the Community has achieved, subject to transitional measures.</P>
    <P>We asked the Commission in preparing its still outstanding opinion on Switzerland's  <Col N="345" /> accession application to take into account the views of the Swiss authorities following the result of the referendum on the EEA agreement on 6 December.  We all regret but respect the Swiss decision, but the intention is to proceed with the EEA agreement with the remaining 18 countries.</P>
    <P>One of the central issues facing the Council was the Danish situation following the &ldquo;No&rdquo; result in the referendum there last June.  Ireland's approach to the issues involved was governed by two principles.  First, we were anxious to provide every possible support to the Danish Government in arriving at a solution which would enable it to put a positive recommendation to the Danish people that Denmark should ratify the Treaty on European Union.  Secondly, we were adamant that whatever solution was arrived at for Denmark it should not involve any changes to the Maastricht Treaty and thereby require a second ratification in other member states and in Ireland's case, a further referendum.</P>
    <P>On the issues raised by Denmark, we reached an agreement which satisfied the Danish Government and which has subsequently been endorsed by the seven political parties to the Danish national compromise.  This gives grounds for confidence that the agreement will create the basis for the Community to develop together, following a positive result in a further referendum which the Danish Government has undertaken to organise, by April or May next.</P>
    <P>At the same time, all of the points of concern to Ireland have been satisfactorily dealt with.  The European Council's set of arrangements for Denmark are fully compatible with the Treaty.  They clarify various aspects of the Treaty, but neither involve nor require any revision of it, a position confirmed at Edinburgh by the legal adviser to the Council.  No change is necessary in our Constitution, and advice from the Attorney General confirms this.</P>
    <P>On defence, the arrangements relate entirely to Denmark's position in relation to the Western European Union, a position which is the same as Ireland's.  The <Col N="346" /> Maastricht Treaty stipulates that the elaboration and implementation of decisions and actions with defence implications is for the Western European Union.  We, like Denmark, will be observers at the Western European Union.  Denmark will not be a member of the Western European Union, and neither will Ireland, Like Denmark, we will not be involved in the implementation of military or defence matters in the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The question of a future defence policy is a matter for separate negotiations in 1996, and the outcome of any such negotiations will require the approval of all member states, including Ireland and Denmark.  I have also undertaken to put the outcome of any future negotiations on defence policy to the Irish people in another referendum.  In the meantime, the specific character of Ireland's security policy is protected under the Maastricht Treaty.  In substance, Ireland is not subject to any obligation from which Denmark has been exempted.</P>
    <P>Subsidiarity and the related question of openness/transparency were issues which were discussed at the European Council in Birmingham last October.  Since then the Foreign Ministers completed a report setting out an overall approach to the application of the principle.  An annex to the Edinburgh conclusions sets out the basic principles to be adopted as well as guidelines, procedures and practices. The document specifically states that implementation of Article 3B shall not affect the balance between the institutions; that the principle cannot call into question the powers conferred on the Community by the Treaty as interpreted by the Court of Justice; and its application shall respect full maintenance of what the Community has achieved.</P>
    <P>The President of the Commission reported to the Council on the first results of the Commission's review of existing and proposed legislation in the light of the subsidiarity principle.  Examples of this review are set out in an annex to the Council conclusions.  The Council noted the Commission's intention to withdraw or amend certain proposals and to make <Col N="347" /> proposals for the amendment of items of existing legislation.  The Commission is taking a sensible, balanced course, and there is no question of any significant rolling back of Community competence or action in important areas.</P>
    <P>As regards openness and transparency, the European Council reaffirmed its commitment to a more open Community and adopted a number of specific measures to that end, such as open debates on work programmes and on major initiatives of public interest, better background information on Council decisions, and greater efforts when drafting conclusions to make them understandable to the public. Practicable steps will be taken to improve the quality of Community legislation and a speedier and a more organised use of consolidation or codification of such legislation will be pursued.</P>
    <P>The European Council also welcomed the measures the Commission has recently decided to take in the field of transparency.  These include producing the annual work programme in October to allow for wider debate including in national parliaments; seeking closer consultation with the Council on the annual legislative programme; and wider consultation before making proposals, including the use of Green Papers.</P>
    <P>The agreement on subsidiary and transparency is a good balance, and should help to bring the Community closer to the citizen without inhibiting the capacity of the institutions to act.</P>
    <P>The Edinburgh meeting did not hold a substantive discussion on the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, following a full discussion at a joint Council of Foreign, Agriculture and Trade Ministers on 7 December and ahead of the Agriculture Council meeting yesterday.</P>
    <P>We welcome the resumption of negotiations in Geneva, reaffirmed our commitment to an early, comprehensive and balanced agreement, called on all the parties to complete the negotiations, and noted that the final package must be judged as a whole.  The Government want such an agreement, which could make a big contribution to boosting <Col N="348" /> world trade and ending recession in many countries.  The Government recognises the decisive progress towards it made by Commissioner MacSharry in the deal struck with the US &mdash; but we must fully safeguard the legitimate interests of our farm families.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall that, in reporting here on 23 October on the Birmingham Summit, I stressed the concern of people that the Community should, in the run-up to Edinburgh, effectively tackle such problems as growth, jobs and interest rates.  I said that the Government would continue to pursue the question of concerted action to help all countries break out of the prevailing economic difficulties. We did pursue the question in all the fora open to us, and I myself wrote to Prime Minister Major, requesting him to give this matter a high place on our Edinburgh agenda.</P>
    <P>Finance Ministers in Edinburgh agreed a worthwhile initiative, which was in turn endorsed by the European Council and which has the potential to help kick-start investment and growth in Europe, especially in conjunction with the investment programmes that will flow from the agreed Delors II package.  The plan of action we agreed involves two elements &mdash; co-ordinating national policies within an agreed framework and supplementing this with Community credit lines.  In regard to national action, we agreed that member states should take every opportunity, according to their national circumstances, to exploit the limited margins of manoeuvre available as regards budgetary policy; and switch, to the extent possible, public expenditure priorities towards infrastructure and other capital investment and growthsuporting expenditures.  This is very much in line with the economic strategies that we would intend to pursue as a Government.</P>
    <P>The Community-level measures include establishment of a new temporary loan facility of IR£3.75 billion within the European Investment Bank to accelerate the financing of capital infrastructure projects, notably connected with trans-European networks; for projects <Col N="349" /> financed from the facility the EIB is invited to raise the normal ceiling on loans from 50 to 75 per cent and the ceiling for loans and grants combined from 70 to 90 per cent; and speedy action by the ECOFIN Council and the EIB to set up a European Investment Fund with 2 billion ECU capital, able to give guarantees to support up to IR$15 billion of projects.  These and other actions in the plan could provide Community support for investment in the public and private sectors of the member states amounting to more than IR£22 plus billion over the next few years.  To this must be added the much greater investments that will be levered by the Cohesion and Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>These agreements should give a fillip to business confidence and, together with the overall demonstration of solidarity within the Community at Edinburgh, help to calm foreign exchange markets and pave the way for lower interest rates. The Edinburgh meeting has again underlined the commitment of the member states to implementing the Maastricht Treaty on the basis of solidarity and co-operation. The exchange rate mechanism of the EMS is a central building block in that process, and the Government are satisfied that the full solidarity and resources of all participants are available to uphold the ERM in the face of unwarranted speculation.</P>
    <P>At the end of this month, the creation of the internal market will, in all essential respects, be successfully completed.  This is an historic moment for the Community, marking the fulfilment of one of the fundamental objectives of the Treaty of Rome.  Some 340 million consumers in the Community will, as a result, have more choice and lower prices.  We expressed confidence that the Single Market will boost job creation and sharpen the international competitiveness of business in Europe.</P>
    <P>For some time past there has been an inability to decide where new Communty bodies should be located.  This issue had become entangled with the long-standing controversy about the seats of the principal Community institutions.  In 1965, <Col N="350" /> there was a decision on provisional seats of the institutions, but not on their definitive location.  The present locations of the Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Court, the European Investment bank and the European Court of Auditors were definitively agreed in Edinburgh.  Ireland will continue to pursue its case for the siting of at least one of the new bodies here, preferably the new medicines agency.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to Declaration No. 15 to the Maastricht Treaty, the European Council also agreed on the basis of the proposal of the European Parliament to increase the size of the Parliament to 567 members.  This decision will take effect from 1994, and is intended to reflect German unification and is in the perspective of the eventual enlargement of the Community.  Germany obtains an extra 18 seats, with <i>pro-rata</i> increases for other member states whose population and level of existing representation justify this.  Ireland's allocation of seats remains unchanged at 15, as does that of Denmark and Luxembourg.  All three countries have a representation double that of Germany's relative to population.</P>
    <P>A declaration on the tragedy in former Yugoslavia focuses on the responsibility of the present leadership of Serbia and of the Bosnian Serbs for the savage acts which continue to take place.  The European Council agreed a separate declaration on the systematic detention and rape of Muslim women in Bosnia.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, strongly supported this German initiative when it was discussed among Foreign Ministers, and he was instrumental in having these unspeakable acts designated as crimes against humanity.  He was requested by the European Council at the suggestion of the German Foreign Minister and in the light of his record on human rights issues to act as political head of an EC delegation which will investigate the detention camps and report urgently to the Foreign Ministers.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the European Council on Africa emphasises the Community's readiness to provide economic <Col N="351" /> assistance and to lend support to political processes aimed at ending conflicts, and in South Africa, at proceeding to a transitional government and fully democratic elections.  The European Council expressed its full support for the recent Security Council resolution authorising measures to provide a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia.  At Ireland's suggestion, the importance of ensuring the safety of relief personnel was underlined.</P>
    <P>The success at Edinburgh owes a lot to the ability of Prime Minister John Major to develop good relations and understanding with all his colleagues and to his very skilful and determined chairmanship, qualities which, I have no doubt, will enable him to deliver British ratification of Maastricht within an acceptable period.  Our thanks are due to him, to Secretary of State Hurd and officials for the well-run Council they hosted in the beautiful city of Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>For the Community, the outcome of the Council is a considerable achievement, in reaching agreement on such a wide agenda of complex issues that were also interlocking.  Agreement on each was a prerequisite for a settlement on all. The Community is firmly back on the path to European Union.  For Ireland, the remarkably successful outcome opens up a vista of opportunity which we must now seize, first, by putting in place a stable Government with a clear developmental orientation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Dermot Nally, Secretary of the Government, who will be retiring shortly.  He has served this country with honour and distinction and has given invaluable service to successive Governments and Taoisigh in relation to many important, high level political negotiations.  I am sure I speak for all Members of this House, we would all like to thank him for his work and to wish him a happy and well deserved retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening my remarks I would like to join in the tribute <Col N="352" /> to Mr. Dermot Nally for the outstanding service he has given to the country.  In many ways we in this House fail to recognise and recall the outstanding efforts of our public servants who work in a dedicated way for our country without public recognition.  I am delighted to endorse the Taoiseach's remarks in relation to Mr. Dermot Nally, the retiring Secretary of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Edinburgh Summit could have been an unmitigated disaster &mdash; that was the outcome widely predicted in the media.  The fact that it was reasonably successful in relation to a number of issues has resulted in an atmosphere of euphoria being created by the same media.  Here at home that celebratory atmosphere has been further boosted by a most successful public relations campaign which has been swallowed hook, line and sinker by an uncritical media.</P>
      <P>At European level it was a bonus to have settled and agreed a response to the Danish problem in regard to the Maastricht Treaty, as also was the agreement on the financial perspectives of the Community up to 1999.  On the other hand, the most critical and urgent problem facing the Community was not even addressed.  Seven weeks prior to the Edinburgh Summit, a special summit was convened in the wake of the monetary earthquake that had seen the UK and Italy out of the ERM and other currencies, including our own, under intense pressure.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Birmingham Summit in October was to restore confidence and stability in the currency system.  The best that the Birmingham Summit could agree was an understanding that the financial turbulence called for reflection and analysis.  The conclusions of that summit stated:</P>
      <P>in the light of the increasing size and sophistication of capital markets, greater capital liberalisation and of developments in the European and World monetary systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem was then referred to Finance Ministers assisted by the monetary <Col N="353" /> committee and the EC Commission with the Central Bank governors &ldquo;to carry this work forward&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One would think from the conclusions of the Presidency in Edinburgh, and from the report of the Taoiseach, that the financial problems in the Community have been resolved whereas there was not even a discussion on the existence of the enormous monetary crisis which continues to overhang the Community.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to the GATT Uruguay Round the differences between member states were not even discussed apart from the usual bland presidency-type statement which reaffirmed a commitment to an early comprehensive and balanced agreement and called on all parties to complete negotiations accordingly. That is as far as it went and anybody who realises the importance of getting a successful conclusion to the GATT negotiations &mdash; a fair one which takes into account the problems being experienced by people on family farms &mdash; must blink at the thought that there was no detailed discussion on that issue. Therefore, any suggestion that the Edinburgh Summit changed from being an unmitigated disaster &mdash; which was predicted a week prior to the summit &mdash; to an enormous success on all fronts is not correct.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from the very impressive media presentation by the Taoiseach that all our troubles were resolved forever as a result of the Edinburgh Summit.  I do not wish to detract in any way from the efforts of the Taoiseach and his advisers at the Edinburgh meeting. They were correct to solidly support the campaign led by Spanish Premier González.  It was a good move to stick close to him all the way and the result from the point of view of the overall financial package was very good.  It takes some neck for the Taoiseach to come in here and state, with false modesty, &ldquo;I certainly do not claim that all the credit is mine&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach must think that we all came down in the last shower. Everybody knows what happened prior to the Edinburgh Summit.  In the run-up to the summit an objective magazine <i>The <Col N="354" /> Economist</i>&mdash; I do not know if the Taoiseach reads it &mdash; contained a comprehensive article setting out what might happen at the summit.  It referred to the insistence of the Spaniards to hold up agreement on any issue unless the campaign they had launched in regard to the financial package was resolved.  In the light of the Taoiseach's report to this House, and his earlier media presentation, it is unusual that there was no reference in <i>The Economist</i> to the efforts of Ireland or of the Taoiseach to ensure that there would be a fair and proper resolution of the financial and budgetary problems affecting the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has had his chance and time is running out for him.  I did not interrupt the Taoiseach in his contribution but, perhaps, I have struck a raw nerve.  I will tell the truth. To convey to this country that £8 billion is available in extra money as a result of the Herculean efforts of the Taoiseach through his blood, sweat, toil and tears at the Edinburgh Summit is pure codology.</P>
      <P>We receive approximately £600 million a year from the Structural Funds.  At the time of the debate on the Maastricht Treaty we had before us the Commission proposals which involved a five year package worth about £6 billion.  The effect of this five year proposal is that the £600 million a year we receive would have doubled to approximately £1,200 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our share of the overall package <Col N="355" /> decided at Edinburgh is a sum which will probably work out at about £1 billion a year.  The real battle, which has not been referred to here, and when we will be on our own and in competition with the Spaniards, will be to ensure that our share of the overall funds is at the top end of the scale, the 10 per cent rather than 7 per cent of the Cohesion Funds and at least at the existing percentage or more of the Structural Funds.  We will not achieve a doubling of the sum we receive annually, but we will get a significant increase and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to oversell the result to date as, in effect, providing a crock of gold which will either resolve all our problems or be available for stroke politics. Despite the vast amounts of money we receive from the European Community we have succeeded in establishing the highest unemployment rate in the Community and, unfortunately, it is rising. What is important is that any additional funding made available over the next few years should be carefully spent to achieve the best results in terms of job creation in the short and medium term.</P>
    <P>To date the Government has refused to accept the principles of regional development which have brought such benefit to other countries.  What passes as an excuse here for a regional structure is essentially an extension of centralised bureaucracy.  In effect, we have only one regional development organisation, SFADCo in the mid-west region.  Local authority powers have never been developed and the authorities have no direct access to structural funding.</P>
    <P>The result is that we, the most centralised country in Europe with the weakest local authority base and virtually no regional structure may be unable to make any appreciable impact on reducing our unemployment figures even with increased structural funding.</P>
    <P>I am even more alarmed by newspaper reports of comments by members of the Fianna Fáil Party that the extra EC funding amounts to a crock of gold which they wish to keep their hands on.  God help the unemployed here if that is the attitude <Col N="356" /> in relation to funding genuinely made available by other member states of the Community with a view to reducing the disparities between the centre and peripheral areas such as Ireland.  In many ways the Taoiseach is like a leprechaun with a phoney crock of gold trying to reach the end of the rainbow.  Anyone taken in by this posturing should remember the re-election and retention in office of Richard Nixon who was head of the most scandal-ridden Administration in the United States in this century.  A committee was engaged in special activities on his behalf appropriately called &ldquo;CREEP&rdquo;&mdash; the committee for the re-election of the President.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the efforts of the outgoing discredited Administration here to cling on to office and the post-Edinburgh posturing of the Taoiseach on European funds, the best warning I can give to anyone taken in by such approaches is to beware of the &ldquo;CREEPS&rdquo; when they bring gifts.</P>
    <P>It is time we had a real debate about the European issues which we are concerned about rather than the superficial pork barrel type comment which passes for debate and analysis.  We should now be analysing why we have not been able to achieve a better result in terms of jobs from the vast sums of money, running into billions and billions of pounds, which we have already obtained through our membership of the European Community. We should also accept that the old formula of keeping not just the electorate but the legislators uninformed on European issues should end once and for all.</P>
    <P>Whatever Government emerges from the present negotiations and discussions must, as a first priority, immediately establish a foreign affairs committee so that Members of the Oireachtas will no longer be kept in the dark as to what is happening at EC level.  An effort must be made to have a much broader understanding among the general public of these issues.</P>
    <P>It is alarming that, in the survey prepared by Lansdowne Market Research, on behalf of the EC Commission by its <Col N="357" /> Dublin office launched yesterday, 44 per cent of those interviewed said that by the date of the Maastricht referendum last June they were only vaguely aware of the issues or did not know what the Treaty was about.  That is an appalling figure in a country where the referendum was considered to be of such importance and where, leading up to the referendum, such an effort was made in that short period to try to ensure that people understood the issues involved.</P>
    <P>If you look at the survey in more detail you will find that of the people who were asked &ldquo;By the date of the referendum how good was your understanding of the issues involved?&rdquo;, only 18 per cent indicated that they had a good understanding of the issues.  Even in the case of those who indicated they had an understanding, a majority said they understood some of the issues but not all.  An appalling figure of almost 50 per cent either did not know what the Treaty was about or were only vaguely aware of the issues. It is an indictment of our democratic system which will have to be resolved.</P>
    <P>It is of great importance to ensure that our people remain fully committed to the European ideal and they can only do that in the context of being fully informed on the issues.  It was pointed out in the report of the Institute for European Affairs which was published last week that the European Community faces a crisis of confidence.  Many external factors contributed to this &mdash; the end of the Soviet Empire leading to the emergence of a new security order in Europe, the challenges posed for the Community by the new demands of the Central and Eastern European States and the outbreak of ethnic and regional conflicts in many parts of Europe and the former Soviet Union.  Another reason is the world depression and the change in the policy of most EFTA countries towards membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>On the internal side there are equally numerous factors which are interrelated. The Maastricht Treaty was essentially a compromise between states with very different views of Europe; these differences emerged through the Danish rejection of the Treaty and significant <Col N="358" /> reservations in the United Kingdom. German unification was a consequence of the collapse of the Soviet empire but that set off a chain reaction which accelerated the consideration of political union.  In addition, it imposed unexpected financial burdens on the largest contributor to Community finances and, unfortunately, led to a high interest rate regime, to which I will refer in a moment, which affected other economies, not just Germany, and created the preconditions for the currency crisis.  This resulted in speculation against the weaker currencies and the forcing of sterling and the lira out of the ERM.</P>
    <P>I hope the Maastricht Treaty will be ratified by Denmark and, belatedly, by the United Kingdom.  However, I should like to know what thought or analysis has gone into the situation which would arise if the Maastricht Treaty is rejected and is not ratified by all 12 member states. There is nothing negotiated in the Treaty to cover this eventuality.  At a minimum there should be a discussion on the different options available in such an eventuality. This would not in any way take from the heartfelt concern of Europeans like myself who hope that the Treaty will be ratified.  Furthermore, it is clear that the uncertainty about the future of Maastricht and the possibility of some member states moving separately towards European Monetary Union have created a difficult policy context for a country such as ours.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the currency crisis has imposed costs in the economy and has had a very negative impact on jobs, competitiveness, living standards and public finances.  This requires immediate and decisive action on the grounds of solidarity on the part of the larger member states which anchor the ERM. Essentially, we need concrete measures in support of the smaller states in the narrow band.  I do not want to labour the point but I am appalled that this issue was not even raised or discussed in Edinburgh.  The serious currency problem has not been resolved and there are measures which could and should be taken at European level to stabilise the situation.  As far as I can see, the matter <Col N="359" /> was not even raised in Edinburgh.  This is very worrying in relation to the future of monetary stability in Europe.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any evidence either of discussions on interest rates which, in Ireland and elsewhere, must be brought down if jobs are to be created and the living standards of those on mortgages are to be restored.  This can only be done if there is European leadership with sufficient authority to force Germany to finance its budget deficit by taxation, not by borrowing; to accelerate the timetable for the establishment of the European Central Bank; to reach early agreement with the United States on world trade on terms which are fair and just; and to persuade Britain to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism at a more realistic exchange rate than that at which it became a member.  Realisation of these four measures would knock at least five points off present Irish interest and mortgage rates almost overnight.  All these things could be done if there was proper political leadership in Europe.  They cannot and will not be done unless, at the minimum, these issues are raised and discussed by those at present responsible for conducting our affairs of State.  We all have a responsibility to develop Ireland's role as a committed member state of the European Union.  We should make it clear that we are willing to shoulder our responsibilities while also insisting on due recognition of our peripheral location with a huge unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Ireland will play a full role in shaping the Europe of the future unless there is discussion on and an understanding of what that role should be.  I am absolutely clear that we must fight our corner to the best advantage in securing the best return from our membership of the European Union. However, the whole idea of a vision of Europe of the future will be debased if our total concentration is focused on the pork barrel aspect of our membership. The returns in every sense, including financial, would be far greater if we had a more determined and committed European approach in the way we deal with <Col N="360" /> European affairs.  Essentially my approach would involve a full commitment to a federal Europe while at the same time not forgetting that any such federal Europe would involve automatic transfer by way of equalising of wealth to peripheral regions such as ourselves.</P>
    <P>The approach I propose points to an essential difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  We want to see more fully developed and more democratic Community institution; we have pressed the case for the establishment of an EC Senate with equal representation from all member states.  I strongly urge the direct election of the President of the EC Commission. I do so on the basis of giving more democratic legitimacy to that institution. I believe also that we should open up a debate and establish a position that will enable us to contribute usefully to the next EC Inter-Governmental Conference on Security and Defence.  There has been no sense of direction given us from what the Taoiseach had to say in that regard.  These issues will have to be faced in the context of the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference on Security and Defence.  Now is the time to get the debate under way rather than have our people vote again in ignorance on a referendum after that conference.  As yet neither do we seem to have the self-confidence about our place and role in Europe to enable us talk about what we have to offer to Europe.  The fact that we are enormous beneficiaries in financial terms does not mean we have nothing to offer Europe.  We have our traditions, culture and approach which could make an impact on the development of European policies.  I have to say I totally reject the approach of those who would place our country in a kind of European limbo from which we could self-righteously proclaim our independent position while, at the same time, begging the members of that union to provide us with financial and other benefits of membership.</P>
    <P>I might make a brief comment on the question of the external relations of the Community.  The question must be raised as to whether we, as Europeans, are happy with the agreed Conclusions of <Col N="361" /> Edinburgh.  The ineffectiveness of the foreign policy of the EC sometimes to be demonstrated in the countries of the former Yugoslavia where tens of thousands of people continue to suffer from hunger, cold, and worse.  Stories of the treatment of Muslims, in particular of their women, are horrendous.  I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been asked to participate in a delegation to report on that issue.  I do not wish in any way to detract from that initiative but, in many ways, the European Council displays its ineffectiveness in its demands and I quote:</P>
    <P>that all the detention camps and in particular camps for women should be immediately closed.  Free and secure access must be given to humanitarian organisations so that all those detained in the camps can be assisted.</P>
    <P>That is a direct quotation from one of the annexes to the Conclusions of the Presidency.</P>
    <P>I do not point to the ineffectiveness of the EC on the basis that I disagree with these demands; of course I agree with them.  Its ineffectiveness arises because these demands have been, will continue to be ignored, and the European Community will do nothing about them.</P>
    <P>Essentially we had an EC summit in Edinburgh the results of which will be of benefit to Ireland, particularly if additional funding is wisely and properly spent.  We should be particularly thankful that in the lead-up to the summit Spain took such a strong stand in blocking progress on a wide range of issues unless and until they got satisfaction on their budget demands.  The Taoiseach was quite right to fully support the stand taken by Spain which will result in an increase of approximately two-thirds in the Structural Funds for Objective 1 areas, including Ireland, and the establishment of a substantial Cohesion Fund.  It would be very unwise to attempt to suggest that the Conclusions reached at Edinburgh have in any way resolved the enormous problems affecting the European Community or that those results in any way will constitute a magic formula for the <Col N="362" /> resolution of our problems, in particular that of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Assistance from Europe is welcome, but we will resolve our problems essentially through our own efforts.  Indeed, any attempt to delude ourselves to the contrary on the part of prospective Government partners or on the part of the general public, would be a selfdelusion.</P>
    <P>Normally an EC summit provides an opportunity for a bilateral meeting between the Taoiseach of the day and the British Prime Minister with a special focus on Northern Ireland.  I am very disappointed indeed, despite the pressures on the Presidency, that there was nothing contained in the report of the summit of such a meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. Normally we have such a report but, presumably since there was no such meeting, we do not have a report.  Nonetheless it is very important that we place on record our view of the position, of the continued urgency of action in relation to the circumstances prevailing in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Every Irish person of whatever tradition or allegiance feels diminished by our collective failure over the past 20 years to end the violence and achieve reconciliation in Northern Ireland and between the two traditions on the island. We must ask, how long more will this continue?  A total of 3,000 people have been killed already with thousands more maimed for life.  The employment prospects of the entire island suffer from the failure to find a resolution to this problem. It was estimated recently that upwards of 75,000 jobs would be created if the violence came to an end, when we could develop the economy of the island as a whole.  This will be achieved only if politicians on both sides of the Border are prepared to take risks for peace.  In coming years, with the development of European union and its institutions.  I hope the bitterness and sharpness of the differences may diminish leading to a growing acceptance of diversity in a broader European context.  In the meantime, there is an absolute need for all of <Col N="363" /> us to continue the search to find a formula that will end the violence and achieve reconciliation on terms acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Whatever Government may emerge from discussions taking place at present &mdash; which will continue over coming days &mdash; must seek an early resumption of talks on Northern Ireland.  Any such Government must also have the courage to take an initiative to ensure that such talks will not drag on inconclusively.  There must be a positive willingness to recommend changes to our Constitution as part of an overall settlement.  I predict that history will condemn those who do not have the courage to compromise.  In the meantime, the killing and violence will continue unless and until a fair and reasonable settlement has been agreed and achieved.</P>
    <P>While the results of the Edinburgh summit are a bit like the curate's egg, good in spots, I am happy with those parts of it that are positive and not happy with those parts that were either over-looked entirely or did not lead to positive results.  I mentioned I am particularly unhappy that there was no focus at all, by way of discussion on the margins of the summit, between the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister with regard to Northern Ireland.  I hope that opportunity will arise with a new Taoiseach in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I might comment on the procedure we are following, not by way of criticism of the specific activities of this afternoon.  I believe it was one of the failures of the 26th Dáil that we did not establish a foreign policy committee, with adequate terms of reference, of which I have been an advocate for a very long time; or a European affairs committee, with revised and extended terms of reference, that would enable us prepare for occasions such as EC summits with greater throughness and participation in terms of the options available to us.  It is very important that we take note of that aspect.  We can think of the mechanism such as that <Col N="364" /> available to us &mdash; and which may have been resorted to on one or two occasions when the Government of the day tabled a motion welcoming the conclusions of a summit &mdash; enabling a more interactive discussion rather than statements.  That meant, for example, that people who put questions that were not clearly answered in the final communiqué could have them answered by the Minister of the day.  That is a more satisfactory mechanism.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's statement this afternoon the first thing that must be said is that in relation to the Structural and Cohesion Funds the out-turn was better than had been expected. That should be welcomed in the context of a very difficult Presidency.  One of the freedoms of being a Member of Parliament is that one is able to comment on the Presidency of other countries.  On the occasion of the Irish Presidency I recall rather negative remarks having been made by some of our colleagues in Britain about our running of the Presidency, even before we had commenced, about our capacity to do so at all.  Objective commentators looking at the British Presidency will regard it as one which was not a well prepared one.  In my view it was a Presidency within which certain difficulties arose.  Let us be generous.  If, from the jaws of its conclusion, some successes have been snatched, let us note them but, more importantly, place them in context.</P>
      <P>In terms of media interest here the Taoiseach, perhaps correctly, stressed what will be the immediate impact of increased Cohesion and Structural Funds.  However, in what I have to say I should like not to begin at that point.  The Edinburgh Summit came at a moment for either regression or progress in the evolution of the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me immediately put to rest something that is very unfair in this House. When people speak from the perspective of a Europe of the peoples or from the perspective of an evolving Europe which is taking its place in an international community of nations, in which the European Community and its institutions will deal with the United Nations and with other <Col N="365" /> fora in which we discuss issues on trade, aid, development and so on, they are considered to be, somehow or other, vaguer Europeans.  That is the politest version.  I am not sure whom the previous speaker had in mind when he referred to those who would have us live in a European limbo while at the same time begging.  This kind of caricature does not serve anybody very well.  The reality is that there is room for difference about the future shape of Europe.</P>
    <P>With regard to what is called &ldquo;the Danish problem&rdquo; I would prefer to say that we are reacting and responding to the Danish decision.  If we enjoy the fruits of democracy within our own system we are obliged to respect the democratic decision of citizens in another country with whom we have friendly relations. There are consequences to the Danish decision which have been addressed at many meetings coming up to the Edinburgh Summit and at the Edinburgh Summit.  There were responses to the circumstances which arose in Denmark's relationship to the Community, circumstances which I am not interested in fudging.  One set of responses to the Danish decision was to leave Danish rights intact within some of the founding treaties of the European Community, while at the same time setting Denmark apart from future evolutionary proposals for the European Community.  There were those who erred by excess, who suggested that the rights available to Danish citizens should take second place to the evolutionary aspirations of the members who it was perceived were adopting an uncritical attitude with greater robustness.  I am in favour of a greater calm in these matters of foreign policy and diplomacy.  It brings a better result in the end.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects that are important.  I welcome such good decisions as have come from a difficult meeting and will benefit the Irish people. There is a bigger problem in the European Community around which future presidencies will no longer be able to flurry and just indulge in rhetoric.  When we hear phrases such as &ldquo;democratic <Col N="366" /> deficit&rdquo; and remarks about transparency, we are really exchanging code words with those people who at a certain level of Community involvement have perceived a great alienation among the peoples of Europe from the European process.  I do not say that I welcome that.  I am simply saying that by putting a name on it and then proceeding to talk again and again of the democratic deficit or transparency we are not solving the problem.  The problem is a deeper one and it needs a deeper response than that.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental distinction between a Europe of the peoples and a Europe of markets, integrated monetary arrangements and fiscal policies.  The differences are not irreconcilable, but where the philosophical issue arises is the order in which one places them.  Certainly, many of the parties advocated an uncritical approach towards the European Community and argued that we really should accept the greater speed and precision which was manifest in Maastricht in relation to everything economic and monetary.  Those who accepted this order of things were regarded as good Europeans, whereas those who went in the reverse order and spoke of social Europe, a Europe of the peoples, were somehow or other lesser Europeans.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speaker that the greatest problem facing Europe is that of unemployment.  It is an even greater problem here.  There is a sense in which that problem is combined with others that were addressed in Edinburgh. One should try to be historically accurate about how these emphases come to be. When the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated it was at the time of what one might call the great hubris of Von Hayek's ideas about individualism had been popularised by Friedmann and others and has been used in a vulgar sense by Thatcher and Reagan.  This ethos in which the Treaty was negotiated had certain precise assumptions associated with it, which will long be remembered from those remarkable phrases by Mrs. Thatcher &mdash; now Lady Thatcher &mdash; in her day, in which she said that there is no such thing as society.  The idea was that having broken <Col N="367" /> down societies into their individual components &mdash; selfish, aspirational, greedy self advancements &mdash; one could then put all these bits and pieces together and get an economically viable entity and somehow or other when this has been completed one could turn one's face to those people who were unemployed, to those who had lost jobs and to the manufacturing industry which had been destroyed.</P>
    <P>As bodies were left in the field after this great battle that took place &mdash; it was not the left that was attacked; they were regarded very often as not being entitled to have an opinion at all &mdash; there were Keynsians everywhere, neo-Keynsian corpses littering the field in economics. They had been run from institutes and so on.  Therefore, it was with particular interest that I read of the appointment to the seven-person group who are advising Mr. Lamont in the Treasury, of Professor Godley.  Professor Godley's work has been interesting for a very long time, not least because he had a penchant for making predictions and those predictions happened to be right very often.  He spoke for example, of how the unemployment rate would rise in Britain.  He suggested in 1982 that unemployment could reach four million.  It went past three million.  It is interesting that in his article in the <i>Guardian</i> of five days ago, Peter Marsh said of Professor Godley:</P>
    <P>He rejects free-market Thatcherite economics as both unjust and giving the wrong picture of how economies work.  He says the most important part of modern economies is not millions of people working as free agents but institutions such as governments, companies, banks and trade unions which operate in a number of unique ways and cannot be fitted into &ldquo;dangerous and pernicious&rdquo; theories about free choice.</P>
    <P>Now that Professor Godley, heretic, has been given the ear of the Treasury in Britain, one may expect changes in economic policy, unless he is being hired for <Col N="368" /> vicarious pleasure.  Among the changes that will take place will be changes in interest rates, possibly further devaluations, changes in relation to the ERM and so on.  I make this point only to say that Maastricht is a creature of its time, of its sets of economic assumptions and of the relationship between economic indicators and social indicators.  Equally, if there is to be an evolution in Europe, we will see further changes.  It may be, and I agree with the previous speaker, that Edinburgh did not recognise the full extent of unemployment, but there is no doubt that future presidencies will have to engage the unemployment problem. This will involve gradually seeking a return of many different and new strategies for priming growth, for redefining employment, for creating greater activity for income distribution.</P>
    <P>The weakest part of the Taoiseach's speech was that concerning the joint declarations. He mentioned that the two measures indicated in relation to stimulating a recovery in European growth are the availability of increased levels of funding and co-ordinated strategies. What I understand the peoples of Europe to want is to have those strategies made specific.  What is there to co-ordinate? Let us be honest about this.</P>
    <P>The old assumptions, this hegemony of a certain very narrow and very dated view of the relationship between economy and society has nearly destroyed human Europe.  It has left across the face of Europe a tragically high level of unemployment, bringing with it all the social consequences.  There is no point in parties turning around and saying in the middle of such a massive structural impact that what we need is to restore the impulse to work.  Are we to give lectures on motivation to work to the millions who are out of work?  Millions of people are desperately seeking to become active and millions of people looked on and recognised a shift in the whole emphasis of economic policy in the direction of speculation as opposed to production.  People from many countries in Europe who would be on the opposite side of the political spectrum from me <Col N="369" /> and with whom I have spoken, have talked of the difficulty of sustaining even the idea of there being a manufacturing component in the productive economy. The productive economy was dislodged as a desirable place even to seek employment by those who were advocating the theology of speculation.  It is an old and dreary time in Europe from which we will all detoxify ourselves.  Even those who are trained in economics and the social sciences will begin to think in human terms again.  I have to say that, because I think it is important not just to say that the unemployment problem is neglected. There are two specifics I wish to mention. I doubt whether there is a capacity in the Community to sufficiently realise, at ministerial meetings and meetings of heads of State level, the crisis of language there is in Europe, which is only in turn reflecting a deeper philosophical crisis and an absolutely bankrupt set of economic assumptions.  If we are to rescue the best of Maastricht the best of European evolution, moving towards a European Community, there must be implemented a significant shift in values.  That shift in values will have to come and it is only when that happens that the unemployment problem will move to the top of the agenda.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred, too, to accession.  A few months ago I had the pleasure of being in Finland and meeting the Finnish European committee and people who had for a long time been working on and writing about Finland's relationship with the European Community. Certainly if the Finns, in accession talks, want to lay emphasis on the concept that the unemployment rate in a particular country not be allowed to depart beyond a certain margin from the average rate without there being taken immediately a series of corrective measures in relation to finance and to additional funding, Ireland should support that.  The experience of Finland is interesting, moving within 18 months from an unemployment rate of 3 per cent to one of more than 13 per cent.  That has been a dramatic shift within Finland itself.  The question of unemployment <Col N="370" /> there is a big element and will be a big element when the accession debate starts in Finland.  This is an aspect of the enlargement process that we should examine and to which we should lend some support.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the somewhat tedious business of money.  The Structural and the Cohesion Funds do affect employment and jobs.  It is not a matter of taking from the Community, but I shall return to that point in a moment.  One is no less Communitaire because one is in receipt of funds that propose to level up European incomes.  Incomes have been raised by a small 4 per cent to 5 per cent to be somewhat less than 70 per cent of the Community average at present.  There should be consensus on the issue of increased funds.  The mechanism of spending those funds should be accountable and productive.  Evidence shows that between 1989 and 1993 the funds we used did not close gaps within regions.  For example, employment has fallen by 2 per cent in the eastern part of this county and by 6 per cent in the west, the west having had a higher rate of unemployment and a higher rate of emigration.  I do not wish to set up a tension between the regions, I am simply saying that the way in which the funds were spent did not achieve a reduction in regional disparities and it did not have the impact on the unemployment problems that it should have had.  One could refer to the funding that found its way to the agricultural sector. Eighty per cent of the funding found its way to the top 20 per cent of agricultural producers.  One could say that the funding got swallowed into an agricultural sector rather than being broadly dispersed within an agricultural community. Both the regional allocation and the funding in agriculture had defined consumer consequences in the way in which the funding flowed through by the multiplier in the different areas.</P>
    <P>Lest people say that unemployment can be easily answered by achieving an increase in the Structural and Cohesion Funds &mdash; as the Taoiseach sometimes seemed to suggest &mdash; I would point out that in 1989 our unemployment rate was <Col N="371" /> 17.9 per cent, when the average in the European Community was 9 per cent, and now, as we come to the end of 1992, Irish unemployment stands at 22 per cent while the average rate in the European Community is 9.5 per cent.  Increased funding is not an automatic answer to the Irish unemployment problem and if the increased funding is to reduce disparities and be of assistance it must be focused in a way that previous funding was not.  If regional structures are to be set up we must make sure that it is done within a genuine regional policy.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I was one of the founders of the Regional Studies Association in Ireland.  I remember the early papers that were presented.  Those papers stressed the importance of a democratic base to the regional structures and of allowing within those democratic structures the possibility of setting up plans, allocating budgets to them and monitoring and implementing them according to targets that were accountable.  It is a disgrace that we have not had that.  There is also a necessity for transparency in the way in which the funding is spent.  We need to get rid of the dead hand of orthodoxy, of everything having to be submitted, which has the result that people do not know whether a payment is a substitute for normal funding or something innovative within a regional structure.  An anti-unemployment strategy can be combined with regional structure by involving people.  In that way one can participate in creating wealth.</P>

      <P>I should have liked to raise many other matters.  For example, I hope that when the new Government is appointed we will have an opportunity to discuss in a more accountable way our relationship with Western European Union.  I welcome the indication in the Taoiseach's speech that a referendum will be held before we enter any commitments <Col N="372" /> of a military kind.  The Western European Union will itself be redrafted in terms of structure in the nineties.  I deplore that we have moved from a casual observer to a permanent observer attendance without an opportunity to discuss this matter in the Dáil or to seek a mandate from the people to do so.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a related matter.  On pages 48 and 49 of the document from the Edinburgh Summit there is a reference to migrants.  This is an issue on which the Community is tested.  It is interesting to note that all the earlier paragraphs on page 48 refer to the difficulties which migrants create for receiving countries.  The second half of the page makes an outright condemnation of racism and zenophobia.  A charter of rights for migrants will be a testing point for the Community and is a matter of great urgency.  The combination of migrant inflows and high unemployment where people are often deprived of participation in their own society is a recipe for disaster.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the idea of Europe in the wider world and particularly to Yugoslavia and Africa.  I endorse everything that has been said about Yugoslavia and the necessity to achieve peace in Bosnia.  I do not intend going over the same ground but I do raise a question about those who pressed so hard for recognition at a time when the mechanisms were not in place for dealing with tensions which could have been anticipated, and we will have to look at that in the future.  We should never make these mistakes again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I paid tribute to the activities of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, in relation to Somalia but more is needed.  When I was in Somalia the European Community was disgraced by not being represented in Mogadishu.  I think it was seeking to be represented in Nairobi while I was there but that was not where the conflict was.  I was delighted our Minister for Foreign Affairs and our President visited that area.  This paragraph on Africa is markedly bare.  It does not address such issues as food, security, the Horn of Africa, or <Col N="373" /> initiatives for restoring civil society in Somalia which is important, nor does it make adequate reference to the issues of aid, trade and debt.  When it does look at the relationship to GATT, sadly, it does not show that there is any acknowledgement in the Community of north-south thinking.  I warn of the dangers in that approach.</P>
    <P>Europe must begin to realise that, in the future, the principal voices will come from the south and they will address the issues of aid, trade and debt and there will not be the polite discourse we have had up to now.  I think the migrant problem is part of that issue.  The approach to migration is to reach out and offer some failed economic theories and to suggest imposing them on many developing countries instead of listening to the new and imaginative thinking, thinking informed by solidarity, the ecology, new versions of trade and feminism because many of the developing countries are building their best work on work done by women.  These are people we should see as our fellow partners and we should be thinking in a planetary way.</P>
    <P>If the Europe of the future is to be inward looking, leaving off the agenda the important issues of its sub-population, if at the same time it is refusing to look at the south/north dialogue and if it is going to concentrate on a theory of interests, we will have many more difficult summits than the Edinburgh Summit.  The way forward is in the recovery of the moral moment of foreign policy &mdash; I mention that consciously &mdash; the celebration of solidarity, inter-dependency and its delivery into a meaningful discourse which can be understood, is participatory and will create a Europe of the peoples rather than a Europe of dated and dead ideas and declining institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much for your kind words which I greatly appreciate. Since this is my first opportunity to <Col N="374" /> speak in this House may I reciprocate in kind by wishing you in your high office as Ceann Comhairle the best wishes for the conduct of that office in the course of the 27th Dáil.  Indeed, it is a curious prospect to describe one's first speech as a maiden speech.  I am sure there must be a less sexist phrase in the lexicon of possibilities nowadays to so describe it.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that my first speech in this House should be about European affairs because it is one of the political areas in which I have a very deep and passionate interest.  I join in some of the comments made by Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Higgins in respect of the process in which we are now engaged.  There are a number of questions I should like to put.  This morning on the Order of Business Deputy McManus put a question and wondered whether there was to be any answer.  Unlike her, I know there is to be no answer to any question I raise, because this is a process of making statements, holding forth for half and hour and not having a dialogue or searching through the various issues.  That is a regrettable aspect of the business of the House on European affairs.  Regardless of who is involved in the incoming administration I hope they will address this matter as a priority.  It is one of the failures of the last Government, in which my own party participated, that although we put on the agenda for government reform of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and proposed a much more vigorous joint committee, building on the work done under the chairmanship of Deputy Barry, I regret that nothing happened by the end of the last Dáil to put that extremely important mechanism in place.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I join with the Taoiseach's remarks regrding Mr. Dermot Nally the retiring Government Secretary and place on record our deep appreciation for the integrity of his work throughout our period in office.  I say that on behalf of Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy both of whom hold him in the highest esteem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> Regarding the issues before us, I propose to limit myself to the extensive, though narrow, ground of the Conclusions of the Presidency and will not go through any wider excursion at this time of other views I may have and share, in some respect, with Deputy Higgins.</P>
    <P>The Edinburgh Summit was extremely difficult for the Community because of the unresolved issue of Denmark failing to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, the financing issue and because many of the States which would have to pay more for cohesion and solidarity within the Community were facing severe budgetary problems and one could not automatically presume an easy entitlement to their good will.  Notwithstanding their conviction that we needed solidarity and cohesion, their budgetary circumstances acted as a constraint.</P>
    <P>There are many countries very anxious to get ahead with the enlargement negotiations. Following the impasse at Lisbon, there were two conditions laid down: Maastricht had to be ratified and the Delors II financial package had to be agreed, because to have neither cleared would leave an impediment in the way of enlargement.  The recent tentative conclusion of the GATT Round and the obvious and deep divisions in member states about the impact on their national interest, loomed large in the Conclusions of the Presidency.  We had the collapse of parts of the exchange rate mechanism and the severe stress of other parts of it going into the Edinburgh Summit. Indeed, coming out of the Birmingham Summit one was left with a rather sanguine view of what might emerge in the end.</P>
    <P>It is worth putting on the record &mdash; it has not received too much concentration in the House today &mdash; that we are on the threshold of the completion of the Single Market, a major and significant event in the integration of the European Community. In a formal sense the Edinburgh Summit marked the end of the current phase of the Single Market on 1 January next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> That was the perspective which carried into Edinburgh and it left the Presidency, uniquely, with very many difficult issues on its plate.  I have to say that in a recent contribution in Strasbourg after the Birmingham Summit I was moved towards considerable pessimism about the prospects of the UK Presidency.  I recalled &mdash; it was one of those images which stuck in my mind &mdash; 1 July of this year and the meeting which took place in Downing Street between many members of the European Commission, if not all of them, and the members of the British Cabinet. It was a wet day and the delegates came out of Downing Street for what was probably the essential purpose of their business, the photocall for the 9 p.m. news. They stood under a Presidency umbrella with the British Prime Minister, John Major.  On the first day of its unveiling, that umbrella had on it the logo of the British Presidency &mdash; a white animal surrounded by the 12 European stars.  At that time I took this white animal to be the British lion in the heart of Europe and a symbol of the sense of purpose of the UK Presidency.  After the Birmingham Summit I wondered aloud in the European Parliament whether, in fact, the white animal might not have been a sheep and whether, after the disconsolate outcome of the Birmingham Summit, the sheep may not even have been a dead sheep.  I am glad to say that at the end of the process for a variety of reasons &mdash; one was the contribution John Major made by the end, particularly in abandoning some of the more British stances which had complicated his Presidency in the middle and another was the willingness of the paymasters of the Community to put the money and not just the rhetoric up front &mdash; we were given a conjunction of circumstances which produced a very satisfactory result on the financial side.</P>
    <P>The first point of specific detail I should like to touch on is the completion of the Internal Market.  It is a magnificent achievement for the European Community to have done what it has done since 1985 in that regard.  This was based on a White Paper at that stage which set <Col N="377" /> out to legislate over 500 items of European legislation which, in turn, required to be transposed into national law in all member states.  The process of transposition is incomplete in various degrees in member states but at the European level the 500 primary pieces of legislation are now in place.  It is a tribute to the work of all the European institutions and the national parliaments which combined to create the context for the Single Market.</P>
    <P>When people in general thought about the Single Market, they looked at a few good tests as to what the popular view of that would be.  Certainly one of them was the hope that people would get cheaper cars.  Anyone who sat through the debate on the second Finance Bill today and learnt about the registration tax proposed in lieu of excise duty, which we now, as it were, have done away with it to bring us into the European ambit on excise taxes, will realise, of course, that as soon as we opened up the possibility of cheaper cars through lowering excises we closed it for good Exchequer reasons through the new registration tax.  That is one of the little points of contact and contract between the Community and the individual where many individuals would have felt somewhat let down.</P>
    <P>I observe this only because I want to refer to a bigger and more fundamental part of the contract with a citizen and on which I have a question.  This relates in specific terms to the freedom of movement. There is an agreement in continental EC countries, among the Schengen countries &mdash; the founder countries minus Italy &mdash; to do away with all of the difficulties at borders for individuals. I wonder at the meaning of certain phrases in the Presidency Conclusions.  As I said, I regret that my questions will wither on the vine, there will be no response.  In any event, I will put the question on the record.  It is stated in the Presidency conclusions:</P>
    <P>The European Council has had to take note of the fact that free movement of persons within the Community, in accordance with Article 8a <Col N="378" /> of the Treaty of Rome, cannot be completely assured on 1st January 1993.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that the Schengen countries will get on with that job relatively quickly and that other member states &mdash; I presume this must include Ireland since we are not one of the Schengen countries &mdash; had made known their intention to take various measures to lighten controls at borders on nationals of member states of the Community.</P>
    <P>I thought our contract was to do away with border controls for members of the European Community.  I know that much of the customs procedure will be done away with &mdash; earlier today the Minister for Finance assured the House that Customs and Excise officers would be redeployed to other areas of activity but will we have some kind of border system in Ireland after 1 January in respect of community member state citizens?  If we have such a system, how quickly do we propose, if at all, to do away with it?  If we have it, why do we continue to retain any need for that?  If we continue to have it, are we not in some sense breaking part of the bond and contract across the Community with citizens and their freedom of movement?</P>
    <P>The issue beyond the points I have raised in regard to the Internal Market on which I would like to touch in respect of the Presidency Conclusions and which I greatly welcome, is the emphasis on subsidiarity and transparency.  This emphasis is extremely important.  I hope &mdash; this point has been made by previous speakers &mdash; that we will learn from subsidiarity and transparency <i>á la</i> the EC lessons and principles which we might choose to apply more here in Ireland no less than we expect them of our mutual engagement with the member states of the European Community.  In particular, the notion that decisions should be taken as close to the people or communities as possible is a founding principle of the concept of subsidiarity and if it is good for the European goose it ought to be applicable and good for the Irish gander in terms of local authorities, community groups, partnerships between communities, <Col N="379" /> statutory agencies, voluntary groups and so on.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that there is an emphasis on more transparency.  It was totally apparent during the Maastricht debate in Ireland and elsewhere that the language of the Community and the nature of its business are so far removed from ordinary experience that people found it too distant and remote to relate to it all.  I do not know if the moves on transparency will make a huge difference but they are a start in the right direction. From now on when the Foreign Ministers meet in general affairs councils on occasion &mdash; not on every occasion &mdash; and ECOFIN, the Finance Ministers meet on other occasions we will at least get to see what they were saying on our behalf as there will be a televised process at least for opening statements.  We will also know when there is a vote &mdash; there are many voting procedures in the Treaties &mdash; and we will know who voted what way.  We are also entitled to know the explanation of a vote when one is given. This House should insist that when Ireland votes an explanation be submitted so that we and the Irish people, will know why votes are called on our behalf and cast in a certain way.  I welcome those aspects of the conclusions.</P>
    <P>In respect of subsidiarity, I greatly welcome the fact that good sense prevailed in the end.  A British Presidency proposal, or at least a council proposal I saw floating around Brussels some months ago, that all European legislation had to be tested first for subsidiarity, in other words who does what and whether we have got the lines clear, and only then could one talk about the substance of the law, was a Trojan horse designed to trip up everything before it started.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Presidency Conclusions do not provide for such a system.  That is a welcome relief.  My fear was that in the hands of some of the detractors of the European ideal and the European movement we would see subsidiarity used as a means of dismantling what we have achieved over several decades.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Danish question, <Col N="380" /> the device of a unilateral declaration to be submitted by Denmark is an interesting one.  I welcome the fact that explicitly in that declaration there is a provision which confirms that Irish citizens who, after the Maastricht Treaty is ratified as I believe it will be, by virtue of their Irish citizenship are also citizens of the European Union, will have the opportunity to vote or to run in local elections in Denmark and to vote and run in European elections in Denmark.  They will also have freedom of movement in and the right to reside in Denmark.  None of those rights of the citizen will be partitioned or diminished by the Danish declaration which will be made unilaterally but which raises certain questions about the citizenship issue.  That is important. If such a confirmation were not written down as explicitly as it is, I believe Irish citizens would be entitled to challenge in the Irish courts the diminution of the rights which they voted for in the Maastricht Treaty.  It is a significant and worthwhile accomplishment of those who negotiated this package with Denmark to build in sufficient guarantees for those who have already signed on by giving some freedom and comfort to those in Denmark who wish to move forward to the extent they can with the Community at large.</P>
    <P>On the question of enlargement, I welcome the decision to proceed with the enlargement debate with Sweden, Austria and Finland.  I note a brief passage in the Taoiseach's speech which refers to Switzerland and its recent negative vote in a referendum on the European Economic Area.  While the Taoiseach made a brief reference to this, I regret the fact that in more than 100 pages of the Conclusions of the Edinburgh Council there is not a single reference to the Swiss decision and no reference to the European Economic Area.  I have a question to ask, although I know I will not get the answer.  Will the whole European Economic Area agreement which was recently ratified by this House prior to the dissolution of the last Dáil not now have to come back here on some subsequent date for ratification?  Can somebody <Col N="381" /> tell me, if not today then on another occasion, what is to happen to the Cohesion Fund under the European Economic Area agreement?  That was a fund of 1.5 billion ECU.  It was to be comprised of 500 million ECU in grants and 1 billion ECU in loans and 25 per cent of that was to come from Switzerland, which has opted out.  What is to happen to that?  Are the other countries meant to make up the balance?  It is a significant issue because we stand to be a significant beneficiary.  It was part of our mutual engagement with the countries of EFTA when we agreed to the Treaty that this fund would be established in the terms I have described.  A key player is out, a key partner is missing.  What will happen?</P>
    <P>On the question of immigration, I agree with remarks about the need to tackle racism and xenophobia in the European Community.  I note a reference in the Conclusions to the desire to avoid uncontrolled immigration because it could be destabilising.  Further there are remarks on the Dublin Convention on Asylum which has not yet been ratified. On behalf of a party which is a liberal party, I have great problems with the way we in this country currently deal with the question of asylum.  I have a file of correspondence with the current Minister for Justice.  I have visited people in prison who have done no more wrong than seek political asylum in this State and who find themselves incarcerated as if they were common criminals.  It is not good enough in a country which so often wears its heart on its sleeve in foreign policy terms that people who arrive here destitute, lonely, vulnerable and in many cases not able to speak our language, find themselves in a position where our first response, if it is not to trundle them back on the flight from whence they came, is to put them into a prison and cool them off for some months.  It is not an acceptable way of behaving.  There is a lot in this Conclusion which we need to fix up at home as well as looking at the wider European problem.</P>
    <P>The suggestions in the Conclusions with regard to economic recovery are rather wishy-washy.  Anybody who reads <Col N="382" /> them will see what I mean.  I will refer to one or two points from this section of the Conclusions because they are worth drawing to the attention of the House. One of the questions is how member states can individually contribute to economic recovery.  Several points are made as to what they can do.  I noted with great interest that the Taoiseach quoted two of them and ignored two or three others. I thought it significant that he should exclude some of the criteria.  Those he quoted were that we should take every opportunity, according to national circumstances, to exploit the limited margins of manoeuvre available with regard to our budgetary policy.  Secondly, to the extent possible we should switch public expenditure priorities towards infrastructures and other capital investment and growth supporting expenditure that would earn a worthwhile return.  I and my party very much support such a prospect of capital investment that yields worthwhile economic returns, but I hope in so far as our political debate is moving in that compelling direction in policy terms that we do not use the rhetoric of real return as something to be confused with the substance of real return.</P>
    <P>In the 1970s and 1980s an interesting exercise was done in regard to the public capital programme.  An economist did a simple exercise by asking what would the position have been if we got for the money invested in the Irish public capital programme the same rate of return as we would get by putting the money into the bank.  Our budget deficit was then 12 per cent of national income but we would have had a budget surplus if the capital was only as productive as sticking it in the bank down the road.  I question when I hear talk of productive investment.  I buy the sentiment but I would like to see the substance.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record the parts the Taoiseach did not mention as elements to be considered.  It is stated that there should be measures to encourage private investment, especially in small and medium enterprise, that there should be a reduction of subsidies and an enhancement of competition and market <Col N="383" /> flexibility and that there should be major efforts to restrain wage settlements in the public sector.  This is the prescription given by the Presidency in its Conclusions, having discussed what the Commission recommended, and the leaders of the member states, including the Taoiseach, have signed on for this.</P>
    <P>The major disappointment for me as an Irish person observing the summit is the conclusion on the European Monetary System.  It disappoints me in a European and in an Irish sense.  In a European sense the European Monetary System and the Exchange Rate Mechanism are the key to developing economic and monetary union.  How will we achieve the single currency and what goes with it?  The answer is that, as a Community, we will cross one bridge.  That bridge is the Exchange Rate Mechanism. What has happened to that bridge since we defined it as the key way to achieving the single currency?  Large parts of that bridge have fallen off into the river, carried away in whatever tide of speculation was there.  Italy fell off almost as quickly as it was linked into the system, as did the United Kingdom.  The Spanish peseta loosened twice with devaluations and remains vulnerable and the same story applies to the Portuguese escudo.  The Irish punt, a core part of that bridge, and construction, and the Danish kroner, both tightly linked in the narrow band of currencies since the beginning, have been under stress several times in a major way in recent months.</P>
    <P>Anyone at European level who believes in the European construction towards the single currency would have to give priority to the exchange rate process, and that is a failure of European leadership.  I suspect it may reflect the difficulties that the UK Presidency has in taking a lead where it has had so much difficulty on its own record in that regard.</P>
    <P>It has been an enormous policy failure from an Irish point of view not to have focused on something that has now, perhaps, 30,000 Irish jobs in the firing line in the next few months, that has Irish businesses and householders stretched <Col N="384" /> with high interest rates.  Let me read the Conclusion lest anyone thinks that I exaggerate in talking about it as an enormous failure.  This document runs to about 110 pages.  I found one sentence on the exchange rate system which was, &ldquo;the European Council reiterated its commitment to the European monetary system as a key factor of economic stability and prosperity in Europe&rdquo;.  There is some commitment to what is at the moment our glaring short term economic problem and to what is in European construction terms perhaps one of the biggest problems of all.</P>
    <P>In respect of the famous funds, like Deputy Michael Higgins, I would prefer to come to them at the end than at the beginning because my sense of Europe is much broader, deeper and more committed than the &ldquo;Jonesist&rdquo; mentality. Nonetheless I do not wish to deprecate the fact that I believe cohesion and solidarity are a cornerstone of the European developmental process, part of the cement of integration.  In relation to the funds, the achievement is a significant one.  The diplomacy before it was significant. The blocking of the four cohesion countries as a bloc was a powerful instrument to achieve their just rights &mdash; not a question of getting grants &mdash; as part of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that one should salute the Germans and others who will dip into their pockets to pay.  For my part I will not deprecate the efforts of Irish people involved either.  It has been a powerful achievement, given the financial constraints at present.  It is less than it might have been for the next several years but more than any of us expected on any realistic or fair assessment in advance.  It was an achievement by the officials and the politicians who went there.  As I speak of Irish officials in particular I want to salute the quality of their work in European terms on our behalf no less than our politicians.  In the annual report of the Court of Auditors of the Community we are gold medalists on a number of counts <i>vis-à-vis</i> funds; we are quicker at getting them, we get more of them and we turn them more quickly <Col N="385" /> into actual projects.  We have two gold medals, and we win them every year, and that is a tribute to the quality and capacity of the Irish public service and their national commitment as part of this overall process.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to cite from the Conclusions is an important one.  The Cohesion Funds are available to us and I am glad they will be.  They will be worth a great deal.  However, I draw the House's attention to what is called in the document, macro economic conditionality. We will get the money if we keep our budget in order.  If we have excessive deficits under Article 104 of the Maastricht Treaty we will not get the money and the reasons are spelled out clearly. I welcome that constraint.  One of the difficulties is that we did not have a &ldquo;Maastricht corset&rdquo; on our spending capacity for so many decades before.  I welcome the conditionality and I commend it to the incoming Government as a key criterion in the national interest because it makes sense at home and in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Edinburgh Summit has been a steadying influence on the Community. It has put a good foot forward if not our best.  The failure to deal with the exchange rate system is a glaring error which will have to be addressed by the Danish Presidency.  I welcome the prospect of enlargement and I would welcome it if this House provided the opportunity for Members to be more engaged in the European dialogue, to build the institutions and expertise in the House that will allow us to make our fullest contribution.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has today delivered himself of a rather triumphalist contribution particularly in relation to the funding which he has brought home.  I do not envy him or begrudge him the public relations coup he has managed to pull off, but it probably has as much to do with the negotiations from which he hopes to achieve much over the next week or two as it has to do with reality of what was achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the referendum on European <Col N="386" /> Union, Democratic Left warned that the treaty agreed between Heads of Government at Maastricht was simply not adequate for the needs of people in peripheral regions of the Community such as Ireland.  We pointed out specific defects in the Treaty in the economic, social, democratic, security and defence spheres which made it an unacceptable basis on which to attempt to build European Union, a concept of which we are fully supportive.</P>
    <P>One of our principal concerns was that the commitment to providing for the development of the peripheral regions was both insufficiently funded and inadequately directed.  The Taoiseach returned from Edinburgh quoting figures like a combined Structural and Cohesion Fund package of between £7 billion and £8.3 billion as proof of a successful summit. Obviously, the Taoiseach is quoting £8 billion but others are quoting £7 billion. What is being lost sight of is that the £8 billion is not in any sense guaranteed and that the £8.3 billion to which I referred is the maximum it is possible to achieve. However, experts have indicated that in total the combined Structural and Cohesion Funds could be as low as £7 billion over the seven years which would be significantly below what was promised in the referendum campaign and, indeed, would be only marginally higher than the rate of funding we have received in the current range of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In his bout of triumphalism the Taoiseach quoted me as saying on 23 October that the £6 billion was always an exaggeration. He said that I spoke of a sorry saga of dishonesty, particularly during the referendum campaign, and claimed wrong headed negotiation tactics and objectives.  He went on to say that much of this was echoed in the media.  Unfortunately much of what I said during the referendum campaign was not echoed in the media.  Perhaps if it had been we might have got a better result.  Nevertheless I want to point out that the Taoiseach, as is his wont, was quoting very selectively from what I said in this House on 23 October.  In the course of statements on the Birmingham Summit on 23 <Col N="387" /> October I said, as reported in column 679 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are suggesting that &ldquo;things are tightening up everywhere and there is a lot of tough negotiating to be done&rdquo;.  Next we will be told that it was a negotiating tactic with expectations having to be kept high in order to obtain the optimum outcome.  It would be an apt epitaph to a sorry saga of dishonesty, particularly during the referendum campaign, and plain wrong headed negotiating tactics and objectives.</P>
    <P>I went on to say:</P>
    <P>The fundamental error was, from the outset of the negotiations, to focus on an increase in the Structural Funds as the solution to our cohesion problems. We ought to have pressed for a system of financial transfers such as apply in other federal systems.  Even within its own terms, the Structural Funds are not the best means of utilising the moneys which we do receive.</P>
    <P>In the same column, I said:</P>
    <P>We should have put less emphasis on Structural Funds, which we get by grace and favour, and instead supported the creation of an interventionist industrial policy to put the objective of regional cohesion at the heart of efforts to raise the technological capability of European firms.</P>
    <P>I have no problem whatsoever in standing over what I said on 23 October.</P>
    <P>I still believe that the approach of this and previous Governments in relation to funding from Europe for Ireland and other peripheral regions is the wrong one.  Regardless of how one would consider the sums gained at the weekend at Edinburgh and their size they have still been obtained by grace and favour.  It would be far better for this country within the European Community if there was a federal system of transfers of funds which would be automatic depending on needs <Col N="388" /> and not, as I said, the subject of haggling and negotiation every three or four years.</P>
    <P>These figures and the apparent calm in which the meeting took place at Edinburgh are receiving favourable comment and are in contrast with the fears that the Summit could have witnessed a further deterioration in the Maastricht process and a further retrenchment by the member states away from solidarity with the poorer regions, but we must ask ourselves what is really involved in the crock of gold which the Taoiseach now claims to possess.</P>
    <P>At the time of our referendum, voters were promised a figure of £6 billion over five years.  It now appears that what is on offer is around £7 billion over seven years &mdash; and that is the maximum figure.  The tantalising figure of £3 million a day which it is claimed will flow into Ireland is being waved around by the Government as proof of the extent of the Taoiseach's success at Edinburgh.  As a result of the pay-out during the first round of Structural Funds the inflow to Ireland was close to £2 million a day.  When factors like inflation are taken into account the new figure is greater but not significantly.  As I said, we are talking in terms of a maximum figure of between £6 billion and £7 billion over seven years, whereas voters were promised during the referendum campaign a figure of £6 billion over five years.  I do not propose to bore the House with mathematics but taking the worst possible scenario if we get £6 billion for Structural Funds over seven years this works out only marginally greater than the £2 million per day that we are currently getting.</P>
    <P>All such moneys are of course welcome but the problem is that during the period of the last Structural Funds, job creation and a convergence of Irish and EC average living standards failed to materialise from EC assistance.  It is clear that the money was not used in a planned way to create employment and that the Structural Funds are not geared to the needs of the peripheral regions.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy Cox, who is an MEP, as I was in the past, would tell the House that there are numerous reports <Col N="389" /> at EC level which are highly critical of the way in which funding from the EC &mdash; Structural Funds, Regional Funds and funds under the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; is used and that in many respects these funds act against the best interests of peripheral and poorer regions.  I do not propose to rehearse the figures involved but if the Common Agricultural Policy was examined closely it would be clearly seen that it has worked, in the long term, to the disadvantage of farmers, the farming community and the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left has consistently argued that the allocation of funds should be linked to an EC industrial policy which would assist development in the less well off regions.  In support of this point I would like to quote one person who was in a position to know whether Ireland was gaining or losing from the jobs policies being implemented by the European Community.</P>
    <P>Speaking recently he said that the &ldquo;greatest disappointment&rdquo; of EC membership &ldquo;has been our inability to generate new job opportunities ... The Community's philosophy has always been to get the economy right and the jobs will follow, but this approach must be questioned in the light of experience&rdquo;. The same speaker added:</P>
    <P>Despite the aspirations expressed in the Treaty, redistribution within the Community is still on a very modest level and, as long as it remains at this level, there seems very little prospect of narrowing the gap between richer and poorer.  It should also be noted that adaptation to Community rules has demanded much greater adjustment by the less developed countries, who generally have had to fall in line with the preferences of more powerful members.</P>
    <P>Who was this speaker?  It was none other than the current Taoiseach speaking then as Minister for Finance to the Association of Irish Chartered Accountants in Great Britain in July last year.</P>
    <P>The facts are that however much <Col N="390" /> money we obtain from European Community sources it will not deliver for the mass of Irish people unless it is spent correctly.  That requires a deliberate shifting of resources to promote economic development in Ireland.  The Edinburgh Summit would appear to have barely addressed these inadequacies and this leaves a major question mark over whether the people of Ireland can hope to be any better off as a result in terms of long term economic development and sustainable jobs and wealth creation.</P>
    <P>The fundamental error from the outset of negotiations was to focus on an increase in the Sructural Funds as the solution to our cohesion problems. Instead, as I have said and as I said in my statement on the Birmingham Summit, we should have pressed for a system of financial transfers such as apply in other federal systems.  The crucial question for peripheral regions such as Ireland is not bigger and better Euro hand-outs but rather investment and divestment decisions of the Euro multinationals who are being supported by the Community to face United States and Japanese competition. That is the route to ensuring a real shift of development from the over-crowded centre to the peripheral regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>We also require far greater democracy on how spending of EC funding is decided and allocated, particularly on the national level.  The current system in operation in Ireland is over-centralised in the Department of Finance.  Local and community-based organisations have long pointed out the need for greater democratic involvement and accountability in this process.  The Combat Poverty Agency, for instance, has correctly pointed to the lack of any apparent commitment to the needs of the estimated 50 million people who live in poverty within the Community.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Maastricht process of developing the single market and creating more efficient economic policies in the member states is having an increasingly adverse effect on the unemployed, the marginalised, the homeless and the other victims of the new European Community. <Col N="391" /> The deaths of three homeless people from hypothermia in our own capital city in the past few weeks bears stark testimony to the consequences of economic philosophies and the policies that derive from them which put profit before people.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Maastricht referendum Democratic Left argued that the Irish Government should demand a renegotiation of the Treaty to equip it to deal with Ireland's essential needs.  We pointed out, for instance, that if the initial Delors II package and its crucial component of a phased increase in the budget from 1.2 per cent of Community GNP in 1993 to 1.37 per cent in 1997 had been implemented in full and if the promised average growth rate of 2.5 per cent had materialised, unemployment in the Community would still be about 500,000 higher in 1997 than it is today.  Indeed, even this Delors II proposal was a revised version of a report prepared at the time of the Single European Act proposals in 1986 when he pointed out that a budgetary allocation of 1.4 per cent of GNP by 1993 was required to compensate for the effects of the introduction of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed that the budget will reach only 1.27 per cent of Community GNP by 1997.  It is therefore highly unlikely that any real progress towards achieving cohesion will occur for the remainder of this decade.  We are likely to remain stuck in our position of two thirds of the average EC living standards, a position we have held virtually unchanged over the past two decades of Community membership.  Again, I would refer the House to the Taoiseach's speech today and his rather selective comparative figures on Ireland's living standards <i>vis-á-vis</i> European living standards.</P>
    <P>One of the most glaring omissions from the Edinburgh Summit is in the area of social policy.  It is now generally estimated that by the end of this year and the deadline for the 1992 process, approximately 95 per cent of the Single Market provisions will have been <Col N="392" /> implemented, but only about 30 per cent of the provisions of the social dimension will be in place.  This is a scandalous betrayal of the citizens of Europe in regard to the concept of a Community. Indeed since the adoption of the Social Charter, the main preoccupation seems to have been to seek means to water down the provisions of what was a largely aspirational document in any case. During the Presidency of the British Government, which has been particularly hostile to the concept of a social Europe, there was just one meeting of the Social Affairs Council, and the main achievement of that meeting was to introduce further diluting factors such as the decision on maternity rights, whereby except in the case of the UK women in other EC states will obtain no new benefits.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most interesting feature of the Edinburgh Summit was the manner in which it managed to effectively redefine the Maastricht Treaty to cater for the situation which has arisen in Denmark, following the rejection of the Treaty in the referendum there last June.</P>
    <P>The agreement allows for exemptions from vital aspects of European union for the Danes in the areas of the single currency, common defence, European citizenship and common policing.  Yet, at the time of the Maastricht referendum the Government here insisted that no renegotiation was possible, that re-opening the issue could collapse the whole Maastricht process, and that if we were successful in re-opening the case, the chances were we might end up worse off as a result.</P>
    <P>Under these conditions the Irish electorate were subjected to a virtual blackmail &ldquo;take it or be left behind&rdquo; scenario. Since then it has become clear that voters in other countries have identified serious flaws in the Treaty.  The agreement with the Danish Government allowing for a new referendum in that country next year shows that, as usual, anything is possible and achievable in politics if the commitment and determination is there. Denmark has won the right not to participate in the third stage on European <Col N="393" /> Monetary Union and according to the summit decision &ldquo;will not be bound by the rules concerning the economic policy which will apply only to member states participating in the third stage of European Monetary Union.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I note recently that commentators in the German Bundesbank has indicated that, due to the consequences of German unification, Germany may have difficulty in adhering to the full European Monetary Union strictures.  Yet, the Irish Government has consistently persisted with a level of spending cuts and restrictions in line with European Monetary Union demands which are resulting in immense economic hardship for large numbers of people in this country.</P>
    <P>Denmark has also won agreement not to participate in decisions and actions which have defence implications.  Given Ireland's status as the only EC member state not a member of a military alliance, the Irish Government should have demanded a clear non-militarist and nonnuclear policy for the EC.  Again, this is a case of an opportunity missed for Ireland due to a lack of desire to approach the EC with anything other than a begging bowl approach.</P>
    <P>We have, however, an opportunity to again raise the issue of a more powerful pro-peace voice for the Community in the negotiations for expansion of EC membership which now seems likely to occur.  Austria, Sweden and Finland, three countries with substantial experience of neutrality, are likely to be involved in talks on membership during the Danish Presidency.  I propose that the Irish Government involve itself at a high level in any EC reaction to these applications and actively support whatever proposals emerge from the three applicant countries in relation to military and nuclear de-escalation and the development of the EC as a stronger force for peace and peaceful resolution of conflicts in Europe and the world.  This makes more urgent the need for foreign affairs and European affairs committees to start discussing these areas.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is vital that the Community develops a new approach to assist <Col N="394" /> sustainable development in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  The summit document boasts of having supplied a large amount of assistance to &ldquo;overcome the disasters of drought and famine&rdquo; in the developing countries.  Unfortunately, many of the crises in developing countries are linked to civil wars and conflict carried on using weaponry purchased from EC members states.  The decision at an earlier summit to &ldquo;streamline&rdquo; the EC arms industry and sales is a sobering reminder of the reality of EC policy towards the developing world.  The admission of Nordic countries which have a good reputation on issues such as ODA levels and trade with developing countries opens up new prospects for a more enlightened EC approach in this area.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of internal democracy in the EC institutions and for the Community's citizens.  I note that the summit has responded to the need for more transparency by sanctioning television cameras at some Council meetings in future.  This may make for occasional, perhaps very occasional, good television, but the requirement for greater democracy demands something more substantial.</P>
    <P>There is a need for fundamental reform in the operation of the EC and its institutions. We cannot expect the construction of the European Community to succeed if in the process democracy is the loser.  The lessons of the past year, where it is abundantly clear that citizens in all the member states are becoming increasingly uncertain about the direction and future of the Community, must be taken on board.  Two years ago the Conference of Parliaments in the European Community spelled out a number of detailed proposals to make the Community more democratic and responsive.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left has outlined similar proposals which would include giving powers of co-decision to the European Parliament, referral of draft Community legislation to the Dáil for consideration, more formal involvement of citizens and non-governmental organisations in EC decision and policy-making and transfer of certain powers on a direct and statutory <Col N="395" /> basis to regional and local authorities subject to limited central guidelines.</P>
    <P>This commitment to democracy, more necessary now than ever if the Community is to develop, seems to have been forgotten at Edinburgh.  I am reminded of a comment from the previous Taoiseach on the issue of greater powers for the European Parliament in an earlier Dáil debate, that &ldquo;we do not wish to see decision making become slower and more difficult.&rdquo;  That indeed seems to be the overall attitude to any proposal for greater democracy in the EC.  If we should have learned anything from the <Col N="396" /> events on another part of our Continent in recent years it is that people will only for so long tolerate being denied a full part in the decision making which affects their daily lives.</P>
