      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 9 and 10.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 1 shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 9, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 2.30 p.m. by one question, which shall be put by the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment; (3) the Dáil at its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 April 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, they are not agreed to.  This is another example of the way in which the Government have decided to behave.  They intend to ram through an important Bill, with about 100 amendments still undebated, between now and 2.30 p.m., without any discussion or agreement between the Whips.  It is not satisfactory that such important Bills are put through the House in this manner and we oppose that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 11 hours of debate on the Second Stage of the Bill, and there was no opposition; and six hours have been provided for Committee Stage.  As there was no opposition to the Bill on Second Stage it was reasonable to expect that adequate provision had been made for Committee Stage debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not proceed with no opposition, that is a contradiction in terms.  If there was no Deputy on this side of the House the Taoiseach would have even greater difficulty in saying that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to calm the atmosphere.  It is important that the House address the issues contained in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill in a calm manner.  The Bill has profound implications for the way in which planning matters are dealt with in this country.  Several important amendments will not be reached in the time frame set out, including ones that challenge the constitutionality of provisions in the Bill.  For that reason, I ask the Taoiseach to consider lengthening the period of time allocated for the Committee Stage debate.  Well over 100 amendments have not been debated yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> If the Taoiseach is minded not to move in relation to the provision of additional time and a vote is called on that issue then I ask him to at least allow the provision allowed in relation to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill for Opposition amendments to be accepted, to apply to this Bill also.  I hope the Minister for the Environment will at least be able to accept from this side of the House amendments that are reasoned and acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to the application of the procedure that applied in relation to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem in relation to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill is that the Government did not even approach the Opposition to seek a time agreement, and we were disposed to a time agreement.</P>
      <P>I understood last evening, through the Whips, that the Minister for the Environment would be approaching us about a timescale.  No such attempt was made. It is highly unsatisfactory that attempts should be made to ram legislation through the House without even a modicum of consultation.</P>

      <P>We are being asked to deal with 130 amendments to this Bill, six of which only were dealt with last evening over a number of hours. Despite the fact that the Committee Stage of the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992 had been scheduled for this afternoon it is quite extraordinary that that Bill was dropped &mdash; apparently it is so important &mdash; and the Second Stage, resumed, of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1991 was scheduled for this afternoon.  The Local <Col N="1312" /> Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991 &mdash; Committee Stage, resumed &mdash; could well have been debated this afternoon without any inconvenience to Members.  May I suggest that it is the kind of Bill which should be referred to a special committee of the House for detailed consideration and discussion in view of the large number of amendments tabled to it.  It is not acceptable that legislation, whose provisions will have a fairly serious effect on people's rights to appeal to An Bord Pleanála, should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I propose a compromise rather than waste the time of the House voting on this matter?  I suggest we substitute the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991 for the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1991 this afternoon which would give us another hour and a quarter; in other words, from the end of Question Time to 5 o'clock.  Would that be a fair compromise all round?</P>

On Tuesday, the Taoiseach gave an undertaking in this House that there was nothing to the comment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on radio that morning &ldquo;that the door was slightly ajar&rdquo;, yet yesterday the President of the European Council in the European Parliament said they were anxious to facilitate the Irish Government and the door was ajar in regard to amending the Protocol.</P>

The clear majority view &mdash; and I made it abundantly clear, and it has not changed one lota &mdash; is that the Council of Ministers came to the conclusion that they will not re-open the Treaty.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved this amendment last night and I do not want to spend too long on it.  I want to restate very briefly that what we are dealing with here is what I described as the &ldquo;mission statement&rdquo; of An Bord Pleanála.  Section 2 lays down their duties and objectives.  The terms of the section are couched solely on the need for expedition in dealing with planning appeals.  I seek to temper that expedition with the exhortation that obviously all such decisions would be subject to proper planning and environmental considerations.  The Minister, responding last night, said that this was superfluous verbiage, or words to that effect, that it was understood that the board would be mindful of proper planning and environmental considerations. I strongly emphasise &mdash; and I hope the overnight rest will have helped the Minister to come to the same conclusion &mdash; that there is a strong view among the general public, particularly among those interest groups and individuals concerned with the environment, that this Bill is being put forward at the behest of the pro-development lobby to get around the checks and balances we put into planning appeals, to stop third parties having their say and to thwart the proper planning and environmental considerations. That is not the intention of the House, nor is the intention of the Minister in my view, but we need to be clear in how we state that.  It is in his interest and in the interests of the House that we clearly state in the primary legislation what the Minister states is obvious but is unsaid, <Col N="1335" /> that the board should have regard to proper planning and environmental considerations in all their deliberations and that expedition in processing planning appeals should not be an end in itself.  If, in the Minister's view, this should be understood from the legislation it is not clearly stated.  The Bill would be very much the stronger and the understanding of the people very much the clearer if this was so stated.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 is worthwhile and would be of help in underlining the duty of An Bord Pleanála, in making decisions, notwithstanding time pressures, to have regard to proper planning and environmental considerations.  There is a danger that they will come under pressure to make decisions on planning appeals speedily and while I can understand the reason for this we should not allow a situation to develop where a decision is made on a planning appeal prematurely and without due regard being had to proper planning and environmental considerations. That is not the kind of legislation that this House should enact. Indeed, it is not the desire of the majority of the Members that such legislation be enacted.</P>
      <P>It seems that the section we are dealing with would be improved considerably if the words &ldquo;subject to proper planning and environmental considerations&rdquo; were added as it would be made clear to An Bord Pleanála, notwithstanding the time pressures, that these are not superior to proper planning and environment considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I utterly reject the suggestion made by both Deputy Howlin and Deputy Mitchell that decisions on planning appeals are made prematurely and, second, that this Bill has been introduced in response to pro-development groups. As far as I am concerned, the vast majority of Deputies are pro-development and pro-employment and wish to ensure that the best planning rules are <Col N="1336" /> adhered to by the local authorities, who make the vast majority of decisions, in coming to a decision.  In the context of planning appeals, a balance should be relentlessly sought to give fundamental rights to those who wish to object and those who are afraid that developments will injure their property and at the same time enhance the prospects of realistic development throughout the country.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate on Second Stage Deputies on all sides of the House supported the Bill but on Committee Stage the impression is being given that in some way we are departing from the normal fair and balanced procedures. I reject this suggestion outright.  I should say I am disappointed that Deputies are unwilling to accept my assurance that the words put forward in the amendment are unnecessary from either the legal or practical viewpoint.  As I explained, the board's general duty in section 2 (1) of the Bill is identical to their existing duty under section 4 of the 1983 planning Act. For the record of the House I wish to read that section:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Board to ensure that appeals, references and other matters with which it is concerned are disposed of as expeditiously as may be and, for that purpose, to take all steps as are open to it to ensure that, in so far as is practicable, there are no avoidable delays at any stage in the consideration of such appeals, references or other matters.</P>
      <P>This duty has been in operation for nine years now without compromising the board's duty or ability to deal with appeals in accordance with considerations of proper planning and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's obligations to decide cases on the basis of criteria of proper planning is already clearly spelled out in planning law.  Sections 26 (1) and 26 (5) of the 1963 planning Act lay down that the board's decision must be taken in the light of proper planning and development of the area concerned regard being had, among other things, to the provisions of the <Col N="1337" /> development plan and any relevant special amenity area order.</P>
    <P>I should say also that I am surprised by the apparent contradiction that the Deputies' contributions on his amendment seem to reveal.  On the one hand, there is a fairly general acceptance that there is an important public interest in having expeditious decisions on planning appeals but, on the other, Deputies are seeking to modify a legal duty of efficiency which has been in existence since 1983 and which has clearly posed no problems for the board in terms of dealing with cases in a fair and thorough manner.  I do not believe that the Bill would be improved in any way by the amendment and I must, accordingly, decline to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister believes we are being unreasonable in some way because the reason we tabled the amendment in the first place was that we wanted to ensure that no other interpretation of this section could be given by anybody, be they pro-development or pro the environmental lobby.  We must ensure that no one will be in any doubt in the future about the intentions of this House in regard to the wording of any section in legislation or, for that matter, having regard to the present controversy, a constitutional amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even this section of the Bill includes the famous words &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo;. We know where these led us and the Minister admitted this morning on a different subject that their inclusion can lead to misinterpretation, misrepresentation and doors being left open. Deputy Howlin wants to copperfasten the duty of the board or, indeed, any officer of the board in the future to have regard to proper planning and environmental considerations.  Given that they have been included in another section, what is wrong with writing them in again to make it clear that even though we want decisions to be made as expeditiously as possible we do not want it to be inferred that a decision was arrived at without proper regard being had to all the matters <Col N="1338" /> which are a source of concern for all of us?</P>
    <P>While most, if not all, Deputies are pro-development very few do not have regard to environmental considerations. This goes without saying, be they members of the Cabinet or members of the Opposition.  People do not want dirty jobs at any price.  While we want jobs we also want to ensure that a proper attitude is adopted towards the environment.  This is particularly true in the case of the mining industry where at times developers cannot put their case which could lead to thousands of jobs being created in many parts of the country if proper environmental standards were adhered to and impact studies were carried out.</P>
    <P>The words proposed are not superfluous; they are definitive.  Having regard to the fact some of the officers of the board have made some controversial decisions in the past, we want to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that people, in particular the environmental lobby, are in no doubt that we mean business in putting forward this wording.  Even though the Minister is unwilling to include it, I hope that between now and Report Stage he will consider an alternative wording to accommodate the views expressed by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Mitchell in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the product of pressure.  The section of the Bill we are now dealing with will expose the board to even further pressure.  This Bill has been produced because of a perception on the part of developers that delays at the planning appeals stage were holding up development.  The perception was allowed to develop that there were people out there who were, willy nilly, putting in vexatious planning appeals and holding up the whole system.  We now have this Bill which proposes to shorten the period of time within which appeals can be made, to shorten the whole procedure with regard to the exchange of documents and the period of time within which An Bord Pleanála has to come to their decision.  On top of that we have this general duty imposed on the board that <Col N="1339" /> it must ensure that appeals are disposed of as expeditiously as may be.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to qualify that somewhat by having regard to the need for proper planning and environmental considerations.  It is, as the Minister says, what An Bord Pleanála should be taking into account in any event, that is, proper planning and environmental considerations. The only problem is that those requirements are not written into the Bill.  All that is written into the Bill is that the board must get the job over and done with as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>That section of the Bill might well be in conflict with other sections of the Bill where the board has been given the right to request additional submissions and so on.  We must look forward a little bit to a situation where, if this Bill is enacted in the way proposed, An Bord Pleanála will be exposed to pressure.  When an appeal has been submitted developers will start to heap the pressure on to An Bord Pleanála, quoting this section of the Bill and saying that it is the job of An Bord Pleanála, having got all the relevant documents and the replies and so on, to make a decision as quickly as possible. An Bord Pleanála, for their own reasons, might want to slow down the process, might want to get additional expert opinion, submissions or whatever, and might want to exercise that right under other sections of this Bill.  What will happen in practice is that the telephones in the offices of An Bord Pleanála will be hopping with the calls from the planning consultants or architects who have been engaged by the developer pressing for immediate decisions.  I can guarantee that if this section of the Bill is not qualified, it will be quoted over and over again by developers, claiming that it is in the legislation that An Bord Pleanála must make a decision as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of the concerns expressed by many Members of this House &mdash; and we will come to this at a later stage &mdash; about the period of four months within which the board have to make a decision will be justified.  It is the opinion of planners <Col N="1340" /> themselves, of An Taisce, of many members of the public and Members of this House that that period of four months is too tight, that there are many circumstances where it may be necessary to extend the time particularly where there is a large and complicated planning application involved so that the board can make a proper decision.  If this section is not qualified, An Bord Pleanála will come under increasing pressure to make the decision within four months, or to make the decision in a shorter time than four months because it says clearly in the Bill that it is the duty of An Bord Pleanála to make the decision as expeditiously as possible.  It needs to be qualified and have regard to proper planning and environmental considerations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two points.  Once again Deputy Gilmore seems to imply that this Bill is introduced on the basis that everything was perfect in An Bord Pleanála prior to its introduction. The Deputy knows that everybody on this side and on the other side have been looking for ways to improve the planning appeals system over the years because it is too slow, resulting in many developmental prospects being negatived.  Quite a number of procedures not requiring legislation were adopted and gradually fairly vast improvements were made.  At the end of the day it was discovered that it would not be possible to improve the position any further through those channels and that there was still room for a system which would have legal status to ensure that planning appeals were dealt with as expeditiously as possible without taking away any fundamental rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give the Deputy an example of where a tremendous effort was made to get a development going here.  When planning permission was granted by the local authority there was an appeal to An Bord Pleanála which took almost 12 <Col N="1341" /> months to decide, during which time that project was lost, even though An Bord Pleanála ultimately decided in favour of the original planning application.  That resulted in the loss of 30 jobs.  If that decision could have been taken within four or five months the project could have been held.  I wanted to put these rather crude and raw facts before the House. Deputies on the other side of the House cannot afford to ignore the realities.  We are all concerned to ensure that the best possible and most balanced system is developed.</P>
    <P>At no stage did anyone in this House take the view that this planning Bill replaces everything else in the Planning Acts up to now.  We start with the basic 1963 Act and the amendments of 1983. In the 1963 Act, section 26 (1) provides that the planning authority shall be restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area.  In legal terms the proper planning and development of an area takes account of all the concerns expressed by the Opposition. It is not possible, in the context of every Bill that comes to the Dáil to ignore the brace of legislation already enshrined in legislation and put everything into the new provision whether it existed heretofore or not.  That would be superfluous and has never been the practice in this House.</P>
    <P>I cannot go any further than that, except to indicate that the existing body of legislation, taking all the Acts together, meets the Deputy's requirements. Adding it in here may not have the effect the Deputies desire.  It is unnecessary.  I would ask Deputies to accept that what we have already in the total body of planning legislation takes full account of the concerns that have been expressed.</P>

      <P>I move amendent No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between line 43 and 44, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  In the case of appeals lodged in relation to domestic extensions, single dwellings or similarly small developments the Board should make every reasonable endeavour to have the matters decided within two months.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We must distinguish between major and minor planning applications and appeals. This amendment seeks to speed up appeals in relation to domestic extensions, single dwellings or similarly small developments.  Very often appeals in relation to such developments would relate to conditions and they rarely give rise to the same public concerns that arise in major planning applications.  People who are trying to improve their homes by building kitchen or bathroom extensions should not have to wait another four months for a planning appeal to be decided.  It should be possible to decide on these small matters speedily.  The Minister ought to welcome the opportunity to build flexibility into the legislation in relation to different types of planning applications and appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, particularly where local authorities have given planning permission, and appeals are on the basis of a third party objection to An Bord Pleanála.  There is a requirement on the local authority to give a decision within two months.  It would not be a burden to require An Bord Pleanála to decide on these simple appeals within two months.  Often objections at local level to small developments are vexatious ones and would not require an extended <Col N="1343" /> period for investigation.  Two months should be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support this amendment.  I take the point that it should not normally take as long for a planning decision or an appeal concerning a domestic extension or a small development to be dealt with, as it does for a large development.  The whole area with regard to planning permission for domestic extensions and the way applications are dealt with is something that should be looked at.  When a planning permission is being granted for a housing estate, for instance, it should be possible to give a general permission indicating the type of extension which would be permissible for the houses concerned. Most of these extensions are fairly standard, for instance the garage conversion type of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with three sets of circumstances.  It deals with domestic extensions, single dwellings and similarly small developments, which could be to a shop or some other small business.  Some of the most controversial planning applications I have come across have concerned this kind of small development. I know of one porch extension at the moment which is causing controversy, admittedly among a small number of people, but it is going to court because a neighbour claims that the porch is extending onto a common pathway for two adjoining houses.  The sort of rows that develop over single dwellings can be quite significant.  To reduce the appeal time to two months in those circumstances is too restrictive.  This should be left to the discretion of the board. There is no reason why it should take four or six months for a simple application or appeal to be dealt with but to restrict all those to two months is too restrictive. There will be controversy with regard to domestic extensions or single dwellings. There was one famous case in Howth not so long ago in which a single dwelling involved quite an amount of public controversy.  There will also be controversy with regard to small developments, <Col N="1344" /> for instance a shop, or a change of use.  I know of a case where use changed from a domestic extension to a shop, to a dry cleaners and now to a take-away food shop.  That sort of change of use development would probably qualify under &ldquo;similarly small development&rdquo;.  To restrict it to two months is overly restrictive and I regret that I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am broadly sympathetic to what Deputy Mitchell is trying to do.  The Green Party will be the last party to increase bureaucracy.  There is enough of it already.  I realise that sometimes there can be vexatious appeals due to bad neighbourliness and there are many examples of this.  I have problems with the Deputy's amendment.  I wonder if it is legally watertight?  I am not a legal expert but the Deputy talks about similarly small developments.  Who decides whether a development is small, medium or large and how is a domestic extension defined?  Under the planning laws at the moment there are fairly generous exemptions for domestic extensions. Many small domestic extensions can be built without planning permission and that is as it should be.  We do not want to stand in the way of people who want to make simple small changes in their accommodation, by keeping them waiting for months.</P>
      <P>I agree that if my amendment No. 7 is passed one could make the case that applications of this nature would be held up for six months.  If my amendment is accepted we will have to look again at its implications for single dwellings and domestic extensions.  That is another day's work and it should not take away from the validity of my amendment when it comes up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a single dwelling might not impinge very much on the community, it can impinge very seriously on the people on either side of it, at the back of it or opposite it.  A person who has invested his life's savings in a house must have rights when he finds an unsuitable development, even a single house, going <Col N="1345" /> up next door.  We are talking only about the difference between two and four months, and a house is built to last a lifetime.  The Minister has struck the right balance in prescribing a four month period in respect of these types of development.  For that reason I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Mitchell. In routine or simple cases a four month timescale might seem to be rather long.  However, the appeals submitted must be circulated to other parties and they have one month to respond.  Taking that into account, the period available to the board, sticking rigidly to a two month determination time, could be down to a couple of weeks.  I take it that is not what the House would want.  My intention is that the objective of four months will apply in the case of all appeals and other cases initially.  I will keep the matter under review and the question of prescribing a shorter period for more routine types of cases can be considered in the light of experience of the operation of the four month period.</P>
      <P>I have been rather lonely on this side of the House.  I thought I would never meet a situation where there would be a difference of opinion among Opposition Deputies.  For some reason this morning there is a small cleavage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy for both views.  We are providing a four month period for An Bord Pleanála to determine appeals and we have to give the fullest possible opportunity for the system to work.  We will review the position in regard to appeals of the nature outlined by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I differ somewhat from Deputies in the views expressed about house extensions. Extensions of up to 23 square metres in floor areas are exempt from the requirement to seek planning permission.  I have seen house extensions in various parts of the country which I would rather not have seen.  Every kind of small extension is not <Col N="1346" /> acceptable to us all.  It is important in the context of overall planning and environmental considerations that every type of planning application should take account of the landscape, the needs of the applicant and the rights of others.  That is the general aim.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is not workable. In the long run we will have experience of how this provision operates.  It may be that there are classes of application for planning permission which could be dealt with according to tighter criteria.  The board, once they are in a position to do so, should make their decisions within this timeframe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to facilitate people who are trying to improve their homes.  We are not trying to bypass proper planning considerations. The Minister makes the point that two months would be too short a time for the board to decide these matters, but the planning authorities are expected in the first instance to decide within two months.  The vast majority of local authority planning decisions are not appealed.  If the planning authority can make decisions within two months, why not the board, in respect of routine small cases?  I accept that larger planning applications for housing estates or industrial developments may need more time, perhaps more than four months in certain circumstances; but that should not be the case in regard to single house extensions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore made the point that some of these applications can be the cause of dissension between neighbours. This amendment does not make it compulsory on the board to decide within two months; it provides that the board should make every reasonable endeavour to decide within two months.  Even where there is a division of opinion among neighbours in regard to the original planning application, the planning authority have to decide within two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been references to bureaucracy.  This term conjures up images of local authority officials or civil servants who want to put everything on the long finger.  The real bureaucracy <Col N="1347" /> manifests itself in this House this morning in our inflexibility of thought.  We should try to distinguish between different types of planning application.  Certain categories should be easily disposed of by the board within two months.  I am disappointed that the Minister, while sympathetic to the purpose of the amendment, has not indicated a readiness to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not realise he had another good man behind him.  I felt there was a danger that we might extend the period beyond four months, which would be ridiculous.  It would be impossible to differentiate between various sizes of application.  One person might define a small extension as the addition of extra space to the kitchen or the construction of an extra toilet.  To somebody else living in another area a small extension could consist of a massive construction of a size similar to that of an inner city house.</P>
      <P>Some of the extensions in the Clontarf area are absolutely massive.  The neighbours must be protected in these cases. It could happen that a neighbour would be away or ill and might not have the opportunity to object, I am happy to accept the Minister's suggestion that the period allowed should be four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a believer in putting provisions into legislation which obviously will not work, no matter how well intentioned.  It is a pity Deputy Mitchell interprets that as being inflexible. It would be impossible to legislate for different sizes and classes of extension. With regard to the statutory obligation on local authorities to decide on planning applications within two months, the case to impose a similar obligation to An Bord Pleanála does not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority may begin the processing of an application for planning permission on the day they recieve it.  An Bord Pleanála may not consider an application <Col N="1348" /> until such time as the parties to the appeal make their submission, for which they have one month.  On that basis alone a comparison of the two bodies in terms of the timescale is not feasible. Second, from information available to me &mdash; I do not have the statistics here this morning &mdash; the local authority are unable, for one reason or another, to make a decision within the prescribed two months on almost 30 per cent of the total applications submitted to them. Therefore, to presume that local authorities make a decision within two months in all cases is wrong.  Clearly there is need for reform to improve the position of local authorities and I am quite sure that can be done.  If Deputy Mitchell takes that into account he will understand why it is not possible to meet his very well intentioned amendment.  It is neither practical nor feasible and probably ultimately is not fair.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 in the names of Deputies Garland and Gilmore.  Amendments Nos. 8 and 10 are related and it is proposed, therefore, for discussion purposes, that we take amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 10 together.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2) (a), line 1, to delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to section 2 of the Bill which prescribes that the board shall determine an appeal within four months of its receipt.  This is the nub of the Bill.  It puts undue pressure on An Bord Pleanála to make hasty decisions on appeals, even of the most complex nature.  Four months is simply not adequate, hence I propose to amend this section by increasing the time to six months.  In amendment No. 10 which we are also debating, in cases where environmental <Col N="1349" /> impact statements are required I propose that the time be extended to nine months.</P>
    <P>In his Second Stage speech, the Minister made the point that we want to streamline the planning process.  Everyone would agree with that provided it can be done without a reduction in the quality of the board's work.  This Bill does not strike a proper balance.  It is pro-industry and pro-development but it provides insufficient protection for the ordinary members of the public who have every right to be concerned about largescale projects on their doorstep, and it is fundamentally undemocratic.  I concede that there have been at times considerable delays by An Bord Pleanála, but laterally the position has improved beyond measure.  In general, An Bord Pleanála determine most appeals within six months.  As the Minister said in his Second Stage speech, in only 2.8 per cent of cases were the appeals on hand for more than six months.</P>
    <P>I admit that problems arose in 1985 and 1989 when in excess of 15 per cent of appeals were on hand for over six months, but it should be remembered that there has been a big increase in the number of appeals &mdash; there was a 35 per cent increase in 1989 over 1988 &mdash; and that An Bord Pleanála had only 58 staff in 1989 compared with 73 in 1988.  It is important that decisions are not rushed in order to give preference to quantity over quality as often careful decisions are needed to resolve complex cases.</P>
    <P>In this context the board's comments in their 1985 report are particularly relevant. They say:</P>
    <P>Many appeals are probably cases that have raised difficult issues at local level arising from the implementation of the provisions of the development plan, the protection of amenities and the need to reconcile proposals with the proper planning and development of the area.  A number raise contentious third party issues.  These cases by their nature require more time for processing and careful consideration, <Col N="1350" /> a factor which is sometimes overlooked in criticisms of the system.</P>
    <P>This is an appeal from the heart of An Bord Pleanála who are trying to do their job properly and who have been underfunded and under-staffed.  The staff of An Bord Pleanála do not want to delay appeals.  They get great satisfaction from clearing their desks.  Many of the problems with An Bord Pleanála relate to under-staffing which results from the crazy embargo which was imposed willy nilly on the Civil Service and which is a nonsense in view of the huge numbers unemployed.  I call on the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment thereby arriving at the correct balance between the interests of development and the interests of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Garland is correct in stating that the nub of the Bill is that it limits the period of time within which An Bord Pleanála must make their decisions.  The Minister is proposing to move from an open-ended position where there is no statutory time limit within which a decision must be made to a position where the decision must be made within a period of four months. Deputy Garland and I are proposing that the four month limit be extended to six months at the very least.  That is not to say that An Bord Pleanála should take six months to make a decision in relation to every planning appeal.  Quite clearly, many planning appeals may be decided in a much shorter period but there are appeals and issues which will take longer than four months to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look back at the history of the planning appeals system and the reason for delays in that system.  This Bill results from delays in the planning appeals system, but those delays were not due to any legislative defect but to a shortage of staff and resources in An Bord Pleanála. Between 1988 and 1989 the overall staff of An Bord Pleanála was reduced by 20 per cent.  The number of staff at inspector grade was down by 50 per cent by 1989-90, the time when pressure was brought <Col N="1351" /> to bear to speed up the planning appeals system.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill will not entail additional staffing or financial requirements for An Bord Pleanála.  The delays that have been occurring in the planning appeals system have not resulted from any legislative defect but from the fact that there was a reduction of staff and resources in An Bord Pleanála.  That is where the problem lay, and one does not address a problem of staff and resources by introducing a Bill which provides that appeals must be decided within four months.  In effect, that puts additional pressure on limited staff and resources to make decisions within an even shorter period of time and may result in poor decisions being made.</P>
    <P>Professionals in the planning system do not believe that four months is a sufficient time limit for planning appeals.  The Irish Planning Institute stated that the time framework for determining appeal cases must allow adequate time for the reasonable circulation of documents, as outlined in section 3 (7), and for the proper assessment of the case.  It was stated that five months was considered the minimum time necessary to achieve that and that the time period should commence six weeks from the date of the planning authority decision.  In other words, the minimum time that the planning professionals themselves reckon to be required is five and a half months.  An Taisce made a similar case arguing that the four month time limit was too short.</P>
    <P>An appeals system operates in many areas of public life.  I find it interesting that it is only in the area of planning appeals, in which developers, development and money are involved, that the Government have chosen to introduce legislation that will provide a statutory limit for the decision of an appeal.  I would welcome legislation that provided a statutory limit for decisions on social welfare appeals, employment appeals, appeals on the issue of medical cards and a range of different matters in which the ordinary citizen is concerned.  It is strange that it is only in the area of planning <Col N="1352" /> appeals that a statutory limit is to be introduced, a limit that is too short.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing for the extension of the time limit because it is my opinion or the opinion of individual Members of the House that that should be so but because that is the opinion of the professionals who work in the planning system and the opinion of the most reputable bodies that have contact with the planning system. The proposed four month time limit is too short and should be extended to six months at the very least.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the establishment of a statutory limit for determining appeals in general.  I would support legislation to establish time frames on all of the appeal mechanisms outlined by Deputy Gilmore.  All of the time we deal with disgraceful cases relating to inordinate delays people experience in getting their rights.  Justice delayed is justice denied.</P>
      <P>It is important to consider the efficacy of the timeframe proposed by the Minister. The statistics provided seem to indicate that a period of four months would cover the vast majority of appeals.  For the vast majority of appeals I have no difficulty in accepting a time limit of four months.  It is the extraordinary appeals that would require an environmental impact assessment that could present real difficulties.  Those appeals are the more controversial appeals, they arouse the most public disquiet and the most public attention and they should be treated in a different fashion from the majority of appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section in the Bill provides for two categories in the determination of appeals.  There is the general provision that appeals shall be decided within four months.  Then section 2 (2) (a) gives the Minister the power to prescribe any other such period in respect of a particular class or classes of appeals as he decides.  What are the Minister's intentions in relation to the regulations?  I would need an answer to that question before I could be content with the provision.  The previous Minister for the Environment often referred to what is a hobby horse of mine, <Col N="1353" /> that is, that I object to an increasing amount of important legislation being conducted by way of secondary legislation, statutory instrument, rather than by way of enactment in primary legislation. I hope the Minister will not take the approach of saying that a legislative step will be taken by way of regulation rather than by way of enshrinement in a proper statute that is democratically scrutinised before the House.  Too many legislative measures are taken by way of statutory instrument and too few are taken in clear terms by way of primary legislation.</P>
    <P>One cannot disentangle the issue of staffing from that of the timeframe required for the making of decisions. Even if we were to accept that a period of four months was reasonable for the vast majority of appeals, next year or the year after a Minister or a Government could again squeeze the staffing complement of An Bord Pleanála to make it impossible for the staff to live with that statutory timeframe.  In order to try to meet the time limit An Bord Pleanála would have to cut corners.  Corner cutting happens already in some local authorities which might be squeezed for personnel and resources.  When they come up against a statutory time limit for making initial planning decisions one finds that they have not had time to discuss an issue with the local planning committee made up of democratically elected members.  I know of frequent occasions on which an issue was discussed but before the district committee dealing with planning issues had time to meet again the planning decision would have had to be made and often would have had to be made without the full information that would be available for local democratically elected members.</P>
    <P>I fear that a timeframe set down in statute without a guarantee of proper resources &mdash; in fact, the explanatory memorandum clearly indicates that the resources will not be augmented &mdash; will show the Bill to be a mechanism available to a Government or a Minister to allow shortcuts to take place and to require decisions to be made without the necessary <Col N="1354" /> resources required for a full and proper consideration of all of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that the planning decision process can be extricated from the required staffing complement.  The Minister must give firm guarantees that the resources necessary to implement this legislation will be provided to An Bord Pleanála.  Obviously, even a guarantee of that kind would not be binding on the Minister's successors were we to take the Minister in good faith.</P>
    <P>There are very serious implications in the implementation of the Bill.  My own amendment seeks to exclude the small number of planning applications that would require environmental impact statements.  If an environmental impact statement were required a planning appeal should be treated in a different way.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me that he intends to deal with those appeals separately under the provisions of section 2 (2) (b), but I would much prefer that to be spelt out in unambiguous terms in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I shall not go over the ground covered by other speakers who talked about the submissions received from An Taisce and other organisations outlining the statutory difficulties that arose in 1988-89 and that caused delays and the buildup of pressure that probably &mdash; although the Minister would be loathe to admit it &mdash; initiated the introduction of this legislation. A reasonable compromise would be for the Minister to accept the premise that the vast majority of appeals could be determined within a time limit of four months, which is not unreasonable, but those that required environmental impact statements should be treated separately and could not be determined within a four month appeals system.  All the independent advice I have received &mdash; which I am sure is available to all Deputies &mdash; states quite clearly that it would be quite impossible to provide a proper environmental impact assessment within the timescale suggested.  I contend it would not be in the interests of good, proper planning, or of the environment, that we would seek to force decisions <Col N="1355" /> to be taken without proper time being allowed for the collection of all the data required for a full, comprehensive environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the complaints I hear in relation to An Bord Pleanála focus on the fact that appeals can go on forever.  Therefore, I welcome the four months provision in section 2 (2) (a).  I disagree with what Deputy Gilmore said with regard to the need for the introduction of legislation setting a timescale in regard to social welfare and other matters. That is a negative aspect or attitude to adopt.  I would contend that legislation should be introduced, whenever possible, whenever we perceive a void, as there has been in this case.  Perhaps legislation should be introduced to limit the timescale for appeals in relation to social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>If we examine the provisions of this Bill we discover there is a positive and negative aspect to planning appeals.  As a member of Dublin Corporation I have complained more frequently about An Bord Pleanála overruling decisions of the relevant local authority.  So we must remember that aspect as well.  For example, there could be a development proposed within one's local area to which one might be utterly opposed.  That may continue and within six months an appeal may have been lodged which was not upheld and the development continues to which one, as an individual and the relevant local authority, may be utterly opposed.  Under the provisions of this subsection such an appeal must be terminated within a period of four months, which proposal I totally support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might cite the example of an enormously expensive development, say, on the north side of this city, where the profit factor may not be as great as would obtain had the same development taken place on the south side of the city.  Let us suppose a builder/developer had proposed a certain amount of funding which expired after four months, that development might never be completed.  On the north side of the city, along the quays and so <Col N="1356" /> on, there has been rapid development but we must remember there are other parts of the city warranting the expenditure of large sums of money on development.  In such cases, if somebody objects, it is possible such development would not go ahead.  We must remember that if somebody objects, lodges an appeal with An Bord Pleanála who, in turn, overrule local people's or the local authority's objections, that must take place within four months.</P>
    <P>In any serious case necessitating an environmental impact assessment the Minister has power, under the provisions of section 2 (4) (b) to extend that timescale. I am sure the purpose behind that subsection is to cater for unusual decisions.  I feel quite happy with the provision.  While appreciating that Members table such amendments for very good reasons, at the same time having witnessed what has taken place over the past few years, I contend the provisions of this Bill are crucial and should be implemented at this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of this section which impose a timescale for the determination of appeals on the part of An Bord Pleanála.  Heretofore there had been no such timescale.  Most Members here who are also members of local authorities, and have been actively involved in appeals to An Bord Pleanála will probably welcome the fact that henceforth a decision will have to be taken within a given timescale.</P>
      <P>In relation to whether that timescale for determination of planning appeals should be four months, five months or six months, it is my belief that if the Minister's intentions are enacted he will make the necessary resources available to ensure that any such decision can be taken within the period specified, that is four months.</P>

    <P>Perhaps the Minister would confirm that such resources will be made available to local authorities and to An Bord Pleanála enabling them to meet the four months timescale, particularly since a number of people have made submissions indicating that a four months' timescale <Col N="1357" /> may be somewhat too tight within which to have decisions taken.  Perhaps the Minister could also indicate how, whenever additional information is sought by either party, or whenever there are proposals for alterations of an application before An Bord Pleanála, that would affect the four months timescale.  I look forward to the Minister clarifying his powers within the relevant subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to extend from four to six months the timescale for determination of planning appeals and other matters by An Bord Pleanála.  In selecting that timescale for the determination of cases by the board care was taken to strike a reasonable balance between the need for the appeals process to operate expeditiously and the equally important need to ensure that the board would have adequate time to consider thoroughly the issues arising in any given case.  I am satisfied that the four months timescale proposed in the Bill strikes the correct balance, that it will be possible for the board to decide all but the most exceptional cases within that period.</P>
      <P>Moreover, section 2 (3) provides for circumstances in which it may not be possible or appropriate to determine cases within that four months period. Accordingly, I cannot agree to the Deputies' proposals to increase this period to six months for cases generally. Equally, I am satisfied that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to allow a nine months minimum period for determination of cases involving an environmental impact statement, or EIS, as is proposed in Deputy Garland's amendment No. 10.</P>
      <P>I might add that the effect of Deputy Howlin's amendment would be to exclude any appeal involving an EIS from the four months time objective but would apply to determination of appeals generally, so that effectively, the board would have no timescale in respect of such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>While appeals involving an EIS will be among the more complex ones with which the board will have to deal I do not consider it would be appropriate to proceed in the manner suggested in the Deputy's amendment.  In my view it is preferable to provide that the four months objective should apply to all appeals in the first instance.  In the light of experience, if it emerges that meeting that objective is problematical in cases involving an EIS, because of the complexities involved, consideration could be given at that stage to prescribing, by regulations, under the provisions of sectin 2 (2) (b), for a different objective in such cases.  However, a longer period would be prescribed only if there was compelling evidence that the four months period was unattainable in a particular category of cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin will appreciate that cases involving an EIA very often are those carrying potential for job creation. I am sure he would agree with me that, in the light of the present unemployment problem, the board should not be given a blank cheque in terms of time in such cases.</P>
      <P>In taking into account the overall timescale it is important to incorporate all stages.  First and foremost, an application will be made to a local authority who are obliged to reach a decision on it within two months.  On average, that timescale appears to be spinning out to two and a half months.  When it comes to a question of appeal there is an additional four months after which An Bord Pleanála must take a decision.  If we combine this body of procedures and laws in relation to planning, the minimum period between all these eventualities, in the case of an appeal having been lodged, looks like six and a half months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies appear to be assuming &mdash; I do not know on what they base their assumption &mdash; that a decision which takes seven or eight months is preferable to one that is taken within six months or six and a half months.  In the course of any business in which I have been involved I have never reached the conclusion that somebody who took longer to do a job <Col N="1359" /> necessarily did a better job.  What we are talking about is efficiency.  We are not proposing any restriction in terms of the fundamental rights obtaining but we are seeking efficiency.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 300,000 people unemployed in Ireland and there are many developmental projects.  I have spoken generally to local authorities and An Bord Pleanála about the need to speed up decisions on projects one way or another.  In cases where they grant planning permission a project can proceed, but in cases where they refuse planning permission the possibility is that the developer may go somewhere else and not wait around for something which is not going to happen.  I believe there is a broad fairness in such an approach.  I reject outright the suggestion that a decision which takes nine or ten months or a year to arrive at is potentially a better decision than one arrived at in half that time.  In cases where longer time limits are prescribed I honestly believe that the attention given to that file will go closer to the deadline than the one I am setting &mdash; it is normal practice for people not to take action until they have to take it.  It is important that we look at the broad parameters of what is involved here and get away from the idea that more time is always necessary.</P>
    <P>We should remember that this is 1992. We are talking about a minimum period of six and a half months between the submission of an application and the making of a decision.  This seems to be a reasonable period.  I am prepared to take into account Deputy Howlin's concerns in the light of experience.  I am not trying to ensure that there is not adequate time to make good decisions.  I think we are broadly in agreement that we want to ensure there is adequate time to make good decisions.</P>
    <P>For some extraordinary reason Deputy Garland and I seem to be at loggerheads on the question of resources.  As I said on Second Stage in reply to a question raised in regard to the resources of An Bord Pleanála, the position is entirely different to that presented by Deputies <Col N="1360" /> on the other side of the House in their contributions.  The annual reports of An Bord Pleanála show that they had 59 employees in 1988 and 61 employees in 1989.  To present this as a reduction in resources is not acceptable.  Deputy Gilmore referred to a reduction in the inspectorate.  An Bord Pleanála had 13 inspectors in 1988 and 16 inspectors in 1989.  They also have the power to recruit on a temporary basis, with fee paying arrangements, other inspectors.  Therefore, there can be no doubt that the argument being put forward in regard to a reduction in the resources of An Bord Pleanála is unsustainable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new provisions, I should point out that work which may take somewhat longer to conclude will move off the agenda as these procedures start to work.  Therefore, it should not be necessary to enhance or improve the resources of An Bord Pleanála.  If in the light of experience it is found that provisions in the Bill make it impossible for An Bord Pleanála to make good decisions, I will be the first to have a serious look at what can be done to improve the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin seemed to go out to the corner flag to take a 21 yard free when he had the option of taking it straight in front of the goal when he said that at some future date a Minister may come into the House and say that An Bord Pleanála should be restricted, close them down and expect all the decisions to be made.  I know Deputy Howlin is an able man and he does not really believe what he is saying in this context.  It is like going off the field of play, having your name taken and expecting to come back into the game at another stage.</P>
    <P>Leaving all that aside, to be frank about it there is a certain amount of reasonable opinion on all sides of the House.  I do not want my successor to get my job too soon.  I intend to stay around for a little while.  I am certain that the people who will take our places on these benches will be just as fair and reasonable as we are.  I ask Deputy Howlin to accord to public representatives on all sides a little bit of understanding, to accept that <Col N="1361" /> they are not largely different, that they have the same kind of philosophies in regard to trying to get the job done and that nobody will curtail and deliberately set out to put in place restrictive measures which will prevent a decent job from being done.  I hope the Deputy accepts this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most disappointed at the Minister's response.  Perhaps I did not stress strongly enough when introducing my amendment that I was endeavouring to be consensual in accepting a six month period as against no period, as is the case at present.  We have a completely unlimited regime.  One could make a very strong case for the continuance of this regime.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the reality of the situation.  If An Bord Pleanála take a long time to reach a decision on an appeal it usually means that they are understaffed and underresourced.  This is beyond the control of ordinary people, who have a legitimate right to complain about a particular development.  These people have a legitimate right to a proper system of appeal.  If An Bord Pleanála are under-staffed appeals cannot be processed within a reasonable time.  This is not the fault of An Bord Pleanála or the objector; it is the fault of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no faith whatever in the ability of the Government to use our labour resources properly.  The Minister said there are approximately 300,000 people unemployed in the country and suggested that it was very wrong for An Bord Pleanála to unduly delay industrial projects which could create jobs.  I agree with him on this point.  He said that if An Bord Pleanála took a year to make their decision that the bird would have flown at that stage, even if they came down in favour of the local authority.  Apart from exceptional circumstances one would sympathise with any industrialist who has to wait that length of time for a decision. One way of reducing the number of people on the dole queue is to allow An Bord Pleanála to take on more staff.  This would put an end to the vicious circle of understaffing in An Bord Pleanála and <Col N="1362" /> delays, which in turn mean the cancellation of industrial projects with further job losses.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for us to be businesslike.  Of course, we have to be businesslike and efficient.  If An Bord Pleanála were being run as a business they would be properly staffed and resourced.  If the Government were efficient and businesslike they would ensure that An Bord Pleanála are properly staffed and resourced.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that we arrive at a consensus.  I am disappointed at the response of the Labour Party.  There has been no response good, bad or indifferent from Fine Gael.  It is not clear whether they are in favour of or against the proposal; they are totally mute. Deputy Gilmore and I have made a very eloquent case for a six month period for ordinary appeals.  As a compromise, and to avoid a possible waste of time on a vote, would the Minister accept a five month period?  My amendment No. 10 deals with environmental impact statements. Deputy Howlin's amendment No. 8 is somewhat similar to my amendment, but he does not propose any time limit. If the Minister was prepared to give a little on this point I would be prepared to consider a time limit of eight months rather than nine months.  We are anxious to compromise and to be reasonable, not to be confrontational.  However, since the debate started there has been confrontation and stonewalling, there is no &ldquo;give&rdquo; from the Minister.  His response to the debate on these amendments has been identical; &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; seems to be his motto.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to work towards a consensus and if the vast bulk of planning appeals are, <i>de facto,</i> within a four month period it is a reasonable yardstick for the majority of appeals.  We only need a look at a tiny minority and we need not be concerned about open-ended decisions.  Appeals are usually decided within four months.  However, I am still concerned about the mechanism for having a proper environmental impact statement drawn up.  I have been <Col N="1363" /> advised that the four months' timeframe is too tight to do that effectively.  As I said, the four months general provision applies to a small category of applications which, generally, arouse most public interest and concern.  The Minister should now exclude them from the provisions of the four months term and if he feels he does not want to leave it open-ended &mdash; which is the current practice in law &mdash; he should put his own timeframe under subsection (b).  This would solve the problem as long as the time limit is greater than four months and allows a proper environmental impact statement to be drawn up and processed.  That is a very reasonable request, accepting the general thrust of the Bill to apply justice to an appellant from the development side or an appellant from the environmental side, although I do not necessarily juxtapose them as opponents in every case.  Both sides need a decision within a reasonable time as long as proper consideration has been given to all the issues. If we include a timeframe of four months for development or appeals which include an environmental impact statement, justice will not be served.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to meet me on this point.  If he does he will generate goodwill, not only in this House, but across the country because of his sincerity in having efficiency coupled with proper planning and environmental considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest Deputy Garland is under the illusion that this side of the House do not have anything to say in regard to this matter, I must inform him that our proposals are quite different from his.  As a Member I am frequently asked to make representations about long delays in regard to planning decisions.  If four months is the time laid down in relation to An Bord Pleanála, there will be delays, despite the impression given that this legislation will give rise to greater efficiency.  We considered tabling an amendment specifying a shorter period than four months which would be challenging for the Minister. <Col N="1364" /> However, on mature reflection, we decided not to.</P>
      <P>Environmental impact statements is an area in which more and more expertise will be called on to give judgment in regard to various matters.  Laying out what will be required in such statements will determine the time taken.  While I appreciate what Deputy Howlin is trying to get the Minister to agree to, to a certain extent the judgment on the efficiency or the output in this case will depend on the guidelines laid down for environmental impact statements and the work done on them.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not state what will happen regarding the improvement of environmental impact statements.  At present there is great confusion in my constituency regarding the quality of an environmental impact statement commissioned by a Department of State. They laid down comprehensive guidelines, it was carried out efficiently within the timeframe to which Deputy Howlin referred but it has not satisfied the people for or against it.  There will always be controversy in this area.  A time factor of the order Deputy Garland suggested would give rise to extreme situations being made more extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not really made a case for the four months limit, indeed the case made by the Government side on this issue shows how unsure the Minister is about the four months limit.  Deputy Callely argued much the same case which I argued, that these limits could not be applied unless sufficient resources were provided.  He asked a very interesting question &mdash; to which the Minister has not replied &mdash; whether he would provide additional resources for An Bord Pleanála to enable them to comply with the time limits in the legislation.  I repeat the invitation which Deputy Callely extended to the Minister to comment on that aspect of the legislation, particularly in the light of the statement in the explanatory memorandum that no additional staffing or financial requirements will be provided <Col N="1365" /> for An Bord Pleanála as a result of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to be a bit unsure as to whether four months is the right period of time.  As he pointed out, he has made an additional provision in the Bill that if it does not work out he can change it by way of regulation.  He asked us to wait and see how it works out.  It is almost 30 years since the Planning Act, 1963, came into force.  Surely there is enough experience at this stage in relation to the processing of planning applications for the Minister to know with certainty the position in relation to planning decisions? He should not have to wait for a further period to allow this provision by way of regulations to change the four months if it is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that when there is a time limit there is a tendency for all decisions to gravitate towards the limit and that even if the limit is four months, decisions which could be made in two months might not be made until coming up to the expiry of the fourth month.  It is a fair point.  We had a fairly extensive debate on this and, on reflection, since there does not appear to be a great deal of support in the House for the formula which Deputy Garland and I proposed, to extend the limit from four to six months, I think the House should now support the formula proposed by Deputy Howlin.  He suggested that in cases where the appeal includes an environmental impact statement, the board should not be confined to the four months period because it is more likely to be a complex appeal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin asked the Minister to accept his amendment or at the very least to give it serious consideration before Report Stage.  I support that request and if the Minister is not disposed to acceding to it I will withdraw amendment No. 7 in favour of Deputy Howlin's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>First, on the specific question of delays, I dealt with this matter comprehensively earlier.  I refuted the accusations that the board had reduced resources in the year 1988-89.  Since then negotiations on staffing levels have <Col N="1366" /> always been reviewed on the most generous terms.  All the facts available to me indicate that the resources are sufficient for An Bord Pleanála to deal expeditiously and in a fair and balanced way with the appeals before them. Deputy Carey asked about the reasons for delays.  When we had introduced improvements in relation to staffing and other matters, we discovered there were cumbersome legal imperatives in the board's existing obligations which made it practically impossible for them to reach decisions in a reasonable time.  We set out to eliminate the ping pong circulation of documents.  To ensure the appeal could be dealt with more expeditiously, we placed an obligation on appellants to submit all the details within the time prescribed and we allowed an extra week for this.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the matter raised in Deputy Howlin's amendment.  I am satisfied that the four month period is satisfactory and that it is sufficient to enable the board to make their decision in almost all cases. Section 2 (3) caters for cases when the board are unable to make a decision within the period: they will inform the appellant of the position and indicate the time scale in which they will make their decision.  I indicated to Deputy Howlin that if the environmental impact assessment throws up certain complications which make it difficult for An Bord Pleanála to make their decision within the prescribed limits, I am prepared to look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies seem to think that everything about a planning appeal starts the day it reaches An Bord Pleanála.  However, in almost all cases the environmental impact statement is available when the application is being processed by the local authority.  It has come to my notice that only in a handful of cases are environmental impact statements lodged with the appeal.  We must put the matter in context. The planning application is first processed by the local authority, an environmental impact assessment may be carried out and this is submitted when the decision is appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  If Deputies take that into <Col N="1367" /> account, they will understand that fair and reasonable time is available for the board to make their decision.  However, in certain complex cases, I am prepared to look at the time limit.  If the board are not in a position to make a decision within the prescribed time they have the facility to inform the applicant, as I outlined.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8a:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), lines 3 to 5, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points I would like to make on this amendment, the first of which is that we have to ask ourselves whether we are wasting our time coming into the House to address key sections of the legislation if we find there is a little clause in the Bill which will enable the Minister to change it if he so wishes.  This would seem to undermine the concept behind what the House is doing, that is, legislating. We have had a long debate on whether the time limit should be four months or six months and whether provision should be made for environmental impact assessments and so on.  Having had that debate and having confirmed after a vote that the time limit will be four months, we are now dealing with a subsection which states, effectively, that if the Minister is not happy with the limit of four months he can change it in respect of all categories or for particular classes of planning applications only.  This flies in the face of the pretence that it is this House that decides on these issues.  There is not much point in introducing legislation which states that the time limit will be four months and then allowing the Minister, if he so wishes, to shorten the time limit in respect of particular classes of planning applications.  I do not think <Col N="1370" /> such a provision should be included because this House should make the legislation.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made already to the idea of secondary legislation, that is, regulations.  The difficulty about these is that we never get an opportunity to debate the details in this House.  Indeed, if we try to raise the issue on the Order of Business we are ruled out of order. Very often the substance of the legislation is contained in the regulations but, as I said, we never get around to debating them.  This makes a mockery out of what we are doing.  Even though we have just decided that the time limit will be four months, the provision we are now debating states that if the Minister does not like the figure of four months he will be able to change it.  If we are going to pass legislation such as that we might as well pass it from the beginning; but let us stop pretending we have decided that the time limit will be four months when what we are actually doing is writing a blank cheque for the Minister who will be able to decide that the figure will be whatever he wants it to be.</P>

      <P>While my amendment, amendment No. 9, is along somewhat similar lines to amendment No. 8a it may possibly be better in so far as I am seeking to have the word &ldquo;longer&rdquo; inserted before the word &ldquo;period&rdquo;.  Paragraph (b) states &ldquo;such other period as the Minister may prescribe&rdquo; either in respect of all classes or a particular class of planning appeal.  Deputy Gilmore has stated very eloquently that this paragraph is a sham and a facade as it stands.  Therefore we could do one of two things.  We could either delete it altogether &mdash; I would agree with this &mdash; or, better still, the Minister, who may have the best of intentions, may state in reply that what he has in mind is a longer period.  About six weeks ago the Minister received representations from An Taisce, which I assume he has read.  Even though he has no intention of accepting the amendment, we will give him one last chance to <Col N="1371" /> include the word &ldquo;longer&rdquo; which, and I am sure Deputy Gilmore would agree, would be acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken at some length about my constant difficulties with clauses such as this which allow a Minister to circumvent the intentions of the Oireachtas.  I raise this issue each time legislation is discussed.  More and more the meat of legislation is decided not by the House but by the civil servants and it is then signed into law by Ministers acting on foot of enabling provisions.  This is wrong and anti-democratic.  While a series of regulations are usually required on foot of complex legislation, having regard to the rate at which this is being done the democratic authority of this House is being undermined.  I have stated many times in the House that this is wrong as a principle, and I think I am well known for this.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment, I have a slight difficulty with it in the sense that I have sought to ensure the exclusion of certain categories in respect of the four month rule.  Having regard to the vote we have just had, this cannot now be done in the primary legislation and I have to fall back on secondary legislation as the only way in which it can be done.  I hope the Minister will make provision in regulations for the exclusion of complex appeals, which involve environmental impact statements, from the four month rule.  For this reason I am minded to support the amendment in the name of Deputy Garland which would give the Minister the power to alter the time limit; however, he would only be allowed to extend it.  That would be a desirable objective and I hope the Minister will accept Deputy Garland's amendment, which I support.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 8a would take away the Minister's power to specify a period other than four months for the determination of appeals or other matters by the board.  The period of four months for deciding cases was selected after careful consideration.  I am satisfied <Col N="1372" /> that it is appropriate for cases generally and that it strikes the necessary balance between the need for speedy decisions and a fair and thorough examination of issues coming before the board.  Nevertheless, it may prove appropriate in the light of experience to specify a different period for particular cases.</P>
      <P>For example, as Deputy Mitchell and others have suggested in other amendments, a shorter target period might be possible in the case of appeals dealing with a routine development which does not raise complex planning issues.  I view section 2 (2) (b) as providing a necessary element of flexibility and consider that it should be retained.  I cannot therefore accept the amendment or the related amendments, amendments Nos. 11a and 13a.  I can however assure Deputy Gilmore that any change to the four month period would be contemplated only in the light of adequate experience of the operation of that period.</P>
      <P>I consider also that amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy Garland, which would limit the Minister to prescribing alternative time objectives of longer than four months for the determination of cases, would be unduly restrictive.  It is desirable that the power to prescribe a period other than four months should be framed so as to allow the Minister to provide for both shorter and longer periods. I cannot therefore agree to Deputy Garland's amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that there is anything unacceptable in principle in giving the Minister power to set an alternative to the four month period by way of regulations. Even though it is my clear intention at this stage that the four month period will apply to all cases, it may emerge when we have gained experience of the operation of that period that a somewhat different period could appropriately be applied in certain cases.  It would not be appropriate to have recourse to primary legislation to make an adjustment to that period.  On that basis I consider that there is a very strong case for ministerial power such as that proposed in section 2 (2) (b).</P>

    <P>I know Deputy Howlin has a very contentious view about the need to enshrine <Col N="1373" /> almost everything in primary legislation. There is much to be said for that ideal but it would not be practical and has never been the practice of this House. We would end up with a very much longer gestation period in terms of what happens in this House, and Heaven knows we are already in great difficulty with regard to the length of time it takes to pass legislation here, even legislation that is extremely urgent.</P>

      <P>The second point is that when there is an emergency the immediate suggestion is to introduce legislation.  Very often I have thought, as a politician and not as a Minister, that under the existing legislative framework, which might not be able to deal with a particular situation, we should have the flexibility to deal with situations without all the time returning to primary legislation.  I do not see that as negating democracy or as an interference with Deputies' rights to represent the people.  I would like to see a situation where we could deal with problems on a regulatory basis and meet the needs of society more quickly.  To go the other road and enshrine everything in primary legislation would not be feasible.  What we are doing here is creating flexibility so that after a period of time planning applications which are straightforward can be dealt with within the prescribed timelimit and we can adjust for complex cases that cannot be dealt with in a short time.</P>

      <P>I am a little puzzled by Deputy Garland's amendment.  It seems to run counter to his preceding amendment where he was seeking to have the word &ldquo;longer&rdquo; inserted.  Here we are giving the board the option in difficult cases to take a longer time.  If this subsection was deleted it would have the opposite effect to that intended by Deputy Garland.  On reflection, Deputy Garland may wish to withdraw the amendment.  It seems that in complex planning applications it would be only appropriate that the board would be able to take longer than the four months.</P>

      <P>You are forgiven, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I see a difficulty with Deputy Garland's amendment.  What I seek to do is to extend the time and subsequent times if that is required.  The import of my amendment No. 12 is to make the new subsection read:</P>
      <P>Where a notice has been served under paragraph (a), the Board shall take all such steps as are open to it to ensure that the appeal or other matter is determined before the date specified in the notice, but if this is not possible the Board may from time to time by notice extend the period concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It would not then simply be a once-off process.  If an extremely complex issue was not determined, even in the extended time notified to the parties, the import of what is currently in place would mean that there would be pressure to have it decided within the new timeframe.  I am allowing the flexibility to further broaden the timescale in a particularly difficult case where the board is minded to give extra time.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Garland's proposal to remove subsection (3) of section 2.  The subsection is essential <Col N="1376" /> as it lays down the procedures which the board must follow if, in a particular case, it is not possible or appropriate for them to meet the time objective under section 2 (2).  If the provision was deleted, the procedure in circumstances where the board are unable, for bona fide reasons, to give their decision within four months would be unacceptably uncertain.</P>
      <P>A provision along the lines of subsection (3) is essential where there will be a statutory objective, rather than an absolute time limit, for the determination of cases by the board.  It could only be dispensed with, if there was an absolute requirement to decide cases within a specified period.  However, absolute time limits would be problematical in legal terms, given the board's obligations as a quasi-judicial body to observe the requirements of natural and constitutional justice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin's proposal raises the possibility that the board might serve a series of notices indicating dates by which they intend to determine a particular case.  I consider that such a situation would be intolerable.  The board will be expected to determine all but the most exceptional cases within the four month period indicated in section 2 (2) of the Bill, and to have recourse to the power under section 2 (3) as infrequently as possible.</P>
      <P>If the board avail of the power under section 2 (3), the clear expectation is that they will then determine the case in question by the date that they indicate to the parties.  To provide for a succession of notices indicating different target dates effectively gives the Board an open cheque in terms of time.  This runs totally counter to the whole purpose of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I cannot, therefore, agree to these amendments.</P>

I accept the Minister's point, but there is validity in Deputy Howlin's amendment.  I can see complex circumstances in which it would be necessary or desirable in the public interest to have a second or subsequent extension as provided for in Deputy Howlin's amendment.  On the other hand it would be undesirable for the board to have a <i>carte blanche</i> to extend the time limit.  Perhaps we could reach a compromise on Report Stage by taking the substance of Deputy Howlin's amendment and stipulating that the board would only have an extension with the consent of the Minister, in exceptional circumstances. Will the Minister consider that?</P>

      <P>It is conceivable that there could be a complex planning appeal going on.  The most complex case ever to come before Wexford County Council was in relation to a nuclear power station.  One can imagine the process of appeals going through a planning application such as that.  It would be wrong if the shutters came down on exceptional planning applications and excluded a movement on the time limit.  If at the end of four months An Bord Pleanála are not in a position to make a decision, they then have to set a new date and if they cannot reach a decision on that date, it is `tough cookies&rdquo; as far as the Minister is concerned. That is not good planning.  I accept the caveat being entered by Deputy Mitchell in that an extension might require the support of the Minister. I would not oppose that, but the Minister should consider this on Report Stage.</P>

At the end of the four month period what exactly is involved should be fairly clear.

Deputy Mitchell will appreciate on reconsidering his proposal for Ministerial intervention, that An Bord Pleanála are a statutory independent authority and the Minister should not be involved in this way.

      <P>This is a very important point.  There will be times when a decision cannot be made after four months and new goal posts will have to be put in place by the appeals board. They might consider that they will have all the technical data assessed in six weeks or two months.  However, the Minister is saying that they will not be allowed a further extension, so the board will be inclined to ask for six months rather than two in case they cannot finish the work within two months.  To allow flexibility will work towards efficiency in the board. If the Minister accepts the mechanism I am suggesting, the board can agree to try to have the work done within a month, but if it is not completed by then they will be able to extend the time by a further month.  This would be efficient and it <Col N="1379" /> would only be brought into play in exceptional circumstances.  It is disingenuous for the Minister to suggest that if he accepts this, An Bord Pleanála will consider it as a vehicle so as to run a coach and four through the intentions of the Oireachtas.  It is unfair to An Bord Pleanála to imply that they will do that. They want to act as expeditiously as they can.  My amendment takes into account the view that whatever decisions we make must be mindful of proper planning and environmental considerations.  The mechanism I am proposing to the Minister is a very good one to balance the requirements of efficiency, good planning and environmental considerations. The Minister is blind if he cannot see that.</P>

The parties to the appeal may be in dispute in the courts as to, for instance, the ownership of the property.  That may not be resolved within the timescale.  It would be sensible to make provision, as suggested by Deputy Howlin, for a further extension, but only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister is making the point that An Bord Pleanála is a statutory body independent of the Minister.  It is provided throughout the Bill that the Minister may make regulations and stipulate requirements.  Section 18 (1) (b) provides that the Minister may by regulations make such provisions as regards procedure in respect of other matters with which the board is concerned as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient.

The power under section 2 (4) is a reserved one to be used only in exceptional circumstances where disruption of the board's operation, caused, for example, by a postal strike, would make it impossible for the board to comply with the four month objective for determining cases.

      <P>What worries me about the transitional arrangement is that the explanatory memorandum states very clearly that this Bill will not entail any extra charge on the Exchequer.  That implies that extra staff will not be taken on by An Bord Pleanála to deal with this backlog of work.  The workload will remain the same but the period in which that work has to be processed will be changed.  The whole timescale of the operation will completely change.  Fresh applications will have to be dealt with within the four month period.  This will require an immense speed up and there is a real risk that appeals already lodged will be put on the back burner because of the need to deal with current applications. <Col N="1382" /> Has the Minister thought this through?  There will be quite severe transitional difficulties if the present level of appeals continues.  He should not hamstring himself by limiting the transitional period to six months.  This is long term legislation.  Let us give the board a reasonable time to get their affairs in order.  I suggest 12 months.  Six months is not long enough.  We cannot say what level of appeals there will be over the next few months but that level will decide how quickly the backlog can be cleared.

      <P>As it stands, section 2 (6) provides that the time objective of four months for the determination of cases will apply to appeals and other matters received by An Bord Pleanála on or after the date which is six months after the date of the passing of the Act.  This transitional period of six months will give the board ample time to gear up their operations for the new procedures proposed in the Bill and to meet the new time objective of four months for determining cases.  It would also give the board sufficient opportunity to dispose of cases on hands when the Bill is passed.  The number of cases on hands in the board has been reduced greatly over the past 18 months, and I am confident that the six months is adequate.  Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Deputy's proposal that there be an interval of 12 months before the new time for deciding cases would apply.  I would like to add that all stages of this Bill will, hopefully, pass some time in the summer, which will be more than six months from the time the Bill first appeared.  Everybody in An Bord Pleanála and in the country as a whole is alerted to and aware of many of the provisions involved in streamlining these procedures because they have been debated in the national news media.</P>

      <P>The general provisions are well known to the people whom Deputy Howlin and Deputy Garland seek to protect in this amendment.  I doubt if people working in An Bord Pleanála are unaware of what is happening in the Oireachtas in terms of streamlining planning procedures, laws and regulations.  I am meeting Deputy Garland's proposal by allowing for six months after the passage of the Bill, which will be in a couple of months' time.  The very essence of what is involved in the Bill has been well known to An Bord Pleanála for months.</P>
      <P>The questions of resources has been raised.  Deputy Garland seems to be of the view that there is no way planning appeal procedures can be streamlined and new laws and regulations introduced governing these procedures without providing additional staff.  Many of the existing and more cumbersome methods of dealing with applications are being reshaped in a more progressive way.  To give one instance, there will be an obligation on the board to request the appellant to submit the appeal and the onus will be on the appellant to complete the deliberations and make the appeal comprehensively.  There are other areas in which the work of An Bord Pleanála will be assisted by the new procedures. However, if in the light of experience there is an indication that the resources of An Bord Pleanála are insufficient to meet the number of appeals lodged, as I have said, I will be the first to see to what extent I can deal with that matter.</P>

      <P>I find the Minister's contribution quite curious.  He says that those of us who are proposing this amendment seek to protect the staff of An Bord Pleanála.  He goes on to state that the contents of the Bill have been known to the staff of An Bord Pleanála since last November.  I cannot help but get the feeling from this whole debate, particularly from the Minister's last contribution, that he thinks the delays in the planning appeals system are the fault of the staff of An Bord Pleanála.  Does he imagine that the staff are waiting for the passage of this legislation to make <Col N="1384" /> them perk up and get on with the processing of appeals?  That is the message that comes across from the Minister's contribution.  I had not expected that this amendment would produce this revelation. The tabling of the amendment had nothing to do with the staff of An Bord Pleanála but was simply to recognise the fact that the whole appeals procedure will change quite significantly with the passage of this legislation.  There will be a new method of lodging appeals, a new system for the seeking and processing of observations on appeals and for allowing applicants and third parties an opportunity to rebut the argument of the other side.  For the first time ever a time limit will have to be met in relation to planning appeals.</P>
      <P>Recently I spoke to a person with many years' experience in working in a local authority planning department who talked about the two month limit, particularly the arrangements in this country whereby if a decision is not made by the expiry of the two months the application is deemed to be approved, whereas in other countries if the decision is not made within the time limit the application is deemed not to be approved.  That means that every day there is a crisis because you must see what dates have been met and so on.  We are now putting the same obligation on An Bord Pleanála, thereby adding to the pressure on them.  I do not believe it will be possible to change over to this new procedure within six months. A longer lead-in period will be necessary because of the major changes in procedure. It is quite wrong of the Minister to convey the impression in this House that the delays in the planning appeals system are the fault of the staff of An Bord Pleanála, and I hope he will clarify the position.</P>

      <P>Tá sé soiléir gur deacrachtaí móra iad.  Could I say, a Chathaoirligh, that I clearly have extreme difficulty with the English language and that it seems necessary to speak in Irish.  In some extraordinary way, Deputy Gilmore has interpreted what I said as reflecting on the officials and technical staff of An Bord Pleanála. What I clearly said was that there were procedures in the old system which we are streamlining in the context of new laws and regulations.  These procedures placed on the board a burden which I am removing.  I went into specific detail on just one aspect of the matter to clarify what I was saying.  Once the Bill is enacted and the six-month period has expired, An Bord Pleanála will have the best possible opportunity to prepare for the new demands that will be made on them.  That should not be interpreted as a reflection on the staff of the Department of the Environment who, as I said in the course of my earlier contribution, have, following discussions with them, been able to make dramatic improvements in the past 18 months in all areas and solve many of the problems that had been raised up to that time.  Once they had been removed it was crystal clear that the cumbersome nature of the obligations under planning appeals had to be taken on board, which is what is being done. The highly qualified and motivated people involved had sufficient time to gear themselves to meet new challenges. It is six or seven months since the Bill was presented to the House and a further six months will be available after the enactment of the legislation.  That should be sufficient time to prepare to meet the challanges.  Following voting today in the British general election, the UK could have a new Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Where An Bord Pleanála cause an inspector's report to be produced in relation to an application for planning permission, such report shall be published and copies shall be made available at the offices of the local authority in whose functional area the site which is the subject of the application is situated.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, in the names of Deputies Carey, Allen and myself, seeks to include a new subsection, which will require the board to publish and make available at the offices of the local authority concerned an inspector's report in relation to any planning application on appeal.  Those who have an interest in the appeal should have access to the report.  To date the reports are not made generally available and there is no justification, in an open society, for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's response to this amendment.  Is there any good reason a report, even a report commissioned in particular circumstances, should not be made available?  It is only <Col N="1387" /> right that inspector's reports be made available to the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Minister can convince me that there is a measure in existing legislation that would render this provision unnecessary, I will support the amendment very strongly.  The amendment relates to a very important point of freedom of information, something that we are not very good at here.  There is little information available in relation to much legislation.  That is true in regard to planning.</P>
      <P>Members may recall the recent notorious case of the Tara Radio mast, when An Bord Pleanála allowed the retention of a ghastly and unauthorised development. It emerged, accidently, that An Bord Pleanála had acted against the advice contained in the inspector's report.  Until that was revealed the general public assumed, naturally, that the inspector had recommended acceptance. In fact, the inspector recommended the exact opposite.  We should move away from secretive planning of that kind.  It should be open to the public to examine these matters to ensure everything is completely above board, if Members will excuse the unintentional pun.  I strongly support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I address the major question posed in the amendment I wish to say, as a former member of a local authority, that I hope it will always be possible for a county manager to make a planning decision that may be different from the one prescribed in a technical planning officer's recommendation. While a county manager may accept such a recommendation in the vast majority of cases, it is clear he or she must have the discretion to adopt a different approach. From my experience, one should not always have to rigidly adhere to the content of a technical recommendation.  No Deputy would wish that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 23 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, a person appointed by An Bord Pleanála to carry out an inspection or an <Col N="1388" /> oral hearing on behalf of the board must make a written report to the board on the inspection or hearing and must include in that report a recommendation relating to the matter with which the inspection or hearing was concerned.  The board must in turn consider that report and recommendation before determining the matter to which the report relates.  The board are not, however, bound by the inspector's report.  Determination of the appeal is a matter for the members of the board, who must do so in accordance with the procedures and by reference to the considerations laid down by the planning acts.  While members of the board must obviously give careful consideration to the inspector's report, it will be open to them to arrive at a different conclusion on the basis of the evidence before them. Since the inspector's report is, in the final analysis, only an input into the board's determination of an appeal, I do not consider that it is necessary or appropriate to require the public availability of such reports.</P>
    <P>The Deputies' amendment may reflect the position that pertains in the UK. There the inspector's report must be made available.  However, there is an important difference between the appeals system here and that in the UK. In Britain it is the inspector who decides the appeal, except exceptional ones called in by the Environmental Secretary. In Ireland the board make the decision and must incorporte the reasons for it in their decision.  For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the Minister's response.  I do not see why the inspector's report should not be made available.  It is not good enough for the Minister to use the UK procedure because our position is somewhat different to theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do agree with the Minister that in the determination of a planning application a county manager or city manager should not necessarily be bound by the recommendations of his or her technical officials.  Of course the manager has to have the ultimate say in deciding planning <Col N="1389" /> applications and need not necessarily be bound by technical reports. Likewise, I consider that An Bord Pleanála need not necessarily be bound to the strict recommendations of their own inspectors.  If that were the case we would not need a board.</P>
    <P>There is an overwhelming case for the public to have the right to know what was contained in the inspector's report, what arguments were made, what considerations appeared in the inspector's report and the conclusions of that report. I really feel there is no good reason that this inspectors' report should not be published. I urge the Minister to reconsider his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very important principle involved in this amendment.  I take the point that a county manager or the board of An Bord Pleanála need not necessarily act on either the report of the inspector, in the case of An Bord Pleanála, or the planning officials or other technical staff in the case of a local authority.  But I feel very strongly that those reports should be publicly available. No matter who may be the official, whether he is an official of An Bord Pleanála, or it is the manager of a local authority, there must be some degree of accountability.  At the very least the public are entitled to have access to these technical reports.  There obtains within our planning system here two sets of files, one set available to the public in local authorities and another file under the counter.  The one under the counter is the one that contains perhaps the most significant information of all, that is the technical reports of the planning officers, the reports of the roads engineers and all the rest, which has never been made available either to the public or to the elected members of local authorities.  The same applies here in relation to An Bord Pleanála in that inspectors' reports will not be available.  I contend that gives rise to a great deal of public suspicion about some decisions taken by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very late in this debate.  I do not want to go into some of the recent difficulties, <Col N="1390" /> controversies and so on surrounding An Bord Pleanála.  But I contend it invites public suspicion when the basic technical information, the reports of professionals on which decisions are taken, are not made available to the public.  That is an important principle to be underscored.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the time remaining. As this may be the last occasion I shall have an opportunity of contributing to this debate I want to repeat something I said on Second Stage, that is that I consider this Bill is seriously flawed.  I had hoped that, on Committee Stage, we would have had an opportunity to amend it in a manner that would have rendered it acceptable to me and my party.  Unfortunately, that has not been possible because of the short length of time afforded us, when we are still only on amendment No. 15 to section 2 of a Bill that runs to 22 sections.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I regret that, when the question is put at 2.30 p.m.  I will be unable to support this Bill on Committee Stage.  I will be opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not contribute to this amendment, since I contributed to virtually every other one.  I did not want my remarks to be misconstrued.  I strongly support this amendment in that I consider there is a compelling case for the information sought by Deputies to be published.  I am not at all conviced by the Minister's argument in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been concerned, as we have progressed through Committee Stage, that the overriding principle the Minister wants to enshrine in this Bill is one of &ldquo;get the planning permissions through as expeditiously as possible&rdquo;.  Quite frankly, I am not at all convinced by his attitude here that he is willing to allow the proper planning and environmental considerations to have co-equal status with the need for expedition.  I am very fearful that this will be a very bad Bill.  I, too, will be opposing it on Committee Stage. Certainly the Minister is not minded to accept a raft of very reasonable amendments which would achieve the purpose the Minister said on Second Stage he <Col N="1391" /> wished to bring about, that is the rational handling of planning appeals in an expeditious manner.  I strongly share that view, but there is a need for checks and balances to be inserted in the Bill.  I greatly regret that these are not being accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>He has an opportunity to accept this amendment with which we are dealing before the remaining six minutes tick away and before his bona fides in relation to striking the balance required will be brought into question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the two previous speakers, I should like to place on record my opposition to this Bill, indeed my utter disappointment with the Minister's response to our amendments, most of which were extremely reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long debate on Second Stage and I was very heartened then by the contributions from all sides of the House which clearly indicated general acceptance of the broad principles enshrined in the Bill.  To avail of the opportunity now, at the end of Committee Stage, to place on record outright opposition to provisions which have been supported in a general way seems to me to be not the most desirable way to conduct business.  However, that is all right. If you like, I can be represented, as somebody who is unwilling to listen or, on the other hand, as somebody who is prepared to enact legislation which is workable and practical and the provisions of which would remedy the position obtaining without tearing apart and rendering worthless some of the provisions contained in it, or having them substituted by new ones which run totally counter to its main provisions.  A number of amendments have been tabled which ran directly counter to previous ones tabled by the same Deputies.  I did not place that on the record before but I do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential matter enshrined in this amendment is that we make provision for the publication of the inspector's report. I have said that the inspector's input is one aspect only of the total arrangements <Col N="1392" /> which combine until eventually the point is reached at which An Bord Pleanála take a decision.  When An Bord Pleanála have taken a decision, then we are talking about whether an inspector's report should be published.  An Bord Pleanála have taken their decision.  Nothing that may happen of which I can think will in the normal way change that decision unless, of course, there is a court sequel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes the decision transparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a moment, unless there is a court sequel in which context, of course, all documents are open to scrutiny. Therefore, the kind of transparency the Deputy seeks takes the matter to a point of pressing for publication of an inspector's report which forms one part only of the combination of different aspects encompassed in a decision of An Bord Pleanála.  I do not know how helpful it would be to provide in legislation that an inspector's report should be published subsequent to a decision taken by An Bord Pleanála since it would not change anything at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall, the Minister has been less than forthcoming in his dealing with this Bill.  The manner in which he has succeeded in ramming through Committee Stage, without consultation, means that this is the second Bill with which he has dealt within his short time as Minister for the Environment, since the Control of Dogs Bill was dealt with in a similar manner on Second Stage.  If the Minister wishes to treat the House like that he will be treated in like manner.  However, that is for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be my hope that we would have a more constructive debate on Report Stage, with a more forthcoming attitude on the part of the Minister, whose attitude so far as been deplorable. From my experience as a Minister I know there are two types of Ministers: the one who is in charge of his brief, who is confident, who comes into the House with legislation, accepting that its processing <Col N="1393" /> through both Houses of the Oireachtas is a process laid down in our Constitution in order to improve and perfect legislation and, on the other hand, there are some Ministers who come into the House determined not to accept any change whatsoever because they believe they know all.  The Minister does not know all.</P>
    <P>I accept the general principle of this Bill, which is to streamline the timescale within which planning decisions can be taken without taking shortcuts over people's rights.  I am worried about any short-cutting.  I am also very worried about the lack of accountability on the part of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>My amendment requests that an inspector's report be published, a simple request, which is the practice in the United Kingdom and in many other administrations.  Yet the Minister will not accede to that simple request.  I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted it but it is something we can discuss at greater length and in greater detail on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform the House that there are certain other amendments to which I am favourably disposed.  I am referring in particular to amendments Nos. 33 and 65 in the name of Deputy Howlin.  I wish to inform Deputies that I intend to give further careful consideration to the issues raised <Col N="1394" /> in these amendments between now and Report Stage.  I am also considering the changes which may be necessary to section 8 to clarify the start of the period for persons other than parties to make submissions in cases where a number of appeals are made to the board about the one development.  I may return to this matter also on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 1, 47, 63 and 93 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are 10,670 public house licences issued; a fee of £100 is payable in respect of each licence, irrespective of turnover or location.  I consider it wholly appropriate to seek a fair return for the State in respect of the benefits and opportunities arising from the highly restricted issue of liquor licences.  This is particularly the case when the restrained Government approach to alcohol taxation in recent years, in recognition of the impending EC Internal Market, has resulted in the proportion of retail drink prices accounted for by tax falling significantly and the tax content of drink declining in real terms.  These considerations and general budgetary needs prompted me to look for a contribution to the Exchequer from the drinks trade by way of an increase in the licence fee, which was last adjusted in 1989.  My budgetary proposals are aimed at raising an additional £3 million in a full year. I was anxious to ensure that whatever approach was adopted in that regard should as far as was practicable relate more closely to turnover.  I was also concerned to ensure that all types of liquor licences were treated fairly and equitably, having regard to the different nature, conditions and scope of the various <Col N="1398" /> types of licences.  As far as public houses and hotels were concerned, an approach based on the rateable valuation of the individual premises concerned, but differentiated by rate chargeable to take account of the different nature of the core businesses involved, appeared to offer an appropriate mechanism.</P>
    <P>In the contacts which I have had subsequently with vintners' representatives, illustrative figures have been mentioned and I have listened carefully to the various reactions and will bear them in mind when framing the final Finance Bill proposals. Let me again emphasise that my primary objective is to raise the necessary amount of revenue by the fairest possible means.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that my objective can be met in a way which should not be unduly onerous on publicans.  In any event the new charges will be deductible as a trading expense for income tax or corporation tax purposes, as appropriate, and the net additional cost of the licence will therefore be ameliorated to a large extent in most cases.  As a consequence, there should be no adverse effect on the job targets in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Indeed, as this initiative is part of the general broadening of the taxation base, it is entirely consistent with the wider Government objective of reforming income tax as a means of promoting much needed employment growth.</P>

      <P>As I said before, I have not very fixed views on the basis of how I will raise the money but the licensed trade have differing views.  A large proportion of the licensed trade would like to see it based on the rateable valuation, while others would like to see it based on turnover.  My principal concern is to try to maintain a fair share of State revenue from the drinks trade.  The trade element in price is dropping and because of the reduction in excise and VAT, the percentage return on drink fell by approximately 6 per cent and the return on beer dropped by 7 per cent.  I am seeking to get an equitable share by whatever means I can.  The licence is a very saleable asset. Recently licences sold for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, I am bearing <Col N="1402" /> in mind the case made in the representations to see how this can be dealt with.  I do not accept that this is a punitive measure.  The co-operatives are economic entities.  Apart from the co-operatives who are now public limited companies, many others are very substantial traders in the market place.  We all want to see that.  I do not think Members want to see a company who can make substantial profits being exempt from corporation tax.  At the same time, I agree that to move from a zero rate of tax to a 40 per cent rate of tax, especially in the case of small co-operatives, is difficult, particularly when the larger co-operatives pay tax at the rate of 10 per cent.  I am particularly concerned about co-operatives who are not engaged in manufacturing or processing but who collect the raw material for another co-operative who process it and pay tax at the rate of 10 per cent while the co-op engaged in the preparatory work would have to pay a higher rate of tax.  I am looking at this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 74 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from employers, employees and from various representative bodies about the changes which I announced in the budget in relation to the taxation of the benefit from the availability for private use of company cars.  I have met with some of these groups and my officials have met others.  I have, of course, been responding to these representations and will continue to do so as I receive them.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will appreciate that this aspect of income tax cannot be seen in isolation from the totality of the measures taken in the income tax area in the budget &mdash; both their underlying rationale and the fact that the budget effected substantial mainsteam income tax reliefs &mdash; which will benefit taxpayers to the extent of £168 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current rates of taxable benefit &mdash;<Col N="1405" /> 20 per cent of original market value where all the costs are met by the employer, falling to 12½ per cent where the car only is provided &mdash; are very lenient when compared with the costs of private ownership.  When the sliding scale was originally introduced in 1982 it was intended that these rates would double to 40 per cent and 25 per cent for 1983-84 and subsequent years, but this change never took place.  There is no doubt that the annual cost to an individual of providing and running a new car is over 40 per cent of the purchase price.  This being the case, the increase in the benefit-in-kind rate to 30 per cent announced in the budget is seen as being fair.  Equally, the Government consider that the curtailment of tapering relief so as to impose a charge in all cases where a company car is available for private use is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the benefit-in-kind charge does not apply where an employee arranges with his employer that he will not have the use of the car other than for business purposes; therefore, the provision of cars exclusively for business purposes is not being taxed. Alternatively, no charge will arise where an employee uses his own car for work and, subject to Revenue approval, is recouped the cost involved by his employer.</P>
    <P>It is tentatively estimated by the Revenue Commissioners that in any one year about 90,000 individuals in all have private use of business cars.  However, to determine the number of commercial travellers affected by the budget changes would require identification of the cases involved and an individual examination of all the income tax returns of such cases. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that such an examination could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that the changes mean an increase of 50 per cent in respect of benefit-in-kind at the lower end of the mileage scale and an increase of 720 per cent on benefit-in-kind for a person driving <Col N="1406" /> in excess of 30,000 miles?  Does the Minister consider this fair to reps. on the road who use their car as a tool of their trade?  I would urge the Minister to amend the proposal so as to distinguish between persons who have a company car as part of a remuneration package for tax efficiency purposes and people who use their car five days a week as a tool of their trade, because they are being blackguarded by this proposal?  I know it was not the Minister's intention that it would have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy is distinguishing between those who have very small mileage and those who do not really need a car for their work.  In that regard the Deputy has probably seen the <i>Financial Times</i> survey, dated 18 March 1992, which was carried out by the Wyatt company, a highly reputable organisation on management consultancy, on the proportion of companies that provide staff with optional extras.  In relation to cars, this country is at the top of the list of 17 countries and it shows we have to deal with this matter.  I have some sympathy particularly for high mileage drivers in respect of whom the Deputy said there has been an increase of 720 per cent on benefit-in-kind.  I will examine the tapering relief prior to the Finance Bill.  I should like to make the point &mdash; because it is misunderstood in many cases and is put forward in such a way that it would be misunderstood &mdash; that what we are talking about here is the taxable benefit arising from the availability of private use of a car provided by an employer.  The benefit-in-kind charge does not arise where the employee arranges with his employer that he will not have the use of the car other than for business purposes. If somebody in Donegal or Kerry is working from a Dublin base it may not be practical to leave the car in and I accept that point.  But in the case of people working in the city, from whom I have received a number of representations, who are doing very small mileage, they would not have the same argument. Some of those people do approximately 10,000 business miles, 200 miles per <Col N="1407" /> week, which is very small mileage because a great number of people in the city would be doing approximately the same mileage.  I will examine the case of the high mileage people.  The argument is whether the relief should be tapered. Independent assessors have calculated the value of a company car at 40 per cent and that figure has been borne out time and again in several reports carried out by management consultancy firms.  From all the representations and deputations I have received, including those from the sales and marketing trade union and other companies, it is not so much the 30 per cent they are arguing about but rather the tapering relief.  I will examine this matter prior to the Finance Bill.</P>

It arose in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>; and if there were good reasons for it the Government would discuss it with the representatives of the workers or directly with the workers involved where it would be in the best interests of the company and in the public interest.  That was the basis for examining privatisation.  Over the years I tended to be on the other side of the argument, but in the Irish Life case the expansion and retention of employment can be argued equally.  The same applies to other State companies where there <Col N="1409" /> may be a valuable asset today but where changes &mdash; not perhaps tomorrow but in the medium and longer term &mdash; could remove that asset and the competitive advantage.  The State does not have capital to invest in companies, therefore joint ventures or other arrangements should be examined.  I should mention that that is in accord with the thinking of the Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9, 11, 33, 44, 50, 78 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The current Structural Fund regulations treat Ireland as one region.  The regulations also provide for applications to be submitted through member state governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While regulations governing the provision <Col N="1414" /> of Structural Fund aid after 1993 have yet to be negotiated at Community level, I do not anticipate any change in Ireland's status under the Structural Funds.  I am not aware of any proposals to provide for direct access by local authorities to Structural Funds on the basis suggested.</P>
    <P>Although Ireland is treated as one region for the purposes of the Structural Funds, the Government have established a consultative process at national and sub-regional levels to ensure the views of interested groups, including the local authorities and social partners, are taken into account in preparing applications for assistance and implementing Structural Fund aided programmes.  When the National Development Plan was prepared, the Government established sub-regional committees to provide an input from local authority and social partner representatives.  This consultative process has been developed further under the Community Support Framework which provides for a monitoring role for the sub-regional review committees. Deputies may be assured that the Government will provide for continued involvement for sub-regional interests in planning for Structural Fund assistance in the post 1993 period.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to ask the Minister two supplementary questions.  Has he been given any indication yet as to what the increase will be in the next tranche of Structural Funds? Second, is he aware that there is widespread concern at the fact that there is no local input into the application for Structural Funds; that while, in theory, there is a consultative mechanism in practice decisions are taken centrally in his Department and that as a result frustration is building up in the regions?  Has <Col N="1415" /> he any proposals to give the regions a real say in deciding which projects should be backed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the first part of the Deputy's question which relates to the Delors II package, there have been no changes to what was proposed by the European Commission in February.  The Council will discuss this package the weekend after Easter.  The indications at this stage are that the Commission would like an agreement to be reached in the middle of the year so that work could proceed in the second half of the year during the United Kingdom Presidency.  It has been proposed that the Structural Funds should be increased by 67 per cent while the Cohesion Fund should be increased by the remaining amount.  Therefore taking the two together, the funds available for the four less developed countries, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, would be doubled. The point should be made, however, that this would not mean that the funds available for each of the member states would be doubled, unlike the 1988 package.  These are linked to the VAT base &mdash; 55 per cent as against a rate of 50 per cent.  While I would like to see these figures strengthened I should say to the House that we cannot ignore the strong comments that have been made by a number of member states which are major financial contributors.</P>
      <P>In response to the second part of the Deputy's question, the sub-regional committee were set up late in the day and they went to unnecessary expense in providing detailed reports which were not prioritised through no fault of their own.  Yesterday, I had a meeting with the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the chairmen of the other sub-regional groups and the central monitoring committee and its secretariat when we discussed the points raised by the Deputy to see if the sub-regional committees can be given a more meaningful role.  They accepted that while the central monitoring committee will continue to monitor developments they will have a say.</P>

It is intended that the Government will soon agree on the new regions.  I would not want the committees to start their task in one area and then have to move to another to complete their work.  That would be unfair to people who, broadly speaking, work voluntarily on these committees. They are to consult on that matter and I undertook to check with my colleagues in Government on the question of a precise date when the changes might be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the assurance of the Minister in relation to the consultative committee.  The Minister must be aware that, specifically in relation to county roads, members of the European Parliament are approached to do something about them; and that members of the European Parliament appear helpless because of the mechanism used nationally and have no clout in relation to regional development as such.  Is the Minister also aware that ports here feel at a disadvantage in contrast to ports in the North?  Will the Minister do something to achieve the true objective of the allocation of these funds which is to assist in regional development?  Surely there is a contradiction in the approach adopted on a national basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reforms sought in 1988 was to move from a project basis to a programme basis.  The proposals come back to monitoring committees that are linked (a) with the committees, (b) with the Government Departments and (c) with State agencies. The projects from the various regions are then put into programmes.  This is the <Col N="1417" /> same system as applies in all member states.  The national authorities agree with the committees a set of operational programmes which define the measures which can be aided.  The project selection is a matter for the implementing agencies. However, the local authorities feel they should have a greater role in that and I replied to Deputy Noonan on that.</P>
      <P>There are other programmes apart from the European Social Fund, like the peripherality programme and the INTERREG programme and the rural development programme.  There is no reason why projects which are at the heart of regions cannot be put forward. They do not have to follow the same strict and rigid criteria.  I have tried to loosen up the involvement of the groups involved in the western development committee, the peripherality, rural and INTERREG committees.</P>

      <P>The primary thrust of the Government's plans for economic development and job creation is set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Programme for Government and the various operational programmes for the administration of EC Structural Funds.  Additionally, the Government are currently actively addressing the question of maximising the employment creation impact of expected economic growth.  I agree that the lessons learned on foot of any notable successes in enterprise development and job creation should be widely disseminated. I am satisfied that the structures which are in place already, notably those involving the IDA and the county development teams, both of which operate in County Monaghan, are adequate to ensure that experience gained in that county in the enterprise mentioned by the Deputy can be transmitted to other areas of the country efficiently and effectively.</P>

      <P>The rules concerning the conduct of civil servants in the course of their official duties are contained in a number of circulars issued by my Department over the years.  The personnel code for the Civil Service includes a special section entitled &ldquo;Conduct&rdquo; which comprises the various circulars which have been issued.  It is the responsibility of individual Ministers to ensure that the staff in their Departments are fully informed of and comply with these instructions.  I understand that it is the usual practice of Departments to draw the relevant circulars to the attention of staff when they enter the Civil Service. In addition, the regulations concerning official secrecy and integrity, conflicts of interest and political activities are included in a staff information booklet published by my Department in October 1990 and issued to all members of staff. I am currently having a comprehensive review carried out with a view to ensuring that the regulations in question are comprehensive and fully up-to-date.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the rules referred to derive from principles laid down after a court case in Britain in 1928 and they are hopelessly anachronistic in terms of coping with modern pressures and modern culture within which civil servants have to work.  Has the Minister any intention of suggesting that there be a written code such as that suggested in the question?  Does the Minister have any idea of the best way for a civil servant to contend with a situation where he believes his Minister is engaged in unethical practices as, for example, was highlighted in the Ponting case in Britain?</P>

      <P>We were discussing this just before Deputy Rabbitte came in. There are all sorts of circulars containing rules, guidelines, etc., mainly restrictive, covering the Civil Service grades.  There are detailed manuscripts dating back 100 years on procedures, if anything laying down far too many rules for civil servants who are criticised when they follow them &mdash; they are not criticised for not following <Col N="1420" /> them because there have been no incidences of that.</P>
      <P>In cases where they have outside interests, or their families have an interest, civil servants must declare those interests.  There are documents in regard to contracts, purchases and sales, dealings with other Government Departments and State agencies.  There is a document from 1979 dealing with official secrets and integrity and that is fairly up-to-date. There is the document of 1929 in regard to purchases and sales and Government Departments.  There are also rules in regard to standing for elections. Some of these have been tidied up in the 1990 staff information booklet.  I am currently examining how we can deal with them all comprehensively.  There is no question of under-regulation.  It is perhaps the other way.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the increasing success of the national lottery, he will consider measures aimed at redressing the balance of inflows towards charitable organisations who have been adversely affected by the national lottery success; and if in particular, he will consider (a) restricting the growth of inflows to the national lottery and (b) funding the deficits being experienced by charities which can be identified as directly attributable to switching of funds to the national lottery.</Quest>

      <P>I fully recognise and admire the very good work done by voluntary and charitable organisations and I acknowledge that fund-raising must be a constant source of concern to them. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the question of fund-raising by charitable organisations whether by way of lotteries or other activities is not in the first instance a matter for my Department. While there have been from time to time allegations that charities have seen their lottery sales decline in recent years, it is my understanding that such lotteries represent only a very small proportion of the total funds raised by voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>As Minister responsible for the national lottery, however, I could not accept any proposal which would restrict the growth and development of the national lottery, given that any such move would have severe consequences for the many important programmes which are funded by the national lottery &mdash; including, indeed, many voluntary and charitable organisations.</P>
      <P>The question of whether funding might be made available to voluntary bodies who could demonstrate that the national lottery had adversely affected their fund-raising is one of a wide range of issues covered by a comprehensive submission from a number of charities which is currently under consideration in my Department. That study is ongoing and I would not be able to express a view on that particular issue pending completion of that study.  I hope to be able to respond to the points made by the charities in their submission soon.</P>

What proposals has the Minister to ensure that applications are dealt with on merit rather than on political considerations?

      <P>A lot of the money collected through the lottery goes back into departmental Estimates and then goes to charitable groups.  The Department of Social Welfare estimated that some £200 million was paid to voluntary bodies from the Exchequer in 1991 and that approximately £20 million of that came directly from the national lottery. The Deputies in their questions suggest that some of the charities who have pools and other fund-raising events feel that they have lost out.  These issues have to be considered.  Developing the lottery and taking profits back into the system to try to assist local communities is the best way forward.  The other question raised by Deputy Lowry has been resolved.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Deputy Barry is trying to suggest.  Every decision is taken on clear criteria and not just on financial grounds.  Every tender sought carries a caveat that the lowest tender need not be accepted.  That is traditional Government and commercial practice.  The decision in all decentralisation cases is taken on the basis of location, design, architectural layout, accessibility and financial considerations. The decentralisation programme has been extremely successful, even though Deputy Barry was a member of a <Col N="1424" /> Government who cancelled the programme. A decision has never been taken on the basis of personalities or politics.</P>

      <P>I will ignore the uncharacteristic cheap gibe of the Minister.  Is the Minister aware that the site in Mahon has been offered free by the Cork Corporation for the purpose of building the CSO and that this almost by definition will be the cheapest tender that is arrived at?  I want an assurance from the Minister that if other pressures are coming on him not to build in Mahon for political reasons, he will not succumb to those pressures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being pressurised to select a particular site.  Part of the decentralisation programme is that where the Government decide to relocate staff, the local authority must provide a site free of charge in each case.  In order to ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money and that equal opportunity is available to all, the State always invites tenders from the private sector.  The only pressures coming are political pressures in Cork where the politicians do not seem to be able to agree where the site should be.  In the final analysis we will take the decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 15, 26, 29, 38, 70 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the self-assessment system for self-employed individuals and companies is being implemented on a phased basis.  The initial phase involved the encouragement, <Col N="1426" /> by publicity and other means, of voluntary compliance by taxpayers. This has been very successful with returns now being filed by some 94 per cent of taxpayers compared with 60 per cent during the pre-self-assessment era.</P>
    <P>Audits have an essential part to play in the policing of the new system.  In line with this objective the audit programme is being progressively expanded.  The programme got under way in 1990 when some 35 inspectors were assigned to self-assessment audit work following special training.  This number increased to 75 at end 1991 and further increases are proposed in 1992.</P>
    <P>Almost 3,500 self assessment audits have been carried out to date.  This represents about 1½ per cent of the self-assessment audit taxpayer base, including companies.  The percentage coverage in each calendar year since the programme got under way was as follows: 1990, 0.56 per cent; and 1991, 0.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The level of audit which is envisaged as the programme builds up will compare favourably to that in other self-assessment jurisdictions.  For instance, the audit rate in the US and Canada is below 1 per cent of the total of individual taxpayer returns.  In addition, there will be extensive screening of taxpayers' returns as a basis for selection for audit.  This screening, which is carried out by trained inspectors of taxes, is pursued to different depths and culminates ultimately in a number of cases being selected for audit. Ultimately it is not the percentage of return audited which will underpin compliance but the perception among taxpayers of the professionalism and effectiveness of the selection of cases for audit where there are indications of tax evasion.</P>
    <P>The self-assessment audits are, of course, only one dimension of the total Revenue compliance programme which includes large numbers of other inspections and visits to traders' premises.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that the Revenue Commissioners and the Government are committed to providing a level of auditing which will underpin <Col N="1427" /> compliance without detracting from the advantages of self-assessment for the vast majority of taxpayers who meet their obligations.  The whole point of self-assessment is to free staff resources from the old unproduction work generated by the old system so as to enable them to focus on tax evasion and avoidance.</P>
    <P>These resources are now becoming available.  In addition, arising from impending changes related to the EC Internal Market, Customs and Excise staff are also becoming available for other work.  As I indicated in my budget speech, it is essential that these staff resources are used to the maximum in the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion and avoidance.</P>
    <P>This is why I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to put together new initiatives in these areas for 1992. Assuming that staff co-operation is forthcoming, the initiatives will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for a further increase in the sources devoted to auditing over and above what was already planned.  The initiatives are under negotiation at present between the Revenue Commissioners and the trade unions and I trust that they will be brought to an early conclusion so that we can intensify the drive against tax evasion and further improve the efficiency of our collection system.  In the recent budget I have provided an additional amount of £750,000 to the Revenue Commissioners to help to implement the new collection and enforcement initiatives.</P>
    <P>Apart from the switch of additional resources to audit work, the Revenue Commissioners also plan to strengthen the audit capacity of specialist districts dealing with particular sectors.  This will enable the Commissioners to build up the information bases and expertise that will make early detection of evasion more effective and will also help in tackling schemes of avoidance.</P>
    <P>For the most part, audits are not initiated at random but rather are targeted on the basis of perceived defects in tax returns or supporting accounts. However, the method of selection is <Col N="1428" /> being expanded in 1992 to include the selection of about 5 per cent on a random basis.  It is recognised that random audits under which every taxpayer has the possibility of being selected for audit are essential because such audits encourage compliance by increasing the perceived possibility of an audit.</P>
    <P>In relation to the results of the audits to date, less than 9 per cent of returns filed in 1990, and which were subject to audit, we accepted without adjustment. This has now risen to in excess of 25 per cent in 1991.  The remaining 75 per cent have yielded an average of approximately £10,000.  Because cases are selected for audit on the basis of some perceived shortcoming in the return, this figure cannot be taken as a reliable indicator of the general level of compliance in the self-employed community at large.</P>
    <P>While good progress has been made to date in implementing self-assessment, the momentum must be maintained.  I would stress that the intensification of the audit programme and the improvement of the collection and enforcement system generally require the active support from all sides within the Revenue Commissioners so as to secure the necessary deployment of staff on the most efficient basis.  Both the Revenue Commissioners and the Government will be keeping progress under close review.</P>

      <P>I gave a longer reply than normal and I thank the House for its patience.  The Revenue Commissioners have been trying over several years to put in place a number of structures which I have outlined.  Regarding resources, I said in my budget speech that the vast majority of the 608 people who will not be required from 1 January next for Customs and Excise work will, if I can get agreement at union level, be brought into the system and most of them into this kind of work.  All of us receive a salary <Col N="1429" /> and pay what is legally required.  Everyone should be in the same position.  Revenue are trying to focus on who should be audited.  I have been told in discussions with accountants and tax practitioners that some of the audits are overrigorous.  The intention of Revenue is not to be overrigorous on the wrong people but rather to screen the cases which will then be rigorously dealt with. It takes some time to achieve that.  It is not perfect in 1992 but they are working on a programme leading to 5 per cent random audits.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I put it to the Minister that he is not in a position to give accurate information because the very information he provides shows that he and the Revenue Commissioners do not know the true position.  Of the sample audited, 75 per cent had evaded to an average of £10,000.  That kind of evasion, even on a screened sample, is so big that the Minister is not in a position to state what the position actually is.  Only when he has a significant random sample will he know the compliance and evasion rates. When he talks about a 5 per cent random sample for audit, is he talking about 5 per cent of those sampled or 5 per cent of taxpayers who submit returns on self-assessment?</P>

      <P>That is the figure projected. At this stage we are on 1.5 per cent of the cases returned, including companies. These are cases that would be screened.  Quite a large proportion would be companies and the remainder would be general cases.  There are about 30,000 calls by Revenue apart from this.  We are talking about the auditing aspect and 1.5 per cent is still too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be correct to say that the amount of tax outstanding in respect of every self-assessed taxpayer can be based on these figures.  The figures are based <Col N="1430" /> on cases where Revenue knew there was non-compliance.  The Deputy is correct that the figures for that group were extremely serious.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter of staff resources. If this House is serious about assisting the Revenue Commissioners to do this work it must give them additional strong powers.  I have watched attempts by Ministers in various Governments to bring in strong powers for the Revenue, but people tend to get cold feet.  I hope I will get support in the Finance Bill for tough measures.  The Revenue require tough powers to deal with tough non-compliers; otherwise we will be sending people out to do an impossible job.  They will be run ragged by people who know the law.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Self-assessment can only work if those who are sending in returns are fearful that if they do not send in proper returns they will be found out and penalised.  People whom the Revenue suspect of non-compliance are being chased in the traditional manner.  The random sample for audit, on the Minister's figures, is 5 per cent of 1.5 per cent, which is 0.075 per cent.  The chance of being audited on a random basis is so small that it must be very tempting for people to put in any figure that comes into their heads.  Self-assessment cannot work unless there is a significant random audit sample, but that is not the case at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that we have not reached the stage where there is a satisfactory random sample system but there has been an improvement.  However, the point remains that increased powers are required to deal with defaulters.  In fairness to the Revenue, over 100,000 returns are screened each year and it is from that number that they take the percentage we are quoting.  The most qualified staff is used in the screening process because they are the people who can detect non-compliance.  Our objective is to ensure that a higher proportion of the 100,000 is selected for a full and <Col N="1431" /> rigorous audit.  With increased powers which will be contained in the Finance Bill, in a few years' time the number selected will be substantially increased, as is the wishes of Revenue.  I will return to that matter again on the Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday I introduced the subject of the scale of charges as applied by the legal profession. Lest there be any doubt about what I will say at a later stage, I would point out that about 95 per cent of the legal profession are decent, hardworking, honest men and women who provide an excellent service for the community.  They are deeply conscious of the need to protect the rights of their profession and of the community and to maintain the highest standards so as to protect the good name of the profession.</P>
      <P>This House is well served by people from the legal profession of whom the profession, the country and the Legislature can be proud.  I would not wish these people to take my remarks as being indicative of my opinions of them.  The legal profession is the only group in this House capable of transcending all boundaries, political or otherwise.  Since I was elected to this House ten or 11 years ago various professions have risen in support of each other when one or other was under attack, but that position has changed and only the legal profession remain stalwart in responding whenever one of their members is under attack in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the scale of charges, there is one interesting provision in the Bill which prohibits the society from deterring members of the profession from advertising their charges.  I am spokesman on the insurance industry for the Fine Gael Party and one thing that annoys me is that some members of the legal profession take it upon themselves to advertise as a no foal no fee basis. They advertise their availability to pursue claims for people who trip, slip, fall or are injured when something falls on them <Col N="1497" /> on the basis that there will be no charge unless they are successful in their claim. People can discuss matters confidentially in the clear knowledge that they will not have to pay unless they win the case.  That is a recipe for disaster because, ultimately, each member of the profession will compete on that basis in order to ensure they get a fair share of the business. However, at the end of the day the people who pay are the members of the public, those who pay insurance.</P>
    <P>The advertising of charges can be of benefit in that it clearly indicates to the public how much the legal firm will charge in the event of their services being used.  It alerts the public to their liabilities and eliminates the possibility of a hidden agenda, for example, charges for items such as telephone calls, letter writing and so on, tasks which are carried out by many of us on a regular basis without charging.  On the other hand, the advertising of charges could advertise the availability of the legal firm for particular cases.  By advertising that services are available at a cost they are merely suggesting that the public should know how much they will be charged before they decide to take a claim.  The point I am making is that there is a positive and a negative side to the question of charges &mdash; there are the hidden charges and the publicised charges.</P>
    <P>The issue of charges ties in with that of advertising.  Advertising, from the point of view of insurance, which I have already mentioned, has to my mind done irreparable damage and has contributed in a serious way to the vast increase in the number of insurance claims experienced through the years.  If the increase in the number of claims is allowed to continue at the present rate the problem will become much more serious.  The other side of that argument is the need to protect the consumer from the person who, at the end of an action, presents an account of size of which the client has not being alerted to.  A client often goes through a course of consultations only to find at the end of those consultations that the figure he or she is expected to pay up is well in excess of what was expected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> The prohibition on solicitors deducting their costs as a percentage of damages recovered without the prior agreement of their clients is an entirely acceptable provision and one with which I agree.</P>
    <P>Charging costs as a percentage of damages awarded is another issue in which there are two sides to the argument.  I well understand that a solicitor or a barrister dealing with a case that involves a sum of several hundreds of thousands of pounds, perhaps more, could feel that he or she had to command a charge in keeping with the responsibility placed upon him or her because of the amount involved.  On the other hand, it should not naturally follow that the value of a transaction should relate directly to the granting of an amount of money in line with the value of damages awarded.  This aspect is covered in a different section of the Bill.  A solicitor could have a very simple transaction that involved hundreds of thousands, or even millions of pounds or the same solicitor could have a transaction that required the expenditure of considerable time and energy but involved a very small amount of money.</P>
    <P>I should point out that I know of solicitors who have carried out time-consuming work for no charge at all.  In fairness to the profession, I should mention that in some instances a solicitor, recognising an individual's inability to meet high costs, has taken it upon himself or herself to write off the charge but still carry out the legal responsibility. However, there is also the minority, who do, on a regular basis, impose high costs on those whom they know cannot afford them.  It seems that they first consider the value of a transaction and then, by the use of some kind of a scale that I understand exists, determine the costs to apply to a client.  For some unknown reason, those costs have a peculiar habit of arriving at the sum total of the benefit awarded to the client.  That is a very curious coincidence, but it has happened on several occasions.  I am sure that the fine, upright members of the profession who sit in this House, including the Minister of State opposite, will recognise the truth in what I am saying.  I certainly do not intend my <Col N="1499" /> comments as any criticism of the Minister or any other Members of the House.</P>
    <P>One of the most spectacular cases I have dealt with, and I am sure that other Deputies could tell a similar story, concerned the contesting of a will.  If a close relative of a deceased person contests a will then it should be possible to advise the client at an early stage of his or her chances of success and in the case of a thirty-second or a thirty-third cousin contesting a will it should not be too difficult for a solicitor to work out that person's entitlement before going through a lengthy, expensive process. However, that is not what happens.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I dealt with a case in which the total value of the estate was about £35,000 or £40,000 and in which the transfer or property by will to a close relative &mdash; a niece or nephew &mdash; was required.  The will was contested by a much more distant relative.  It took two years to resolve the case as in the very difficult situation arising in such instances it is important to make sure that everything is done properly and to the letter of the law.  By an amazing coincidence, when the case was resolved and the account was furnished, it transpired that there was no benefit to anyone except the fortunate members of the legal profession who dealt with the case.  The person for whom the property was intended received no benefit at all.  When the bill of costs to the client was calculated it arrived at the self-same figure representing the total value of the estate.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how that could have happened.  I could have understood if the final bill of costs resulted in a charge of £20 or £30 more to the client &mdash; even £100, £200 or £300 more &mdash; and I could well have understood if the end result was £5,000, £10,000 or £15,000 less, but I do not understand the way in which the bill of costs arrived at the same amount as the total value of the estate.  The result was very peculiar.  I am quite sure that it took a very long for those involved to sit down and work out the costs in such a way that in the end they did not have to write out a cheque to anyone.  In actual <Col N="1500" /> fact, the individual who made the will, if properly advised, could easily have phoned a solicitor in the first instance and said that he or she would leave all of the property to the solicitor because the solicitor would get it anyway.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the case to which I refer did not even go to court, it went only to the steps of the High Court. I hate to think what the cost would have been had it actually gone to court.  Of course, in reaching the steps of the High Court, barristers became involved and many expenses were incurred, such as those paid for witnesses who had to stay in the best hotels when they would not ordinarily have gone to them.  It is very strange that it took the entire estate to clean up the matter.  That was neat.  I mean no disrespect to anyone, and I am quite sure Members in the House realise that I do not, but the fact remains that that kind of thing does happen.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the area of negligence, which is covered fairly adequately in the Bill.  A classic example of negligence relates to the registration of property at the Land Registry.  It is not uncommon to hear of cases in which, perhaps ten years after property changed hands, it is discovered that title had not been registered with the Land Registry, despite the fact that a fee was charged for that.  That is another peculiarity.</P>
    <P>One instance with which I am particularly familiar concerned an unfortunate individual &mdash; who could ill-afford it &mdash; who had to draw £10,000 from a lending institution to increase a mortgage in order to ensure continued occupancy in a house.  That happened simply because at the time the property was obtained the solicitor involved was negligent and did not conclude the registration of title.  The negligence was discovered only when the person wanted to sell the property and ran into difficulties because in actual fact the title was not in the correct name.  The negligence provision in the Bill provides, I hope sufficiently, for such acts of negligence. If I may, I shall revert at a later stage to the subject with which I have just been dealing.</P>
    <P>Another provision in this Bill which <Col N="1501" /> worries me is to allow banks to undertake conveyancing, a proposal about which I would be extremely worried.  Some of my best friends are bank managers, and I would hope that we would remain on that footing for as long as possible.  I would be very worried that a lending institution, an arm of which would take on the role of conveyancing, would have a vested interest in determining, first, the manner in which they might go about their task and, second, that there would be a serious conflict of interest because they were employed by a financial institution. I do not think that proposal should ever have been advanced.  In 95 per cent of cases, the legal arms of such institutions, undertake their task efficiently and honestly.  But in the event of a dispute arising between an account holder and the bank, human nature being what it is, it would be my fear that the member of the general public whose conveyancing was being handled by a lending institution would find himself or herself at a slight, perhaps more than slight, disadvantage. Such conflict might well run counter to the provisions in this Bill that costs be indicated to a client beforehand.</P>
    <P>It is well known that some lending institutions operate through the credit bureau system, which is a peculiar one.  Take the case of those whose conveyancing is being done by a bank who wish to move their account to another lending institution, on the basis that they do not like their bank manager or for some such reason.  Without naming any institution, it has not been unknown for at least one such lending institution to first check with the credit bureau to ascertain where that individual intends to shift their account. Therefore, when a check is carried out into the individual's creditworthiness, the agency to whom they intend to apply will be cleared, but no others; despite the fact that they are being given a clean bill of health by the financial institution.  That is something that has occurred on several occasions.  I am sure Members present are well aware of that.  At best it is devious; at worst it is much more.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that an individual who enters into an agreement or arrangement, <Col N="1502" /> legal or otherwise, with any large institution is entitled to fair play no matter how large the institution or how small or insignificant the group represented by the individual.  I contend that the practice of any institution to first check to ascertain where an individual will apply for funds to relieve his or her responsibilities to that institution amounts to a type of blackmail because they can blacken their name with all others.  This practice will be of even greater significance if the banks are to undertake conveyancing, when they may well ask the relevant individual: where do you intend applying for this loan to carry this account in future?  If the individual is foolish enough to inform them, all they have to do is clear that particular agency with the credit bureau.  This means that if, say, agency A is approached by a client for a loan, on checking with the credit bureau they will be told that this is a good client. However, if the lending agency in control does not know to whom the application for the loan is being lodged, they will have to clear all inquiries through the bureau.  Some people in the House may think I am exaggerating or that that does not happen.  I can assure them it does happen; I have seen it happen.  I am sure that other Members here must know it happens also.  That is sharp practice on the part of the institution concerned; in this instance, it could be the lending institution. It could become even sharper practice if under the provisions outlined in the Bill lending institutions had the right to carry out conveyancing, when a conflict of interest would immediately arise.</P>
    <P>All the people with whom I have discussed the provisions of this Bill have without exception raised serious questions about the possibility of conveyancing being handed over to these institutions, in addition to the fact that they have been known to go on strike, thus limiting their availability to the public.  For example, in the case of such a strike it would be impossible for the public to gain access to their solicitor or his services through the cash dispensing <Col N="1503" /> system.  I should like the Minister to take that point on board.</P>
    <P>Later I propose to make a passing reference to the need for criminal law reform, which legislation should be introduced and considered in this House in conjunction with the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>I might deal now with the matter of criticism.  All of us in this House are subjected to criticism from time to time for one reason or another.  In fact, any time is open season for us to be criticised. Members of the Judiciary and of the legal profession have not been slow to level criticism at us when they see fit.  From time to time they make political statements outside this House which would appear to me to be in serious conflict with the positions they hold.  They tend to resent very much any reference by any Member of this House to the manner in which they conduct their business.  I refer to that in the context of this Bill and of the fact that most of the people about whom I speak have been, or are, members of the legal profession who have moved up through the ranks, and more power to them.  However, I cannot understand why they are so sensitive to any criticism of their charges.  After all, if a person in any private enterprise anywhere overcharges there is nothing whatever unusual about having that brought to the attention of the public and reference made to the fact that they have overcharged.  Yet there appears to be great sensitivity on the part of some members of the legal profession outside this House when questions are raised about their charges, when it is even suggested they have overcharged.  They appear to take it as a personal affront and feel they should do something about such critical comment.</P>
    <P>In recent times the Law Reform Commission advocated revision of the libel laws, it being felt that politicians appear to be becoming overly sensitive to criticism and so on.  I have to admit that quite an amount of criticism is levelled at politicians.  The theory is that there is need to effect some change in that area because libel was being too loosely interpreted <Col N="1504" /> and so on.  But in the case of any criticism of or reference to any member of the legal profession on the part of the media generally, in this House or elsewhere, they respond unanimously and with great alacrity, they feeling the very bastions they represent are being challenged.  That is a peculiar attitude. For example, it is not at all unusual for them to suggest that the Legislature should have done this or that two, three or five years ago or that the legislators should have taken action.  Yet whenever we legislators have taken action they adopt peculiar attitudes when interpreting the legislation placed before them.  There appears to be on the part of the legal profession a great lack of continuity or consistency of interpretation of legislation placed before them.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual for two members of the same profession to interpret legislation in two totally different ways, with the result that we are all confused.  It is not unusual for members of a profession when questioned in this House &mdash; we have a right to question anyone we wish &mdash; to become incensed and suggest that we have over-stepped our authority and should be brought to task for our misdeeds. That is a dangerous attitude which suggests intimidation.  I do not agree with this attitude.  Members of this Legislature, whether or not they are members of the legal profession, should not be intimidated by anybody outside this House.  We have been elected by the people to speak on their behalf.  Regardless of our political affiliations, any suggestion that we should remain silent is a direct attack on democracy which we cannot tolerate or accept.</P>
    <P>Members of the profession should not become over-sensitive about the references made here by Deputies from time to time to charges.  If a charge is valid they should be able to defend it.  They should not get so sensitive about the issue of charges as to suggest that we are in some way undermining their integrity. They should be prepared to face up to this issue.  If the charges are excessive so be it, but if they are not excessive they <Col N="1505" /> should be able to show proof of this. They should set out on paper how they calculate cost and costs in particular areas.</P>
    <P>There is a growing belief that inquiries and investigations are sometimes set up not to produce results which are of benefit to the people but to enhance a person's bank account.  That is not the purpose of inquiries.  Inquiries are set up to ensure that a matter is fully investigated with the view to ensuring that steps can be taken in the future to prevent a recurrence of it, or perhaps recommend that redress should be made by one of the parties involved.  Once an inquiry or investigation is set up it should be allowed to run its full course.  We have every right to ask questions about how long it will take, the manner in which it is being carried out and the costs involved.  Many recent examples spring to mind.</P>
    <P>State institutions, for example, this House, the courts, etc., are subject to attack and criticism.  We do our best to respond as far as possible to valid and justified criticism.  It is important that we do this.  Nobody is above criticism.  We are often criticised in the course of our daily work.  I would be slightly worried about people who are sensitive to criticism and I would be very worried about people who are so sensitive to criticism that they have to react to it.  As I said, the Judiciary often become involved in areas for which they are not directly responsible.  I presume we all do this at times.</P>
    <P>We need to recognise that this House is the senior legislative body.  While we may not always succeed in what we are trying to do, we certainly do our best. The 166 Members of this House make contributions on various Bills from time to time.  Many of us are not qualified in particular areas.  I am certainly not a qualified member of the legal profession. The contributions made by Members give an indication of what we think about a particular Bill and how it will affect the public for whom it is introduced.  It is not acceptable for members from outside professions to take us to task for our lack of foresight when dealing with legislation. <Col N="1506" /> We may have foreseen issues which could arise when the legislation was introduced but it is the interpretation of the legislation at a later date by bodies outside this House which gives it the force or weight it ultimately carries.  We will learn more about this over the next weeks or months in other areas.  I will say no more about this issue at this stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the charging of costs as a percentage of the damages recovered. I am worried about this practice. As I said, I can well understand why a member of the legal profession handling a case in which serious injury has been caused to a person will obviously feel a greater responsibility if a huge claim is made.  However, this does not mean that a member of the legal profession should automatically bear ten times the responsibility for a claim for £1,000 as he would for a claim for £100.  This should not be the case.  In fact, it should be the other way round as the administration involved in both claims is roughly the same.  Obviously if a solicitor loses a case the client will feel he has done a very bad job but if he wins the case it will be like the politician who wins &mdash; he is a fellow well met at that stage.  I am glad that we will at least be able to deal with this issue under the Bill.</P>
    <P>While regard should be had to the responsibility imposed on a solicitor handling a case, regard should also be had to the liability a bill will place on a client.  As I said, the entire estate or claim of a client should not be eaten up in legal costs.  This should not be allowed to happen.  Unfortunately, this has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to conveyancing but I do not think it is any harm to refer again to this issue.  In the past we have dealt with cases where conveyancing has taken a long time.  I know that some delays have been caused by the difficulties in the Land Registry but other delays seem to stem from a lack of response by the solicitor handling the case.  On occasion, public representatives have to get involved to try to sort out the matter.  This should not have to happen.  Public representatives should not have to become involved in <Col N="1507" /> cases which other people are being paid to sort out.  We do not get money for doing this, we do it in the course of the many social services we provide.  We should not have to become involved in doing the job of someone else who is being paid a hefty fee for carrying out a function or service on behalf of a client. I am sure it poses a dilemma for members of the legal profession who are also public representatives because they must regularly be called upon, as a public representative, to sort out a problem caused by a member of the profession who has failed to do his or her job although he or she was paid to do so.  A member of the profession who is a public representative will be asked to do the same job for nothing.  It is a peculiar circumstance but it happens quite regularly and I am sure the Minister is familiar with the practice. I often wonder how a solicitor must feel faced with that situation on a Saturday morning in a busy clinic with 30 or 40 people sitting in a queue.  They have to make up their mind what to do, they might as well resolve the problem themselves and do it for nothing, as many of them do.</P>
    <P>As I said, a large number of members of the legal profession do a great deal of that kind of work and I pay tribute to them for doing so.  I am trying to get at the minority, the 5 per cent who, as in all professions, do great damage to themselves, the profession and the country generally.  I am not against the legal profession, many relatives of mine are members of it and I have not had any rows with them about it.  However, the reason I am worried is that members of any profession whose job it is, for a fee, to advise a client in a particular fashion, take upon themselves a great deal of responsibility.  Two things are important; the advice they give must be good and consistent and the solicitor must be able to stand over it in ten or 15 years' time. They are being paid a fee to advise a person and it is very different from asking politicians their opinions on the weather or something else and getting different answers.  If the public do not like the <Col N="1508" /> answers politicians give they can show their displeasure at the next election. However, they might not be in a position to deal with a member of a profession to whom they go seeking advice which turns out to be wrong.  It comes back to relating the scale of charges to the service and I fully accept the pivotal nature of the service.</P>
    <P>In some cases things do not always work out as one would have liked.  For example, two people may go to different solicitors looking for advice.  A typical matter would be in relation to a contract to purchase or sell a house or other property. Two solicitors, one for the buyer and the other for the vendor, will say that it is a straightforward case and that they will do their best to ensure that everything is brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the shortest time possible with the least expense and inconvenience.  On the other hand, one of them might decide to be clever, will look at the contract very carefully and wonder how he can penalise the unfortunate purchaser, to make more money.</P>
    <P>I came across a case not so long ago where something like that happened.  A contract was drawn up but, unfortunately for the buyer, it did not stipulate, &ldquo;subject to loan approval&rdquo;.  The property being purchased was substandard which is not a simple case to deal with if loan approval is involved because, generally speaking, local authorities, banks and other lending agencies are not too keen to lend if the property is not fully serviced and in good condition, particularly if it is a dwelling house.  That type of case usually involves a minimum of two months, planning permission can take some time and the whole matter could take six months.  I assume that solicitors involved in such transactions would know that the situation is difficult and detailed and would require consideration before a decision is given.  In this case the buyer's solicitor, as I said, forgot to stipulate that the purchase was subject to loan approval.</P>
    <P>After a reasonably short time, given the nature of the case, the vendor's solicitor wrote to the buyer's solicitor stating <Col N="1509" /> that they wished to withdraw from the contract.  The buyer's solicitor was very anxious that this would not happen because of the tedious nature of the business, and so on and he remonstrated with his counterpart.  Matters rested for some time and then the vendor's solicitor wrote to the effect that they were withdrawing from the contract.  As a result the deposit was forfeited, which is a very serious matter.  In legal terms it may be normal but, while a deposit of £100,000 might be insignificant to a millionaire, a deposit of £1,000 could be a great deal of money to a couple who are not well off.  In the case about which I am speaking, it was a sum of £2,000 from a couple who badly needed the money.  They were living in very bad conditions and were making an attempt to house themselves, at their own expense.  They were buying their own house and they honestly thought they were doing everything right.  I would have no objection to them forfeiting their deposit if I thought the vendor would lose as a result of the contract not being fulfilled.  However, that was not the case because there was no difficulty in relation to the buyer, who was quite prepared to pursue the matter until he achieved loan approval.</P>
    <P>Peculiarly, the property was sold to somebody else at a price corresponding to the exact amount of the deposit.  It was a strange coincidence.  Surely the solicitor acting for the vendor could have talked to his or her client and said that although they were legally entitled to withdraw from the contract because of the inordinate amount of time it had taken, and that in law they had right on their side, morally what they were doing was wrong?  The solicitor acting for the vendor in that case should have had no compunction about telling the clients that what they were doing would badly effect the people who could ill afford to lose money.  It was a smart alec trick that could have been pulled on two financial institutions or two well-heeled organisations that could afford to lose a deposit, but it should not have been done to a couple who had to scrape their last few bob together for a deposit to buy a <Col N="1510" /> house and who had to live in unbelievable circumstances in order to save money. To pull a stroke like that, and that is what I call it, lets down the legal profession.  I have the name and address of that solicitor before me but I will refrain from naming him because the rules of this House forbid me to name him.  He lives in Store Street, Dublin.  He is quite entitled to criticise me if he so wishes but likewise I am quite entitled in this forum to criticise the antics he pursued in this case.</P>
    <P>It was never intended that people should be advised in that fashion.  Neither side should have been advised in that fashion.  It would have been a simple matter to negotiate with the buyer's solicitor and for both solicitors to accept they should have withdrawn from the case and handed the money back.  That did not happen.  It became a contest between the solicitors as to who would win and who was right in law.  In that uneven contest &mdash; as far as the client was concerned &mdash; the unfortunate purchaser who had paid a deposit of £2,000 lost. This has happened on countless occasions in the past and it is likely to happen in the future.</P>
    <P>I pursued the matter but I was totally frustrated in all my attempts to resolve the matter.  Indeed, I pleaded with the vendors to instruct their solicitor&mdash; I presume they did, because they were decent and honourable people &mdash; to change his mind but there was no response.  Because the vendors were so advised by their solicitor, the young couple who wished to purchase the house lost their deposit.  The solicitor acting on behalf of the vendor proved a point but it was a pyrrhic victory.  He may have won legally, and I know that morals do not enter into it in that arena, but nonetheless if he has a conscience at all he may remember these victims in the future. Indeed, he may well be on the receiving end; perhaps he was on the receiving end in the past and that is why he did it.</P>
    <P>To do such a thing to a couple is tantamount to sticking your hand into their pockets and walking away with their money.  If this was done to a large institution, <Col N="1511" /> a bank or a building society, it would be wrong.  If this happened in a deal between two corporations it would be legally and morally wrong but because of the circumstances of this case it was doubly wrong.  Surely, it is a question of conscience.  Mind you, I doubt if he has a conscience.</P>
    <P>I know that other Members have had experiences of the legal profession.  I know that this case is the exception rather than the rule and that we do not expect to have a repetition of it every day, and I know we will not.  However, there should be some provision in the Bill to nail down once and for all the way contacts are entered into and the manner in which you can extricate yourself from one.  We need to have regard to the rights of the individual for whom the solicitor is acting rather than ensuring that a solicitor for either party proves a legal point.</P>
    <P>Everybody can be put at a disadvantage at some stage.  It would have been useful to refer to the manner in which contracts are drawn up.  Generally speaking, there is a standard contract and I hope we can ensure that we will not have a repetition of the case I have referred to and that there should be a time limit imposed on fulfilling the contract and that regardless of what happens in that period a refund will be given.  Perhaps there may be some legal charges but I hope the legal costs will not amount to the sum of money involved.  However, this is covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>While the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill is helpful and has some worthwhile innovations, it would have been useful also to have aspects of our criminal law amended. We have all seen cases on television where the victims have brought their circumstances to public notice.  Society is becoming more and more violent; there are various contributory factors, and there is a need to revise the criminal law in line with the Bill before us so that the law will be respected outside this House.</P>
    <P>The public regularly question the consistency of court verdicts.  I can never understand why in almost identical cases of robbery, or robbery with violence, the <Col N="1512" /> defendants can walk away scot-free, or as near as possible to scot-free, without having a penalty in keeping with the crime imposed on them.  I cannot understand that.  In this House, even though we are criticised from time to time, we try to be reasonably consistent; but consistency does not seem to apply in that area.  I noted with some interest a discussion on a recent television programme where views were put forward by various people and the Legislature was blamed repeatedly for inaction.  The legislation which has been put in place has not always been acted upon and certainly has not always been enforced in a consistent fashion.  We in this House cannot be expected to legislate for every conceivable situation that is likely to arise in every single set of circumstances.  We can only do our best.  It will be a matter for those who sit on the benches to interpret the legislation.  If we do not have some changes in the criminal law Bills such as this will be immaterial; it is simply papering over cracks and will have no permanent or lasting effect.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the matter of bail.  It is not unusual for somebody to be caught either in the act of armed robbery or mugging some unfortunate elderly person or young person in a public place in broad daylight and to be taken to court, charged and remanded on bail. After two or three weeks they can be out again and repeat the same performance and again be charged and remanded on bail.  I have a simple view on that.  For anybody who is either involved in an armed robbery or caught carrying arms or offensive weapons there should be no question of bail whatsoever; they should be remanded in custody until such time as the courts had time to hear the case.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of ensuring that the Constitution is observed and that the State protects the rights of the individual. I know that under the Constitution until such time as a person is found guilty they are presumed innocent.  I fully subscribe to that view.  How then does one deal with criminals who abuse the system? They use the system to perpetuate their own profession.  If they have a sawn-off <Col N="1513" /> shotgun, a hatchet or a chainsaw in the boot of their car, if they are about to saw off somebody's head in order to take their money from them, they know when they are caught that they will be charged and remanded on bail.  They know too that they can go back after a week or a fortnight and buy replacement tools of the trade to carry out a similar type act.  I find that peculiar.  It is not unusual in the courts to find somebody who has appeared there again and again on a multiplicity of charges; in fact, such people often receive a sentence while awaiting trial on a subsequent charge or charges. I do not understand why that self-perpetuating system goes on.  There is an absolute necessity for the introduction of another Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the television programme to which I referred earlier regarding the Criminal Justice Bill of the mid eighties.  I was a Member of the House at that time.  Despite what was said on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, a strong lobby of people wrote to every Member of the House repeatedly asking us to water down the Bill and to have regard to the human and civil rights of the accused. We fully appreciate and understand they are entitled to their civil and human rights and so on.  The legislators backed off because they were subjected to a long tirade of representations and accusations beforehand.  We were accused of being regressive and of introducing repressive and oppressive legislation.  A serious campaign was carried out on that occasion by some very responsible citizens, who should have know better, suggesting that this House was attempting to introduce legislation which would put their civil and human rights in jeopardy. That was not true.</P>
    <P>In the meantime innocent people going about their business have had their rights put in jeopardy and have had no redress from any quarter.  Not so long ago a friend of mine, a young, fit, active person, was so badly beaten in the course of his work that he will never work again, though he may well receive some compensation. That person has a wife and family and had been able to provide for <Col N="1514" /> them.  I often wonder where the do-gooders, who are so anxious to help the accused, stand now in relation to that individual?  If they were asked to come into court and testify as to whose rights were being eroded, what would they say? How would they talk to the wife and children of that victim?  Would they say &ldquo;We foresaw in the mid-eighties that people like you could have some redress and that the people who committed the crime might be caught and convicted and given ten years in prison&rdquo;?  Are they going to say they foresaw that?  I do not think so.  What they are most likely to say is that the legislators did not do their job or that somebody else did not do their job, but that they have sympathy for him. Sympathy is not a whole lot of good.</P>

      <P>I am relating this to the fact that alongside the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill there should be an amendment to the criminal law in order to let the public know we are serious about our business in this House.  If we do not do so, what use will the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill be to the person I have just mentioned?  It will have no impact on his way of life or his likelihood of getting some recognition of the fact that his rights were seriously eroded and taken away.  We will not resolve his problem by this Bill on its own so; obviously, we need another Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I request the Minister of State sitting opposite, who knows the law much better than I, who is a recognised expert in that area, and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to give time and energy to examining that entire area.  I am aware that his senior colleague, the Minister for Justice, made some sweeping promises on a television programme recently to the effect that some considerable changes are likely to be made in this whole area.  If so, I hope they will be capable of lasting longer than some of the previous promises made by the same colleague, and I mean no <Col N="1515" /> disrespect to the Minister for Justice.  If we are serious about this business we need to pursue it.  We should recognise the needs now and set out a programme for dealing with them.  We can do nothing.  We can talk about it and we can suggest things that should be done, but it is up to the Minister and his office to introduce the proposed legislation.  It is all very fine saying the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill is an important one and that as a result we will resolve certain difficulties and will try to prevent problems arising in the future but there is no guarantee that we will do this.  Perhaps with a bit of nip and tuck we will be able to make a few minor changes but the important ones&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me permission to raise this important matter and the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce with responsibility for trade and related matters for coming into the House to listen to the case I have to make.</P>
      <P>I have been motivated to raise this matter because it has been drawn to my attention by a number of people in my constituency who are, unfortunately, unemployed and who have been subjected to the overtures of the company in question.  They are called National Safety Association but do not deserve any credit for ascribing that name to themselves. Like the rest of their activities it is probably grossly misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are involved primarily in the sale and distribution of a costly water filter kit of dubious value.  If there was ever a product for which there should be no demand in Ireland it is this item which is <Col N="1516" /> designed to improve the quality of water used in households given that we often boast that we have a clean environment and that the quality of our water is second to none.  I do not know why we should need water filters but these items represent a source of vast wealth and profit for the proprietors of the organisation in question, both in Ireland and in America. I should say, however, that it is their method of operation, rather than the product they sell which causes concern.</P>
    <P>Their normal approach is to invite potential distributors, who are often people who are unemployed and have received redundancy payments, to a meeting which is usually grandiosely described as a &ldquo;business evaluation day&rdquo; in a hotel.  I have in front of me a notice which invites people to the Country Club in Portmarnock, which is on the boundaries of my constituency, for a &ldquo;getting the new person started&rdquo; seminar. However one must pay a fee if they wish to attend.  Among the subjects covered are &ldquo;structuring for profit&rdquo; and &ldquo;trouble shooting&rdquo;, in other words how to deal with the unfortunate and disgruntled customer. The fee for the privilege to attend is £20.</P>
    <P>At these seminars people are bombarded with American style persuasion techniques and given so-called examples to show that extraordinary profits, up to £60,000 per annum, can be made by dealing in these water filters.  The aim is to entice people to spend their money to buy a stock of these items in the expectation that they will be able to sell them to third parties.  For the good reasons I have stated, there is little demand for these filter kits in Ireland with the result that many of those who become involved end up with unsaleable kits on their hands and thousands of pounds of borrowed money lost.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs in a recent comment on the operation of these companies said &ldquo;pyramid companies' profits come not from the final customer but from the people who stock the products &mdash; the intermediary or distributor.&rdquo; The public should be protected from the predatory activities of these companies. <Col N="1517" /> This is a view that has been expressed also by the Director of Consumer Affairs, and I support and endorse it fully.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that it may well be that the National Safety Association are concentrating on countries such as Ireland because they are coming under intense pressure in their home territory. They have been charged in Wisconsin in the United States with using &ldquo;misrepresentation about the performance of their filters&rdquo; and using &ldquo;claims to attract multi-level distributors.&rdquo;  They are reported to be under investigation in a total of 19 US States while in New York they were found to have carried out deceptive business and advertising practices. In Canada, they have been charged with 22 violations of the Canadian competition Act.  It is for these reasons that they are now in Ireland exploiting vulnerable people who become victims of the ploy due to the lack of a jobs policy. It is incumbent on the Government, they can take no direct action, to warn the public to be on their guard and not to be taken in by the gloss and the hype of this company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I deplore the actions of firms of the kind he mentions, who are involved in pyramid selling.  We should take every opportunity to highlight the matter.  As the House is aware, the 1980 Act which is enforced by the Garda Síochána who are carrying out an investigation into the activities of the company concerned, forbids pyramid selling. While it is a matter for the courts to decide what penalty should be handed down, the penalties laid down are a maximum fine of £10,000 or two years imprisonment or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has been highlighted in the newspapers and brought to the attention of the Department and, as I have said, the Garda are carrying out an investigation into it.  I share the Deputy's sense of outrage because gullible people are being duped into, first, attending seminars <Col N="1518" /> where not alone will they be robbed but also have to pay a fee.</P>
    <P>As I know nothing about the article itself I cannot comment on it but it seems there should be no need here for the use of water filters considering the amount of money, both national and European, which has been directed towards infra-structural projects.  Gullible people are being told they can make a lot of money and money is being taken from them to attend on the day.  Then they are left to sell their dubious articles on the market; it goes from person to person and so each layer of the pyramid is created.  This practice has been reported to the Office of Consumer Affairs and they have taken it up in conjunction with our Department. The director is preparing a guide to the public on the issue of pyramid selling and such a guide will, I hope, help those who would otherwise get caught up in pyramid selling to avoid it.</P>
    <P>From the buyer's point of view the adage <i>caveat emptor</i> holds true, but it can be extended to the people who would go to those seminars because they are entering into a transaction that they think will lead to untold wealth.  It is a very mean con trick as well as being illegal. I and my Department will certainly do everything to highlight the dangers of a practice that is not only illegal but which is preying upon the gullibility and the emotions of people who are longing to get into the workplace and feel that this is an avenue to it.  It is particularly despicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition of St. Bridget's National School in Brownstown could be correctly described as Dickensian or close to it.  The school was built in 1915.  The only change since then is the addition of prefabs which are grossly overcrowded, with 36 pupils in accommodation designed for 26.  The prefabs <Col N="1519" /> were bought secondhand and are now 26 years on the site.</P>
      <P>There is no hot water in the school and no water in any classroom.  Ninety-six boys have for their use one urinal and two toilets.  Seventy-nine girls have four toilets between them.  The electrical wiring is outdated and dangerous.  The sewerage in the school is totally inadequate, and there are overflows on to the school yard where the children have to play.  There is blue mould on every wall in the school.  There is a restricted play area and, arising from this, there is on average one accident in the play area per day.  Part of the playground is flooded from the month of October to the month of March.</P>
      <P>Successive Ministers have repeatedly made false promises to management, to deputations and to Deputies of this House arising from the conditions in this school.  If I were allowed by parliamentary rules to do so, I would describe these as bare-faced lies by various Ministers to the people I have mentioned. I know I am not allowed to describe it in that way in the House, so I cannot do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noel Davern, the former Minister, met a deputation during his short tenure as Minister and he described the school as the worst school in the country. He said it would have top priority in all of the Twenty-six Counties for any money that would become available to him during his period in office.  During that time money did become available to him but Brownstown was not included in the allocation.  There was shock, outrage and anger expressed by the parents, the staff and the management arising from this further false promise.</P>
      <P>The people in the area have been too quiet for too long and the staff have now, through the INTO &mdash; and I would like to congratulate the INTO on their very firm action in this regard &mdash; been forced to go on strike at the end of this month against the conditions in the school in which they are forced to work.  The parents are withdrawing their children from the school next Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> The county medical officer has condemned the school as unfit and the fire officer has described it as a fire hazard and has said that it should be closed.  Lo and behold, arising from the actions of parents, the county medical officer and the fire officer, and the threat of strike by the staff, a senior officer of the Department is to visit the school next Tuesday, the same date as the children are being withdrawn from the school.  I want to assure the Minister &mdash; and I am sure the Minister present will tell the Minister for Education &mdash; that the people of Brownstown, the parents of Brownstown and the staff of the school will not be fobbed off again.  We want action now.</P>
    <P>Maybe it is a good omen that the Minister for action is here to reply to my remarks.  Possibly the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works is here because he intends to do something.  We want action this year.  We want bricks and mortar.  We do not want talk of tenders or drawings or stages and all the other rubbish that the people in Brownstown have put up with since they first bought their site in 1980.  We now want action and a political decision that action will be taken.  We will not accept blame being placed on officials for the delay.  This is the year that work must start on building a school in Brownstown. On behalf of the parents, the staff and the pupils I want to say we will not accept any less than that.</P>

      <P>I have listened attentively to all that has been said in relation to the proposed new national school at Brownstown, The Curragh, County Kildare.  The Deputy has outlined the history of the case in great detail, but it would be no harm if I stated the position of the Department of Education on this matter.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that conditions at the existing school are not satisfactory and that the proposed new school has been a long time in the planning.  At present there is staffing of a principal and four assistants and <i>circa</i> 170 pupils.  Accomodation consists of a permanent building containing four classrooms.  There is also a prefabricated classroom.  The Department propose to provide a new building containing four standard classrooms, a classroom the size of a general purpose room which will be a local liability, a library-medical room, a staff room and stores.  We are confident that when this new building is available it will be a source of great pride and joy to all concerned with the project.</P>

We share all their genuine concerns that this project be brought to fruition with the minimum of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that there have been delays in relation to the architectural planning of the project, but I am sure the House will appreciate that in the normal <Col N="1522" /> course of planning for a project of this kind there will inevitably be delays, some of which will be outside the control of any Department, for example, the securing of local authority planning permission.</P>

      <P>The House will also be aware that there is a large number of projects on hand, something in excess of 700.  Each individual school makes a case to the Department that their project is entitled to priority treatment.  It is not possible in these circumstances, but with particular regard to the overall financial constraints, to satisfy all needs simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to the Brownstown project is that the working drawings, that is, the tender documents, are well advanced and it is expected that the case will be ready for tender by the end of this month.  The invitation of tenders will then arise for consideration in the light of the prevailing budgetary situation and having due regard to existing commitments.</P>
      <P>I know the good people of Brownstown will expect an indication from me this evening as to when tenders will actually be invited.  I am unable at this point to be precise in this matter because of the financial situation in relation to the primary schools building programme and the large number of projects on hand.  As the House will be aware, a senior official from the Department of Education explained the situation fully to the representatives of the board of management at a meeting in the Department of Education yesterday, and he undertook to meet with all the school authorities next Tuesday at the school.  The official will give the fullest details to all concerned and answer any questions raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education, the Minister of State, and the Department fully appreciate the conditions at the school and it is their intention to proceed with the project as soon as circumstances permit.  I am aware that there is an urgency about this.  In view of the interest <Col N="1523" /> of the Deputies and their colleagues in the constituency who have made repeated representations about this matter, I will bring the contributions this evening to the attention of my colleague.</P>
    <P>There has been action and dialogue taking place.  Officials have met the representatives of the board of management and a senior official will meet them again next Tuesday.  I ask the Deputies, in the interests of the children, to appeal to the INTO and their representatives to refrain from any action until there has been an opportunity to finalise this matter.</P>

The Government reduced funding by 75 per cent, from £200,000 to £50,000, to groups helping Irish emigrants in the US in 1992. The money will be spent on services nationwide, by 13 agencies in cities like New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco.  There is a stronger case now than ever before for comprehensive services for the new Irish arriving in the US.  The services are in serious jeopardy because of the decreased funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We appreciate that over 66,000 green cards will be issued to Irish people from 1987-1994, but unless strong support services are established in New York where the greater concentration of emigrants are, these people will have a hard time making a positive adjustment.  Emigrants either succeed or fail to relocate successfully in the first month after their arrival.  They must find jobs and compete in a tight jobs market.  They have to compile resumés and upgrade skills to qualify for jobs.  They are some of the basic needs.  Even more serious issues arise which present an ongoing need for services, for example joblessness, homelessness, <Col N="1524" /> psychiatric problems, single parenthood, work related injuries, alcoholism, family breakdown and so on.</P>
    <P>By 1994, 66,000 green cards will have been issued to Irish emigrants.  About 18,000 Donnelly visas were issued between 1987 and 1990 and 48,000 Morrison visas will be issued from now until 1993.  These people will need services. There will be a continuing problem with regard to illegal immigrants in the US who are even more vulnerable.  New York is experiencing its worst unemployment rate for ten years, now running at about 10 per cent.  Work in construction has been seriously affected.</P>
    <P>Young Irish people coming to the US usually do not have any family to guide them through the complex process of adjusting to a new culture.  Support organisations are crucial.  When an Irish person arrives in the US, it takes three to six months for the green card to arrive in the post, it takes three to four weeks for the social security number to be issued and in the meantime the new emigrant has only a stamp on his passport which many employers will not accept as a work authorisation.  In a severe recession, such as the one New York is experiencing, the Irish emigrant may take a month or two to find a job.</P>
    <P>Due to the high cost of living the person may run out of money and may need help from an organisation with regard to housing, jobs and general information. Without the assistance of organisations such as Project Irish Outreach people arriving from Ireland are very vulnerable. Through this organisation new emigrants can avail of specialised services, for example free or low cost immigration attorneys, social workers, entitlement counsellors and so on.  The demand for these services has not diminished in the past four years as more and more legal emigrants arrive in the USA. Legal Irish emigrants have great opportunities in the US.  However, without support services they may miss those opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the <Col N="1525" /> Deputy for his very constructive approach to this issue.  I am aware of the Deputy's deep concern in this area for a number of years.  I will be glad to discuss with the Deputy some of the issues he has raised.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this matter was discussed in the House on 20 February when it was raised by Deputy McGinley.  It was raised again by Deputy McGinley yesterday in two questions for written reply by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The reduction in this allocation reflects the current difficult budgetary situation and the need to find savings wherever possible.  It was a reduction which the Government made most reluctantly.  The figure of £200,000 better reflects the level of concern in Ireland for the welfare of our emigrants in the United States.  I fully acknowledge that a high level of need remains for the services of the various immigrant groups.  I am well aware of the very worthwhile work being done by them in the United States.  I have every confidence that the moneys made available by the Government are being wisely and well spent.</P>
      <P>During the Minister's recent visit to the United States he visited a number of Irish emigrant organisations in New York and saw for himself the excellent work being done by the dedicated staff, most of them volunteers, who operate these centres.  While there, he assessed the situation facing our young emigrants.  While the problems associated with the so-called undocumented Irish is gradually being eased &mdash; though it has by no means disappeared &mdash; a new set of difficulties are now arising as Deputy Deenihan said due to the current recession in the US. The Minister will certainly bear in mind these problems when considering how best we can continue to respond to the needs of our emigrants in the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would certainly be a cause of regret if the reduction in the grant level were to lead to cutbacks in the services provided by these groups.  I can assure the Deputy that the welfare of our emigrants will continue to be a priority for the Government and every effort will be made to <Col N="1526" /> ensure that their welfare concerns will continue to be met.  With this in mind, we have asked the Consulates General in the US to keep in close touch with the situation and report on any significant deterioration that may occur.</P>
    <P>In discussing this issue, we should not overlook the major improvement in the position of many of our emigrants in the US as a result, in particular, of the introduction of the Morrison visas.  Over the three year period 1991-93, a total of 48,000 of these visas will be issued to applicants born in Ireland, and many of the beneficiaries of these visas are at present undocumented residents of the US.  Many of these out-of-status immigrants are now able to adjust their status to that of permanent residents.  Others going to the United States for the first time will have the right of full permanent residency from the date of their arrival. This does not absolve us from doing whatever we can to assist our citizens who may find themselves in difficulties.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware the Minister recently decided to allocate special responsibility in this area to me as Minister of State.  While in London for St. Patrick's Day I availed of the opportunity to meet many of the young people and representatives of the county associations and I had some discussions with them as to how best we can address some of the issues.  I propose to visit the US shortly to assess the current situation so that in the drafting of a long term policy in this area and in deciding long term priorities and commitments we can be fully aware of all the considerations involved.  The question of support for emigrant advice services will be one of the matters to be considered in the context of the discussions I am presently undertaking, in view of the new responsibility that has been given to me.</P>
    <P>I reiterate our intention to take corrective action in regard to this reduction if this is called for at any stage.  I am aware that in many respects it is not solely a question of financial support but of guidance in a whole variety of areas. While financial commitments are essential to the carrying through of the work <Col N="1527" /> of these organisations, there is also a general recognition that what is needed is more contact and communication between us and the emigrant bodies overseas so that we can improve their conditions and maintain a closer dialogue.  I intend to make a contribution towards the development of a long term framework and policy while I have responsibility in this area.</P>

      <P>I have brought up this matter on the Adjournment on a number of occasions during the past five years. The proposed Dirha sewerage scheme would serve about 55 householders, including 12 in the Dirha cottages estate. About 250 people will be involved.</P>
      <P>The Dirha housing scheme was built in 1950 and water supply was provided in 1964, but the estate was never serviced by a sewerage main.  The nearest sewerage link is 750 metres distant from the estate.  Private houses built in the area since 1950 were granted planning permission on condition that individual septic tanks would be provided.  In the past 15 years each householder in the estate had to provide a septic tank.  These have not been 100 per cent successful because the area around Dirha estate is notorious for bad soakage and drainage. The prevalence of septic tanks in such a small area is an obvious health hazard and there was an outbreak of typhoid in the estate in 1969.  The outflow from these tanks flows, totally untreated, along the main roadside drain and eventually into the River Feale.</P>
      <P>The sewerage scheme for Dirha cottages and the surrounding area went to tender in February 1987 but the residents are still waiting for work to commence. The Minister might give an indication as to whether work will begin this year.</P>

      <P>The Dirha East sewerage scheme proposal involves the connection of some 50 <Col N="1528" /> houses along the Ballybunion Road to the Listowel main drainage scheme. These houses are currently served by septic tanks which at times are ineffective. I understand that ground conditions in this area are not ideally suited to this arrangement and that the proposed scheme will eliminate the nuisance caused by septic tanks.</P>
      <P>I have recently allocated some £63.4 million to fund fully approved water and sanitary services schemes throughout the country.  Over £4.48 million of this has been allocated to schemes in Kerry.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the Deputy's concern in relation to this scheme, I am not in a position to say when I can provide the necessary finance.  I will, of course, bear in mind what he has said, but he will appreciate that any decision must be made in the context of the existing level of capital commitments within the overall water and sanitary services programme.</P>

      <P>The local improvements scheme has been a valuable channel for progress in rural Ireland.  It has been of great advantage particularly in getting money for roads in the most neglected and isolated areas.  Because of it many a farmer no longer has to listen to the sound of a car chassis thumping its way back home.  What of the roads still to be done?  This year Sligo County Council have been told that their LIS grant is down from £124,000 to £77,000, a massive cut of 38 per cent.  I am told it is the same sad story in Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and west Cork.  I accept that the Minister is under budgetary pressure, but this is the unkindest cut in that it tends to wipe out from the prospect of relief the roads leading to the most remote places, to the houses which we want to remain inhabited, with smoke coming from the chimney, and the farmers whom we want to remain on the land. Another advantage of the LIS is that it attracts private funds gladly given by the beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from funding, the Minister should also look at the criteria for qualification. There are different interpretations in various counties but the <Col N="1529" /> general requirement appears to be that there must be one or more users of a road for agricultural purposes.  Emigration, families dying out and widespread forestry plantations, have vastly changed the impact of the two or more requirements. It has left a man on his own in no man's land, with no prospect of help.  This is the kind of farmer we should be helping and who should be top of the list in respect of improving access and making life a little easier.  The councils cannot help that kind of man.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to let the LIS die for want of money and also to make provision for the family on the road which is now excluded simply because all the neighbours have gone away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone knows the serious problems which faced the Minister for Finance when he was framing the 1992 budget.  In the light of the many competing claims for relief from different sectors and the limit on the finances available it was inevitable that cutbacks had to occur in some areas.</P>
      <P>As part of this process, the overall allocation for the local improvements scheme was reduced from £4 million to £2.5 million.  Within this overall reduction, we have ensured that each county council have been treated equitably, by applying a general reduction across all councils to reflect the 38 per cent overall reduction, and then by allocating a minimum of £50,000 to each council so that a reasonable programme of works can be carried out in each area. The reduction in the allocation to Sligo Council directly reflects the overall national reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been a long-standing requirement under the LIS that a project must benefit two or more parcels of land owned or occupied by different persons, or serve the public, or serve two or more persons entitled to turbary rights.  It is not proposed to change that requirement. With the reduction in the moneys available for this scheme, it is more important than ever to ensure that the <Col N="1530" /> resources are concentrated on projects which benefit the greatest possible number of people.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On Wednesday last I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment asking if his attention had been drawn to representations being made by representatives of the Adult Literacy Campaign to have photographs of candidates included on ballot papers for elections. I asked him to outline his views on the suggestion and if he would consider an appropriate amendment to the Electoral Bill to take account of this proposal. The reply was that there are no proposals at present for a change in the law in this respect.  I knew that; it is the reason I put down the question.</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter because the Minister's reply was totally inadequate and indicates the kind of arrogance one encounters sometimes from a small minority of civil servants who regard this Parliament as some kind of irritant, interfering with their rightful position of running the country as they see fit.  The civil servant who wrote this reply, the civil servant who authorised it at a senior level and the Minister who put his name to it showed great disrespect to this House in producing such a reply to a serious Dáil question concerning a serious matter.  It should not happen.  It is this aspect to which I wish to draw attention rather than the substantive point.  I should appreciate it, however, if the Minister of State would now deal with the substantive point since the Minister did not deal with it when the question was tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his reply on 1 April that there are no proposals at present for a change in the law to provide for the inclusion of photographs of candidates on ballot papers.  All of us, of course, are well aware of the campaign in this regard. The suggestion is that the inclusion of photographs would help electors with literacy <Col N="1531" /> problems, dyslexia, poor eyesight or mild mental handicap as well as first time voters and foreigners.  The suggestion is an interesting one and it has been carefully considered.  There is, of course, already provision in the electoral law for assisting incapacitated and illiterate electors and those with impaired vision.</P>
      <P>Photographs on ballot papers could assist some electors in identifying the candidate they wish to vote for; but only, of course, if they know what the candidate looked like.  So there would be a built-in bias in favour of well know candidates at the expense of lesser known ones, particularly first time and non-aligned candidates.  There is also the point that many electors vote on the basis of party, with preferences for individual candidates being a secondary consideration. If we accept this, one could argue that we should consider including party logos or emblems on the paper, as is done in many countries.</P>
      <P>Our electoral system is already criticised for putting undue emphasis on personality rather than on policy.  Including photographs would exaggerate this tendency and could have the effect of trivialising elections and turning them into a kind of beauty contest.  We would also have to face the problem of having standard photographs of a large number of candidates taken and reproduced on over two million ballot papers.  While I am sure we could deal with this, it would add to the costs of elections and the pressure on returning officers.  Overall, I do not think that ballot papers should contain photographs of candidates, but the House will have an opportunity to debate the pros and cons when the Electoral Bill, now with the Seanad, comes before it.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health recommended three junior anaesthetic staff for Tralee General Hospital <Col N="1532" /> over two years ago.  There are ten junior anaesthetic staff in Cork Regional Hospital at present.  Because of the level of staffing in this area there is only one anaesthetist on duty at night in Tralee General Hospital.  This individual may have to deal with two emergencies at the one time, which is both difficult and dangerous.  Recently there was the case of an emergency hip operation and an emergency Caesarean section at the same time, and the anaesthetist on duty had to keep both patients asleep simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Patients with serious head injuries are sent to Cork Regional Hospital for treatment. These patients should be accompanied by properly trained personnel. Hence the need for the appointment of a junior anaesthetist to cover this type of duty also.  The Department have permitted specific resources for the provision of an ENT service at Tralee General Hospital.  However, this should not be confused with the appointment of the four junior anaesthetic staff, which is as essential, if not more so, as the appointment of an ENT surgeon.  I appeal to the Minister to give a positive reply to this matter.  I raised it previously but, unfortunately, very little progress has been made in this respect.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter and for giving me an opportunity to respond.  As the Deputy will be aware, the provision, organisation and management of services at Tralee General Hospital are a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.  The identification of priorities in respect of service and personnel needs at Tralee General Hospital, within the context of the overall financial resources available, is thus a matter for the board. It is also a matter for the board to determine the appropriate staff mix in its various hospitals, including junior anaesthetic staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's Health Services Personnel <Col N="1533" /> Census, in respect of 31 December 1991, records a total of 562 staff being employed at Tralee General Hospital. This figure includes a total of four consultant anaesthetists.  The board have indicated that this level of staffing has not diminished.</P>
    <P>The board have indicated to my Department that their top priority for Tralee General Hospital is the development of the ENT service.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that provision for this has been made in the board's revenue allocation for this year.  The board are in discussion with the Department about the detailed arrangements for the improved ENT service.  The junior anaesthetic staffing at the hospital will be reviewed in the context of these developments.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I am always at the bottom of the list as regards questions.  I wish to raise with the Minister for Health the serious situation that exists in Bantry county hospital as regards the condition of the surgical and medical equipment available in that hospital at the moment.  Is the Minister aware that some of this equipment is almost 30 years old?  The hospital matron and surgeons have made renewed requests to the former Ministers for Health and the Department for replacement of the greater part of this equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital is in dire need of two new cardiac monitors for the intensive care unit, two new ventilators, one bronchoscope, one colon-scope and two medicine trolleys.  The surgical department needs two new emergency trolleys, blood pressure monitors, two heparin pumps and an infusomat and dressing trolleys.  It is also essential that oxygen points be installed <Col N="1534" /> over every bed in the medical ward.  The beds in both the medical and surgical wards are almost 30 years old and need immediate replacement.  The bathrooms are antiquated and the facilities are too high and dangerous for patients to use.</P>
    <P>In view of the huge hinterland that Bantry hospital caters for throughout the peninsular areas of south west Cork and south Kerry, it is essential that this hospital be maintained to the highest degree of efficiency possible by the Minister and the Department of Health.  I trust that he will now give my request his immediate favourable attention and ensure that this necessary new equipment will be installed without delay in Bantry county hospital.</P>
    <P>I would emphasis the necessity to maintain the <i>status quo</i> at Bantry county hospital.  It is vital for the inhabitants of south-west Cork and south Kerry that the services now in operation be retained at that hospital.  Parts of my constituency of south-west Cork &mdash; the Beara, Kilcrohane and Mizen peninsulas &mdash; are almost 100 miles from Cork city, while some areas are 120 miles from the city. Therefore, it is vital that the standard of Bantry county hospital be maintained to the highest degree possible.</P>

The board have submitted to my Department a list of requirements for their hospitals, including Bantry General Hospital.  The board have been requested to prioritise their overall equipment requirements for their acute hospitals and when this information is received in the Department it will be considered in the context of the repeating requirements nationally and the resources available for this purpose.  In view of the case made by Deputy <Col N="1535" /> Sheehan, the list received from the Southern Health Board in relation to the various hospitals in the region, particularly Bantry General Hospital, will be very carefully considered.</P>

    <P>As regards the Civil Service, my Department have, over the years, issued a number of circulars outlining rules of conduct for civil servants.  These rules have also been incorporated in a staff information booklet, published in 1990, which was issued to all serving staff and <Col N="1433" /> is given to new entrants on appointment. It is the responsibility of heads of Departments to ensure compliance with the rules of conduct in individual cases.  I should add, however, that I am currently having a review carried out with a view to ensuring that the instructions which have issued over the years are comprehensive and appropriate in current circumstances.</P>

      <P>There were 893,500 visitors to the three national parks at which the Office of Public Works <Col N="1434" /> has provided visitor facilities, to date, in the period 1989-91; 483,000 to Killarney National Park; 293,500 to Glenveagh National Park and 177,000 to Connemara National Park.  The estimated expenditure by these visitors at the national parks was £2,061,000 over the three years.  This figure represents the money spent on admission charges and the purchase of ancillary items at the parks. While the local economies in which the parks are situated have benefited greatly as a result of these visits, I am not in a position to quantify this in monetary terms.  The tourist industry recognises the value and importance of national parks as focal attractions for visitors and they form an important role in Bord Fáilte programmes to attract overseas visitors to Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have set out in tabular form the breakdown of the number of visitors to each site for each of the three years in question together with the estimated expenditure at each site.  This will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer this question in respect of the Votes for which I am responsible.</P>
      <P>The Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, extends the benefits of a range of protective labour legislation to regular part-time workers.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, under the Act regular part-time employees are defined as those who are in the continuous employment of the employer for not less than 13 weeks, are normally expected to work not less than eight hours per week, and who, but for the Act, would be excluded from benefits under the legislation which the Act amends.  Prior to the 1991 Act, an eligibility threshold of 18 hours work per week applied to most of the legislation which was amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of regular part-time workers working between eight and 18 hours per week in that part of the State sector under my aegis is minimal.  Consequently the compliance costs arising under the 1991 Act are miniscule.  The <Col N="1436" /> Deputy can rest assured, however, that any compliance costs arising will be fully met from the provisions made in my group of estimates.</P>

    <P>The extent of the financial benefits which Ireland can expect will depend on the outcome of the negotiations on the package.  The increases proposed by the <Col N="1437" /> Commission are substantial, of course, and of major significance to Ireland. Under the Commission proposals the agricultural guideline would continue, but increased to take account of Common Agricultural Policy reform measures.  In the area of the Structural Funds, the Commission has proposed that there should be an increase of two-thirds in resources made available for Objective 1 regions and that taking account of the new Cohesion Fund, there could be a doubling of the overall resources for the four countries covered by the new fund i.e. Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal. Furthermore, on the revenue side of the EC budget the Commission has proposed a number of changes designed to make the system more equitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">

      <P>One of the criteria which will have to be respected before a member state may progress to the third stage of economic and monetary union is that of a sustainable government financial position. A member state shall be regarded as having a sustainable financial position <Col N="1438" /> unless there is a Council decision to the effect that it is running an excessive general government deficit.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the Council to decide in any particular case whether or not an excessive deficit exists.  The Commission will monitor the budgetary and debt position in each member state and may initiate the excessive deficit procedure if a member state does not fulfil either of the following criteria: that the planned or actual government deficit exceeds a ratio of 3% of GDP, unless the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to 3% or, alternatively, if the excess over 3% is only exceptional and temporary and that the stock of government debt exceeds 60% of GDP and is neither sufficiently diminishing nor approaching this figure at a satisfactory pace.</P>
      <P>It can be seen that the Government will not necessarily have to budget for a surplus to meet these criteria.  Indeed, as I have already indicated to this House, Ireland is now ready for economic and monetary union.  At a meeting on 10 February last which considered Ireland's economic convergence programme, the ECOFIN Council &ldquo;welcomed the fact that Ireland at present complied with the objective criteria for the move to the third stage of European Monetary Union&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 94 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no evidence that drug consignments, as reported in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on Thursday, 6 February 1992, were smuggled ashore along the Cork/Kerry coastline this year.  The Department of Justice have also confirmed that the Garda authorities do not have any information or evidence of such consignments.  I am further informed that <Col N="1441" /> statements in the aforementioned article attributed to senior Customs and Garda officers did not come from approved official sources.</P>
    <P>A large consignment of cannabis was seized by Customs officers at Court-macsherry in July 1991.  Though rumours circulating at the time alleged that other similar consignments had evaded detection, no evidence or information has come to light to substantiate the allegation.</P>
    <P>The Customs authorities are fully alert to the dangers of illicit trafficking in drugs and, in this regard, have assigned staff who have specific responsibilities in relation to combating drug smuggling. These staff consist of a central drugs unit attached to the Customs and Excise investigation branch, drugs intelligence units and staff trained to work with drug detection dogs.  In addition, drugs liaison officers are located throughout the country to monitor drug trafficking and to exchange intelligence with the central drugs unit.  Apart from the staff who have specific responsibilities in relation to combating drugs smuggling, other Customs staff are also concerned with detecting illicit drugs trafficking as part of their normal duties.</P>
    <P>The role of Customs authorities in the detection of illegal trafficking in drugs in the context of the Single Market after 1992 is under active consideration at both national and Community levels with a view to enhancing the present level of mutual assistance arrangements between EC Customs services and other enforcement agencies.</P>

      <P>European Economy (Supplement A, No 11/12 1991) estimates that nominal per head compensation of employees rose 0.2 percentage points per annum more rapidly in Ireland than in the EC as a whole over the period 1989 to 1991 inclusive. Inflation as measured by the price deflator of private consumption, the measure used by the Commission, was 1.8 percentage points per annum higher in the EC than in Ireland over the same period.  Because of this better inflation performance real compensation per employee here rose 2 percentage points per annum faster than in the EC as a whole in the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International cost competitiveness, in my view, is a crucial determinant of employment prospects.  On the more normal measure of competitiveness &mdash; developments in hourly earnings in manufacturing industry expressed in a common currency &mdash; latest OECD data <Col N="1444" /> indicate that increases in Ireland over the period were almost one percentage point below the average for the EC as a whole. It is vital to our long term employment prospects that we maintain, and improve upon, these competitiveness gains which assisted the employment gains of recent years.  The Commission estimates, however, underline the importance of moderation of incomes growth on an economy-wide basis.</P>

      <P>The problem with the precast panels in Agriculture House was discovered in May 1989.  Following a more detailed inspection the timber hoarding was erected in August 1989 at a cost of approximately £30,000 as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of the staff and the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interim survey having been undertaken by EOLAS, a firm of consultant engineers with specialist expertise was appointed in May 1990 to identify the cause of the problem and to compile a programme of remedial works.  A preliminary report received from the consultants in March 1991 indicated that the problem was due to a number of factors <Col N="1445" /> which relate to the particular design of Agriculture House and to the techniques employed in its construction.  Following the completion of a trial programme of work which was undertaken to determine the best method of dealing with the problem the consultants produced their final report in December 1991.  The consultants have recommended structural repairs and remodelling of all damaged panels to match their original profile.</P>
    <P>Tenders will be invited shortly, at which stage the definitive cost will be determined.  It is expected that the work will commence later this summer and take 12 months to complete.  Provision has been made in the Vote for the Office of Public Works, 1992, for expenditure likely to arise on works during the current year.</P>

      <P>The comprehensive employment statistics which are currently compiled relate to total numbers at work at a reference date, rather than to total numbers of new jobs created, or to total numbers of new jobs created in the private sector, over particular periods.  Comprehensive figures of total jobs lost, or of total jobs lost in the private sector, are not compiled. The series on `notified redundancies' compiled by the Department of Labour <Col N="1447" /> is not a full measure of jobs lost: for example, it relates to proposed rather than actual redundancies, and covers only those prospective job-losses where there may be entitlement to statutory redundancy payments.  In consequence, it is not possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, in the period to which the Deputy refers, the private sector made a very substantial contribution to net job creation.  The annual Labour Force Surveys point to an increase in the total number of jobs in the non-agricultural private sector approaching 60,000 in the three years to mid-April 1991.</P>
      <P>With unemployment now over 20% of the labour force, even this pace of private sector job creation falls far short of need. I am heartened, however, by the performance of the private sector since mid-April last despite economic weakness abroad, as indicated by the partial information available since then.  I am confident that, as the international economy recovers, the employment response of the private sector will be strong and sustained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The two characteristics of the Irish economy which have drawn most attention in recent years have been the achievement of the second highest rate of growth in real GNP and the second highest rate of growth in employment <Col N="1455" /> in the OECD area.  From 1987 to 1990, growth in real GNP in Ireland averaged about 5 per cent per year.  Last year, the economy continued to expand despite the fact that recessions in two of our main trading partners, the UK and the USA saw their GNP fall by 0.5 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.  Thanks to competitiveness gains in recent years, Ireland did not follow these countries into recession as we might have done in the past.  Output rose by about 2 per cent and employment held up very well in a difficult year.  This shows the increased resilience of the Irish economy to unfavourable external developments.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of Government policy continues to be to promote the fundamental conditions for raising growth in income and employment by improving all aspects of our competitiveness. Tackling unemployment and involuntary emigration is a main priority of policies set out successively in the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The significant increase in private sector non-agricultural employment achieved over the past few years is a measure of the success of these policies. We are well placed to record further gains as the international economy improves.</P>

      <P>As I indicated last week when commenting <Col N="1456" /> on the end-March revenue and expenditure returns, although unemployment has been growing more rapidly than anticipated at the time of the budget, I do not expect that the total number on the live register will increase to 300,000 during 1992.  However, given the large numbers likely to join the labour force over the period ahead, unemployment could reach such levels during 1993 unless employment grows quickly or net emigration resumes.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I expect employment to increase this year compared with 1991.  In so far as higher unemployment reflects an increase in the labour force rather than a reduction in employment no loss of actual revenue arises.  The additional full-year cost of social welfare payments for each extra 1,000 persons on the live register is a little above £3 million.  While such costs would not make achievement of the Government's budgetary strategy any easier, that strategy will remain in place notwithstanding the course of unemployment.</P>
      <P>As regards new initiatives to help create additional jobs in either the public or the private sector, I would repeat my reply to a Question by Deputy Spring on 24 March last:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The broad thrust of the Government's strategy for expanding economic activity and employment is as set out successively in the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> That strategy is working.  It has restored employment growth and is set, as international activity picks up, to underpin further expansion of sustainable jobs.  The Government acknowledge, however, that even more rapid economic progress, and employment growth, is required having regard to prevailing high levels of unemployment and prospective increases in demand for jobs.  In this context it has taken a variety of initiatives, including the Industrial Policy Review Group, the Task Force on <Col N="1457" /> Employment and the Tourism Task Force.</P>
    <P>On the Government's initiative, to further assist in strengthening the employment growth of the economy, an all-party Oireachtas Committee on employment has now been proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital gains arising from the development of rezoned land and land benefiting from public investment are subject to normal capital gains tax.  In my budget last January, I introduced a single capital gains tax rate of 40 per cent which applies to all capital gains with effect from 6 April 1992.  This new single rate is part of the overall Government drive to simplify and reform the tax code, and make it more equitable.  Indeed, a single <Col N="1458" /> rate of capital gains tax was one of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
      <P>The existing method of valuing development land for capital gains tax purposes will remain in place.  This method values development land according to its current use rather than its development potential.  This means that those who speculate in land which has increased in value as a result of rezoning or public investment will continue to incur a greater capital gains tax liability than investors in other assets.</P>
      <P>It is a general feature of our taxation system that revenues from particular sources are not ear-marked for specific objects of expenditure.  Revenue is provided to the Exchequer as a whole, to fund expenditures mandated by the Oireachtas.  However, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, informs me that, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, a planning authority is empowered to attach conditions to planning permissions requiring developers to contribute towards expenditure incurred or to be incurred by the authority on works which will facilitate the proposed development. The decision to attach such conditions and the scale of the contributions required are matters for the planning authority concerned, or for Bord Pleanála on appeal.</P>

      <P>The wording of the Deputy's question is somewhat unclear, but if what he is suggesting is that Ministers should be answerable for the day-to-day activities of State-sponsored bodies I could not agree.  It is as well to recall that one <Col N="1459" /> of the reasons why the State-sponsored sector evolved as it has over the years has been the recognition by successive Governments that, while Ministers should be answerable to the House for the broad policies pursued by State bodies in their areas of responsibility, they can not and should not be answerable for day-to-day activities of these bodies.  Such matters are the responsibility of management, reporting in the first instance to the board of directors. The board is, of course, answerable to the relevant Minister, who, in turn, is answerable to this House.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, the Deputy is endeavouring to ensure that the House is entitled to adequate information about the operations and performance of State-sponsored bodies, then let me say that I share fully the Deputy's concern that there be adequate accountability by State bodies to this House, whether by way of parliamentary questions, legislative safeguards or debate.  There are a number of mechanisms in place to ensure that Ministers in pursuance of their responsibility to the House have access to relevant information in regard to State bodies. These range from statutory limits on and ministerial approval of borrowing, to appointment of directors, approval of capital expenditure, establishment or acquisition of subsidiaries and submission of annual and interim reports and accounts.  In many cases, authority is delegated, subject to agreed limits.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing, commercial State bodies are, of course, answerable to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored bodies in relation to their reports and accounts and operational results.  The committee also examine common issues in relation to board responsibility, structures and organisation, accountability and financing as well as the relationship of commercial State bodies with central Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The amount allocated in the Office of Public Works Vote for 1991 for the refurbishment works at the National Gallery was in fact £1.2 million.  At that stage the total estimated cost of the project was £5 million. The Deputy will recall that in mid-1991 there were strong indications of a budget overrun.  In response to this the Government decided to hold back a number of projects, and one of those held back was the refurbishment of the National Gallery.</P>
      <P>Following a submission by the Office of Public Works, the Department of Finance have now sanctioned an upper limit of £6 million for this project, the first instalment of £1 million being in the Office of Public Works Vote for 1992. The tendering process has actually commenced and it is hoped to have a contractor on site later this year.  The works will involve alterations throughout the basement of the building together with the refurbishment of all galleries in the 1968 wing, including the installation of a new air conditioning system in this wing.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works are currently carrying out the rewiring of the Custom House including the installation of emergency lighting and smoke detection systems in the escape routes.  The estimated cost of this work is £900,000 which is being met from the Office of Public Works Vote.</P>
      <P>General maintenance and refurbishment of the interior of the building is the responsibility of the occupying Departments, namely the Department of the Environment and the Revenue Commissioners (Customs &amp; Excise).  I understand that the Department of the Environment, through the Office of Public Works, are arranging for refurbishment of certain areas of the building at an estimated cost of £200,000.</P>
      <P>Any work carried out would be to the standard generally appropriate to offices occupied by the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the good work done by charities, I am afraid I could not agree to the introduction of such a relief.  The relief would be contrary to tax policy as it would narrow the tax base.

      <P>The primary mechanism for addressing the effects of socio-economic deprivation in primary schools is the disadvantaged areas scheme which provides special teaching assistance and extra funding to schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present under the scheme, a total of 225 additional over-quota teaching posts have been allocated to 206 schools.  In the majority of cases such posts are dedicated to individual schools.  However, 21 schools enjoy more than one over-quota <Col N="1472" /> post, while 13 schools share seven of the posts.</P>
    <P>Schools are allowed a certain latitude in their use of these extra posts so as to enable them to be applied to maximum advantage and this may include an element of home-school-liaison work.</P>
    <P>All the schools mentioned receive supplementary funding which in the current school year amounted to £17 per pupil. A further four schools also received this funding but were not allocated over-quota posts because of their low enrolments.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above supports, a special home-school-liaison scheme provides full-time and locally based co-ordinators to groups of schools in areas of particular disadvantage.  To date, a total of 45 co-ordinators have been put in place covering 80 selected schools.</P>
    <P>Schools seeking disadvantaged status are assessed and prioritised as to need on the basis of socio-economic and educational indicators including such factors as unemployment levels, local authority housing, medical card holders and information on basic literacy and numeracy. In addition, in assessing the relative levels of disadvantage among applicant schools, account is taken of prevailing pupil teacher ratios.</P>

      <P>The ordinary fees payable by external, (i.e. non-school), candidates for entry to the leaving certificate examination are as follows: £41 for one subject; £80 for two subjects and £115 for three or more subjects.</P>
      <P>In regard to (b) where the parent or guardian of a school candidate repeating the examination is the holder of a current medical card only the ordinary fee payable by first-time candidates applies.  In addition the course fee of £100 is waived.</P>
      <P>The following reduced fees apply where an external candidate has not sat the examination previously, or has taken only one or two subjects previously, or is the holder of a current medical card or is dependent on a parent, or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card: £15 for one subject; £28 for two subjects, and £41 for three or more subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the reliefs outlined for &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; and external leaving certificate candidates, my Department also implement a scheme to provide alleviation of fees in the case of any pupil attending school who is experiencing particular hardship.  For this purpose a total of £360,000 has been allocated to recognised schools and vocational education committees in respect of the 1992 examinations. The amount of the reduction in the case of any individual pupil concerned under the scheme is determined at the discretion of the school authorities subject to the total amount of such deductions not exceeding the specified amount already notified to each school. As the amount of the reduction applied to individual pupils is determined by the <Col N="1474" /> school authority my Department do not have a figure for the number of candidates who may have had their fees waived in 1991.</P>
    <P>In regard to (c) and (d) it is considered reasonable that people should be required to make a contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources for the conduct of the examinations, subject to alleviation in the case of hardship.  It should be borne in mind that the amount collected in examination fees covers only part of the cost of running the certificate examinations.</P>

      <P>I understand from the North Eastern Health Board that the method of delivery of dental services in County Meath is currently being changed from one of a demand service to one which targets the first and sixth classes in primary schools. This strategy is in line with the policy of the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The rationale behind this strategy is scientifically based.  Between 80 and 90 per cent of first class have their first permanent molars erupted and therefore are at the optimum age to apply fissure sealants before caries have occurred.  The sixth class are on average 12 years of age and have just erupted their second permanent molars which are then at the most appropriate time for application of fissure sealant.  Sixth class is also chosen to ensure the child is screened for any defects which will be dealt with even after the child has left national school.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that this strategy will be fully implemented in County Meath in the school year 1992-93.</P>
      <P>Of course, in addition, the North Eastern Health Board provide an emergency service for the relief of pain or sepsis.</P>

      <P>The law relating to the powers of inspectors of my Department is contained in section 114 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, a copy of which I am circulating in the Official Report for the Deputy's perusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking my inspectors have power to enter at all reasonable times, any premises where people are employed or where records relating to employment are kept.  They may do so for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the law relating to the payment of PRSI contributions, the keeping of prescribed records by employers and the payment of benefits by my Department.  They may interview any persons found on the premises, either alone or in the presence of others and obtain statements from such persons in relation to their employment. The law also places an obligation on any person on the premises such as employers or employees to furnish to an inspector all such information and produce for inspection all such registers, cards, wages sheets, records of wages and any other documents as the inspector may reasonably require for the purposes of an inspection.  There are heavy penalties for <Col N="1490" /> the obstruction or wilful delay of an inspector.  Taken in the context of section 114 as a whole, the power to enter any place or premises implies a power to enter any part of such premises within reason.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can see that the powers vested in my inspectors are very wide ranging.  However, they are limited by the requirement that they must be exercised with reasonableness at all times and in the training of such inspectors the practice of restraint and discretion is constantly stressed.</P>
    <P>Social welfare inspectors do not deal with the PAYE affairs of employers and they are only concerned with PAYE records in so far as they impinge on social welfare matters.</P>
    <P>Extract from Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Section 114:</i>
    </P>

      <P>Self-employed persons became insured under the social insurance system for pension purposes with effect from 6 April 1988.  Contributions at the class S rate are payable by this group and provide cover for old age (contributory) and widow's and orphans pensions.  Class S contributions do not provide cover for retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The whole area of entitlement to pensions, including the issue of retirement pensions for the self-employed, is being examined by the National Pensions Board in the context of its final report on a national pensions system.  I expect to receive the board's report in the near future and the matter will be considered further in this context.</P>

      <P>The Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Bill, 1992 is at an advanced stage of preparation and it is my intention to introduce <Col N="1494" /> the Bill in the Oireachtas in the coming session.</P>
      <P>In the course of the review of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 submissions from many interested parties were received.  Among the variety of issues raised in the submissions was a proposal to amend the Act to include, in the list of automatically unfair grounds for dismissal at section 6 (2) of the Act, dismissal for reasons of the sexual orientation of the employee.  As with all the issues raised, this proposal is being given full consideration by my Department. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to indicate at this stage the likely contents of the proposed Bill in advance of the circulation of the final text to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The employment incentive scheme has, since the end of 1989, been targeted at the long term unemployed over 25, early school leavers and other disadvantaged persons. This limit on participation resulted from the recommendations of an ESRI report on the scheme prepared at the request of the Department of Labour.</P>
      <P>The decrease in the numbers assisted under the scheme in 1991 compared with 1986 reflects the targeting of the scheme on those with particular difficulties in securing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the new employment subsidy scheme which has been operational since the beginning of February 1992 is in general aimed at encouraging the recruitment of persons who have been on the live register for at least eight weeks.  Some 210 persons have been recruited under the scheme and a further 1,100 have been approved for recruitment. <Col N="1495" /> The rate of recruitment has also increased.</P>
