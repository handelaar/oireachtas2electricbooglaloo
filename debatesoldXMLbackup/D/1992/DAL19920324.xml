      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if, in regard to comments made during his speech to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis on the possibility of discussions with other party leaders on the establishment of a joint co-ordinating campaign with full Government backing for the Maastricht referendum, he will outline whether he envisages such a campaign providing for information on both the positive and negative implications for Ireland of the Maastricht agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's assessment that Ireland stands to gain from wholehearted participation in a union with the characteristics, policy balance and content of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.  As I said in my address at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, the Government will be urging the electorate to give a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On an issue of this importance, it would, I believe, be desirable to secure as far as possible cross-party support to ensure such a positive result and it is <Col N="1030" /> against this background that I indicated I was willing to discuss with other party leaders the establishment of a joint co-ordinating committee for the campaign with full Government backing.</P>
    <P>The Government White Paper will provide a comprehensive and factual outline and an objective assessment of the Treaty.  I will be arranging to have copies of the Treaty itself freely available for inspection in public places and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be publishing and giving wide circulation to a briefer and more popular version of the White Paper setting out the issues on which the people will be asked to vote.  It is envisaged that these arrangements which will be put in place soon will give every citizen the possibility of taking a balanced and informed view of the issues in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate when he expects the referendum to take place and how soon he expects the information he proposes to provide to be made available to the electorate? Also, does the Taoiseach intend to approach the leaders of the Opposition parties with regard to the co-ordinated campaign which he mentioned.  Furthermore, does he intend to publish soon his decision with regard to the Protocol relating to the Eighth Amendment and what wording, if any, will be used to amend it or, indeed, does he intend to delete it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not yet decided the date on which the referendum will be held.  The White Paper is before Government at the moment for consideration.  The briefer and more popular version will be circulated by the Department of Foreign Affairs after the Government have approved the White Paper for publication. That version will give the balanced view of the pros and cons of the Treaty and it will be available to every citizen to make their own judgment on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach <Col N="1031" /> what is the latest feasible date on which the referendum could take place in view of our EC obligations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will certainly hold the referendum as soon as it is practically possible to do so when other obstacles are out of the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Without unduly wishing to draw attention to the fact that the Taoiseach has not answered the question I asked him, may I repeat the question? What is the latest feasible date, in view of our EC obligations, on which this referendum can take place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>In relation to the Protocol which the Government had inserted in the Maastricht Treaty, may I ask the Taoiseach if the Government have completed their consideration of the proposed amendment or deletion of that Protocol?</P>
      <P>Have they completed their deliberations and what position are they taking?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has <Col N="1032" /> indicated that the Government are considering a White Paper on the Maastricht Treaty and are also planning a more popular version of the White Paper for general distribution.  Surely he accepts that the question of the Protocol relating to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution is a matter on which the people will want information.  Are the Government at present considering an amendment to or the deletion of that Protocol in parallel with consideration of the White Paper?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I make the point that my question relates to the Maastricht Treaty and the fact that the Taoiseach has indicated his interest in having a co-ordinated campaign that all parties in the House would support?  The Protocol is a significant factor in the Maastricht Treaty.  I simply want some information.  If we are expected to support&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very distinct and separate matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that in the Taoiseach's reply to the question he said that he regarded it as important that the Maastricht Treaty be approved by the people, could I ask the Taoiseach whether he agrees that the clarification of the issues of information, counselling and the right to travel may well be a crucial factor in inducing many people to either vote for the Treaty or against it?  Does the Taoiseach agree, therefore, that the Government should <Col N="1033" /> be urgently concerned to resolve those issues so that the people may be satisfied on the issues and will vote on the basic economic principles which underlie the Treaty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am sorry, but the Taoiseach said in his reply to the question that he regarded it as of the utmost importance that the Maastricht Treaty be approved by the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that reply, I am raising the question whether the Taoiseach agrees that the question of clarity of the position on information and counselling must be a vital factor in influencing many people whether they will or will not support the Treaty and, consequently, whether the Taoiseach intends to address that situation and, if so, how.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That question invites a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a perfectly fair supplementary question, arising from the Taoiseach's reply that he regarded it as a matter of importance that the Maastricht Treaty be approved by the Irish people. My question arises very fairly as a supplementary question from the wording of the Taoiseach's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter that is under consideration.  The Government are well aware of the importance of the matter and it is getting the urgent attention it deserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two brief supplementary questions.  First, does the Taoiseach agree that the proposal to make the Treaty &mdash; a 400-page document &mdash; available in public places is not sufficient? Does he not agree that a limited number of copies should be available for members of the general public who ask for it?  Secondly, in view of the considerable opposition to the Maastricht Treaty by a number of groups outside the House, would the Taoiseach indicate that RTE will give equal broadcasting time to both sides to the debate, the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side and the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; side?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to answer, please.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach has told the House that the Maastricht Treaty must be approved by the parliaments of all members states before the end of the year and that those parliaments must presumably be asked to approve the Treaty with its protocols appended in their final form, could I ask the Taoiseach what is the final feasible date on which an amendment to any of the protocols must be agreed at Community level so as to allow sufficient time for the parliaments of all member states to approve the Treaty before the deadline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Present information would suggest that the first country to hold a debate on the Treaty is Denmark, and that is due to take place in the very near future.  Other information would suggest that the same pressure of time is not on us in relation to other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chairperson of the <Col N="1035" /> Second Commission on the Status of Women, High Court Judge Mella Carroll, recommended that information and counselling be incorporated by the Government in the new wording of that accord to enable it passage.  Given that fact, can I ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief, a Cheann Comhairle.  Is it not a fact that the Protocol is part of the Treaty and that therefore the Danish Parliament cannot discuss the Treaty before Ireland had indicated the changes we wish to make to the Protocol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During my address to my party's Ard-Fheis, I said that the European Community offers a context in which we can build on the assets of this island, and its people, while recognising differences and diversity.  In this context, I also said that I would publish shortly a study on the prospects for North-South economic co-operation against the background of the Single Market, as a stimulus to intensified contacts and discussions.  A substantial study of these issues has been completed and it is my intention that this study, which is undergoing some updating, would form the basis of the publication to which I referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The study was carried out in 1990, and I think that the Deputy would recall tabling questions about it in earlier years.  The study is a 200-page study of the overall implications of the Single Market for a total island economy. It is now being updated and as soon as that is done it will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all trying to maximise the opportunities for the development of an island economy.  In that regard, the Minister for Industry and Commerce met his opposite number in Northern Ireland, Mr. Needham, at the Anglo-Irish Conference on 6 March in order to process the whole discussion in that regard.  The Conference agreed arrangements for officials to undertake further work to <Col N="1037" /> encourage cross-Border trade and co-operation.</P>

      <P>The concept of a citizens' charter, which would articulate and spell out the rights of citizens <i>vis-á-vis</i> the providers of public services, is a good one.  The Minister for Health has already proposed a patient's charter.  I propose to ask the Institute of Public Administration to examine the concept in conjunction with various Departments, State agencies and utilities, with the Ombudsman and Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to see whether it would be possible to introduce a charter, or charters, here that would be suited to our conditions.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied with the security arrangements at the various locations and this is kept under constant review.  Where improvements are identified such as those at Daingean and Inchicore, they have been carried out.  I can assure the Deputy that the views and recommendations expressed in the report of the Board of Visitors are always given due consideration by both my Department and the National Museum authorities.</P>
    <P>The Director of the National Museum advises that because of the diverse nature of the collections and the different environmental conditions required in relation to their protection and preservation, it is not considered by the museum authorities that a central repository for storage is either practical or desirable.  He considers that such a repository would carry increased risks in the areas of the fire and security and would also cut across the museum's objective of having storage and exhibitions close together.</P>
    <P>The proposed development of a decorative arts museum at the Custom House Docks will make further storage space available.  In addition, a study is currently being prepared by the National Museum and the Office of Public Works on the question of the overall accommodation requirements of the museum. This study will include a detailed examination of current storage facilities as well as office and exhibition space.</P>

      <P>I welcome the indication given by the Minister of State that serious consideration will be given to the question of storage.  Will the Minister of State agree that the use of Army barracks at Kilkenny and elsewhere for the minding and safe keeping of part of our national collection is totally inappropriate? Does he accept the views of the directors, contained in the 1989 report, the Museum's storage conditions do not meet basic requirements to protect against deterioration?  Does he accept that major work has to be done in this area and that it requires urgent attention by his Department?</P>

      <P>I accept that much work has to be done.  The national collection of carriages is currently at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham and Stephens' Army Barracks in Kilkenny.  Their collection contains 19 carriages, seven of which are stored at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, five at the Army barracks in Kilkenny and five at Daingean.  The Lord Chancellor's coach is on display in Newbridge House and the Daniel O'Connell coach is being restored by the Office of Public Works prior to being sent on loan to Derrynane.  Much work is going on.  My general approach is that storage and display go hand in hand.  My earlier remarks in regard to a central repository are valid in that there is a risk in terms of security and fire if all these items are stored together.  The study being undertaken will be completed in a matter of weeks and we will be in a better position to consider what should be done in the future.</P>

      <P>I fail to understand <Col N="1049" /> how items of historical interest become flammable just because they are stored in the same room.  Will the Minister of State indicate the plans in regard to exhibition and display at Daingean, Kilkenny, Inchicore and elsewhere?  He said that these repositories are being maintained on the basis that the items will be ultimately displayed.  Will the Minsiter of State accept that there is a need for rationalisation in regard to the storage of these items, not perhaps in a single central repository but in modern conditions which will protect the various items? Concern has been expressed by the board of directors in regard to this aspect.</P>

      <P>As I said, much work is going on in this area.  For example, there are plans to develop conservation laboratories. There are many excellent proposals in place.  With regard to the question of plans, as the Deputy is probably aware it is proposed to develop a decorative arts museum at the Custom House Docks.  This is one of the options which will be available for storage and display.  While there are many plans in the pipeline I accept that much work remains to be done.  The study which is being undertaken at present will address those issues.

In Daingean there is a collection of national folklife including dressers, public house equipment, kitchens, farm instruments, etc.  I have already said that five carriages are stored in Kilkenny.

Are there plans to relocate them in developing local museums, which would be a step in the right direction, as there is an upsurge of interest in local museums from the point of view of tourism, etc?  It would be a good move as some of the articles may have originated in an are in which a local museum is located.</P>

Why did it take three years to put together a 53-page document?  Will he also indicate when the reports for 1990 and 1991 will be published?

      <P>The National Library is open six days a week, including three late night openings and Saturday morning.  It is not intended to extend the opening hours of the library from their present level in the foreseeable future because of the considerable extra cost involved.  I am satisfied that, within the level of resources available at this time of constraint on the public finances, the National Library is providing an excellent service to the public.  The present opening hours were arrived at following a survey of the requirements of the library's readers over a period of months and are considered to be the most equitable possible in the present circumstances.</P>

      <P>I agree that an excellent staff provide a limited service.  Is the Minister of State not aware that the National Library is closed on Tuesday mornings, Wednesday mornings, Thursday evenings, Friday evenings, Saturday afternoons, Saturday evenings and all day Sunday?  Would he agree that that is a very limited level of accessibility for people from the country who may wish to carry out some studies while in Dublin?  It is not good enough to have such restrictions because our National Library is there for the public.</P>

      <P>I have outlined the present opening hours and the plans for the future.  May I point out to Deputy McCartan, and others, that it is estimated that it would cost approximately £74,000 if the Library were to remain open until 9 p.m. on five nights instead of the present late opening on three nights. That would necessitate additional staffing of one assistant keeper, two library assistants, four library attendants and one science and art attendant.  Additional staff would be required if we made changes in the opening hours.</P>

      <P>The Law Reform Commission, in their report on child sexual abuse, recommended that there should be no change in the present law of incest, and I have no proposals to amend the 1908 Act.  The law on indecent assault was amended by the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  The Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992, now awaiting Committee Stage in this House, contains a number of provisions which will facilitate proof of paternity in incest cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that arising out of a case heard in Waterford, referred to in the question, there was widespread concern that charges of incest were dismissed because the court was not able to rely on a birth certificate as proof <Col N="1063" /> of paternity and the person alleged to have committed that offence did not have to give evidence and, as a result the charges were dismissed in a way that was perceived as unsatisfactory?  Is the Minister aware that his suggestion in his reply, and his response to the Ceann Comhairle some weeks ago, that section 5 of the Criminal Evidence Bill will resolve this difficulty in future cases is not necessarily correct?  Will the Minister confirm that the necessary amendments will be made to the Bill as it goes through the House to ensure that in future when a charge of incest is brought and the alleged victim gives evidence as to who is her father the accused will have to give evidence in response, that the case will not be dismissed without the accused having to go into the witness box?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 24, 31, 37, 42, 44, 47, 56 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>First, on the subject of statistics, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the 1991 crime statistics are not finalised, but that the indications are that the level of crime increased last year.  Official figures for 1991 will not be available until later this year when the Commissioner's annual report on crime will be published. While I cannot, therefore, confirm the accuracy of the figures contained in the article to which the Deputy refers, I can say that present indications are that the final figures will show an overall increase of the order of 7 to 8 per cent.</P>
      <P>Nobody could pretend that an overall increase in crime figures in any year &mdash; whatever its magnitude &mdash; is anything other than a disappointment.  However, it is necessary, in the interest of balance, to bear certain considerations in mind when looking at gross crime figures for any particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention the following points in particular.  First, it is vitally important in assessing the real sigificance of movements in gross crime figures in a particular year to realise that they include offences ranging from extremely serious crimes against the person to crimes which, though still a source of concern, are far less serious in nature.  The full significance of movements in the overall statistics &mdash; as a measure of real changes in the actual law and order situation &mdash; can be gauged only when all of the detailed figures are available for scrutiny. Secondly, it is extremely important when looking at crime figures to examine not just the movements that take place from one year to the next, though that, in itself, is obviously a perfectly valid exercise, but also to look at the pattern over longer time spans.  Even with last year's trend, which as I say was disappointing, the overall position is still far better than it was some years ago.  Thirdly, the growth in crime is, sadly, a worldwide <Col N="1066" /> phenomenon.  The experience in this regard in many Western countries, which are much better placed than we are in terms of resources, is far worse than ours. It is wrong to look upon crime increase simply as a matter of slippage of effort on behalf of the Government or the law enforcement agencies.  The reality is that the number of crimes attempted or committed in any year is something which is determined first and foremost by those members of the community who choose the way of crime.  They have parents, they belong to families, they have friends and neighbours, many of whom know about them and about what they do.  That is why it is vitally important that members of the community who are in a position to dissuade those inclined towards crime or in a position to assist by means of intervention during the child's formative years, parents, teachers and others, or are otherwise in a position to assist the Garda in the prevention and detection of crime, should do so.  There is, I am glad to say, a growing consciousness among various professionals dealing with children of the importance of early intervention and help.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention to the foregoing considerations only in the interest of balance and certainly not to give the impression that last year's crime increase is something that can be looked upon with complacency.  Far from it, in fact.  I can assure the House that as soon as it became apparent that an upward trend was emerging, immediate steps were taken to address the situation.  I have had consultations with the Garda Commissioner on the practical measures which can be taken immediately to deal with crime and I can report that a wide range of plans have been implemented, with success, on the Garda operational front.  For obvious reasons I cannot go into detail on all the practical Garda measures which are now being taken but I can assure the House that the indications so far are positive.</P>
    <P>I would also refer Deputies to the 1992 law enforcement package which was published in December 1991 and which outlined the approach and the measures that <Col N="1067" /> will be taken this year in preserving law and order and protecting the community against crime.  I shall ensure that this package which deals with vitally important measures such as neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes, the development of Garda community policing arrangements, the Garda schools programme and the juvenile liaison officer scheme, is fully implemented during the year.</P>
    <P>I am also looking forward to receiving in the near future the first report of the high-level interdepartmental group on urban crime who are now engaged in an examination of the situation in urban areas particularly hard hit by criminal activity.  The establishment of this group, of course, reflected an acknowledgment of the fact that crime is a multi-dimensional issue.  It is not something which can be approached simply from a police and law and order perspective. All international experience fully bears this out.</P>
    <P>The crime situation is being kept under constant review by the Garda authorities and they &mdash; and I &mdash; will ensure that all appropriate action will be taken to ensure that the problem is effectively tackled.</P>

      <P>I am particularly pleased that the Minister accepts the sentiments expressed in the question and that there has been an increase in the level of crime, about which he is concerned, and which will probably work out at 8 per cent. However it will give the people who live in urban and rural communities no joy to learn that comparisons are being made with the position in other countries within the European Community or elsewhere in the world; we are concerned about what is happening here.  Would the Minister indicate to the House what he proposes to do when the figures are made available?  Will he put proposals before the House and afford the House an opportunity to debate and discuss the substantial increase in the level of crime in urban and rural areas as it is a very serious problem?</P>

      <P>I propose to answer the three Private Notice Questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have informed me that at 09.00 hours this morning the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna informed them of an incident which occurred at 2.37 a.m. local time in unit 3 of a four-unit nuclear plant situated near St. Petersburg, formerly known as Leningrad. The plant is of the same type as Chernobyl. The incident involved damage to and subsequent leakage from a fuel channel in the plant.  The reactor was shut down in accordance with emergency procedures and indications are that it is being successfully cooled down.  The incident has been classified as Level 3 on the seven-step International Nuclear Event <Col N="1070" /> Scale.  Level 3 indicates that there has been a very small release to the local environment but public exposure is at a fraction of prescribed limits.  On the basis of present information no risk is posed to anybody outside the local area.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board will be continuously monitoring the situation and the public will be kept informed as further information comes to hand.</P>
    <P>At this juncture there are no grounds for calling for action at EC level in this instance.  I have no doubt, however, that the situation is being monitored at EC and individual member state level and that specific action will be considered if the situation should warrant it.  The Community is involved in ongoing measures, of course, to improve the safety of East European nuclear facilities.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in place in Ireland to monitor radioactivity levels and to give appropriate advice and assistance to the public, if the need for such measures should arise.  At this juncture having regard to the information available, it is not anticipated that any such measures will be necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister two specific questions.  Are his Department, through the International Atomic Energy Agency, satisfied that they have full access to all the necessary information to allow him and others give the assurances he has given to the House here?  Would the Minister not accept that along with the Chernobyl incident, this incident indicates a very serious problem with eastern European installations? Does the Minister believe that adequate attention is being given to this matter at EC level so as to reduce the risk of future accidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are relying on the International Atomic Energy Agency for <Col N="1071" /> information, and to be kept up to date on investigations which they are carrying out into this incident.  The information I had before this incident was that operational procedures with regard to these reactors had been changed and that those changes were in place.  Modifications to their design had been completed in some cases and were well advanced in all the others.  The Nuclear Energy Board consider that these changes will make the reactors more stable and improve safety status.  I am not saying that we can be fully satisfied with these measures, and if these reactors cannot reach acceptable levels of safety, they should be closed down.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that we will keep the situation under constant review, and if there is need for any further action we will take whatever action we can as members of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  It is my intention to keep the public informed as to what information comes our way with regard to this incident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the reactor was of the same type as the one at Chernobyl.  What does the Minister mean by his reference to the accident being of a Level 3 type, on a seven step scale?  How does that compare to what happened at Chernobyl?  Has the Minister put in place precautionary measures that could be immediately implemented in the event of the accident proving to be worse than it originally appeared, as was the case in Chernobyl? Is the Minister aware of the number of Irish citizens who are in or near St. Petersburg who might be affected by this accident?  Are there any plans in place from the point of view of safeguarding their interests in the event of concern about the accident becoming more serious?</P>

The scale is from one to seven, with one being the least dangerous.  An event at seven on this scale would be a major accident similar to what happened at Chernobyl in 1986. The top four points on the scale refer to nuclear accidents and the bottom three refer to incidents.  No. 3 on the scale refers to a serious incident.  A similar incident happened in Vandellos in Spain in 1989.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the continuing long delay in setting up the Irish Radiological Protection Institute to take over from the Nuclear Energy Board is not what we want and that we need some action?  The Minister did not reply to my question as to whether he had improved the monitoring and information system since 1986. Will he undertake to review the situation on Friday, before he goes home, and if this incident is not totally closed, to instruct the Nuclear Energy Board to keep staff on hand at the weekend to deal with public inquiries and with monitoring? This was not done at the time of the Chernobyl accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House accepts that facilities and arrangements that were in place at the time of the Chernobyl accident were not adequate.  That has been dealt with since then.  An emergency plan for nuclear accidents based on the lessons learned from the Chernobyl accident has been drawn up by an interdepartmental committee and has been already approved by the Government.  That plan will be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It involves the deployment of a network of radiation monitoring devices around the country in order to detect any increase in radiation and pinpoint the areas seriously affected.  A system is provided to enable notification of an accident abroad to be received and then the rapid <Col N="1073" /> calling together of a co-ordinating body. Following notification of, or the detection of raised radiation levels, the machinery is now in place to direct the response and the identification of the roles and functions of the various Government Departments and other bodies in the response to such an emergency. Much of the necessary equipment has been purchased and is operational. The Radiological Protection Institute will be established as and from 1 April.  The new board have already been notified of their appointments.  This does not make any difference however, because they are merely assuming the expanded role of the Nuclear Energy Board.  The staff will be available at all times on a seven day a week basis to continue to monitor this and any other situation that arises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the six Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm to the House that the mv <i>Havelet</i> has arrived in Roscoff and the French authorities have commenced their inspection process.  In addition the Bahamian authorities have confirmed that they will investigate the incident which occurred at sea.  I have also directed that Captain C. Davies of the Marine Survey Office of my Department travel to meet the vessel and crew after the Port State Control inspection is completed and continue our investigations. Following receipt of these various inspection reports I will consider whether an investigation under the Merchant Shipping Acts is warranted in this case.</P>
      <P>The background to the case is as follows. On Sunday last at around 05.00 hours the mv <i>Havelet</i> bound from Cork to Roscoff got into difficulties and had to return to Cork, after 08.00 hours.  The vessel had 175 passengers and 55 crew members on board for the voyage as well as 15 trucks and 21 cars on the car deck. Injuries to some passengers have been reported in the media and extensive damage was caused to cars and freight units on board.</P>
      <P>On my instruction, a surveyor of the Marine Survey Office of the Department of the Marine visited the vessel on Sunday to carry out an inspection.  The surveyor, having spent two hours on board and some time alongside, left the vessel on Sunday night with the intention of resuming his inspection on Monday morning.  He was satisfied about the soundness of the vessel, but he assumed that in all the circumstances of the incident that had taken place at sea the vessel would have remained in port, facilitating the completion of his inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> Before this could take place, however, the vessel sailed for Roscoff on Monday morning.  It is my view that the departure of the vessel was regrettable in all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>On Monday morning the Secretary of my Department at my request contacted the French maritime authorities who confirmed that they would have the vessel inspected under Port State Control on its arrival in France.  Port State Control is carried out by European countries under a Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control inaugurated in Paris in 1982.  Port State Control involves, <i>inter alia</i>; inspection of vessels Safety Convention Certificates relating to ship construction, loadline, safety equipment, oil pollution, manning; and the inspection includes a detailed inspection of the vessel, its bridge, charts, nautical publication, life saving appliances, fire fighting appliances, ships accommodation, store rooms, galley, engine room and ancillary spaces.  The vessel decks, cargo equipment, mooring arrangements etc. are also checked in detail.</P>
    <P>On the question of compensation for loss or damage suffered by passengers this, of course, is a civil matter between the passengers and the ferry company and not something in which I, as Minister for the Marine, have a direct function. My Department have discussed the concerns of passengers with the company, and the company have promised to set out the recourse available to aggrieved passengers.  I expect details shortly.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for safety at sea, I am naturally concerned about safety standards on board ferries operating in and out of Ireland.  All such ferries adhere to the international safety standards, including evacuation systems, as laid down by the International Maritime Organisation.  Irish registered ferries are required to undergo an annual inspection by my Department's Marine Survey Office for the renewal of their Passenger and Safety Certificates.  Foreign-registered vessels using Irish ports may be inspected under the terms of the IMO's Safety of Life at Sea Convention and also the Memorandum of Understanding <Col N="1077" /> on Port State Control to which Ireland is a contracting party.</P>
    <P>As this case has dramatically unfolded, one cannot but be affected by the obvious distress and upset which passengers experienced.  Our first responsibility in any incident is to reassure passengers about their security and safety.  I feel that there is room for the development of a code of practice which places passengers concerns at a high priority.  This is an issue which I propose to pursue with all the ferry companies when the facts of this incident are fully known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that only two weeks ago we discussed in this House the question of insurance in regard to incidents at sea, will the Minister accept that he has a very obvious duty to people who go on holiday from this country and to those who come here on holiday, using the ferry services, to ensure that the highest possible safety standards are complied with?  Will the Minister confirm whether his Department's inspector found during his inspection of the hold of the ship that the required stabilisation procedures were in place?  Can he give an assurance that in future all persons using the ferry services to or from this country will be able to travel in safety?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that the <i>mv Havelet</i> which was chartered by Brittany Ferries normally does a one-and-a-half hour sailing from the Channel Islands to Cherbourg and was totally unsuited to this 22-hour journey?  Will the Minister also confirm that there was no disruption of the continental sailings operated by Irish Ferries over that weekend and that it is outrageous that Brittany Ferries should claim this as an act of God?  Will the Minister ensure in immediate and direct discussions with Brittany Ferries that the passengers and hauliers <Col N="1078" /> will be fully compensated?  Will he review flawed procedures in relation to marine safety?</P>

I accept the point that no other Ferry companies experienced problems on that day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there appeared to be a very serious lack of communication between the Cork harbour master and the representative of his Department?  The harbour master stated that he was perfectly satisfied.  What was the representative of the Minister for the Marine doing if he had no communication with the Cork harbour master?  In view of the fact that a weather expert from University College Cork who was travelling on the ferry stated that the listing had taken place much sooner than reported, will the Minister institute his own investigation into this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I instigated an investigation immediately and I am continuing with a further investigation.  The first investigation relates to the soundness and seaworthiness of the vessel.  The longer investigation deals with all the details relating to the incident and the report. Even today we are receiving full co-operation from Brittany Ferries.  My Department received today copies of reports of the incidents on board, statements which are relevant to the incident as it occurred from the master, the chief officer, and the duty engineer.  We are getting this co-operation and we will be examining the matter very thoroughly.</P>

      <P>I would put it to the Minister that in a banana republic a ship which had caused such trauma and loss would not have been allowed leave in such a fashion.  Why did the Minister not issue a direction on Sunday night to make sure that the vessel stayed in port? Second, is the Minister not aware that according to some of my constituents who were on board the vessel and went through the horrifying experience, no warning drill took place when the passengers boarded the vessel and that, furthermore, for a number of hours after the vessel came into port the Cork fire brigade had to continue to spray water on the vessel because of the danger from petrol that spilled from damaged cars?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to agree that the Minister is copping out of his responsibilities. The company concerned are a responsible company and if the Minister had asked them on Sunday night not to sail until the investigation was concluded they would not have done so.  The Minister is gravely negligent in this matter.  Is he aware that the ship was ten hours late in sailing and that there are reports of words between lorry drivers and the crew of the ship as to how the lorries would be tied up?  Has the Minister or his Department spoken to the lorry drivers and the passengers on board?  He had not done so up to 1 p.m. today.  Does he know that there are reports that the ship listed badly when passing Roches Point and continued to list?  Nobody except the captain of the ship speaks of an act of God?  Has the Minister spoken to all the passengers on board and all the crew, or how does he propose to do this as the ship is now in France?  Has he sent an inspector from his Department to France to speak to the crew members there?</P>

      <P>I have outlined the position in law.  The inspector had no authority to detain the vessel once it was found to be seaworthy, and he had completed that part of his investigation.  As a matter of interest, there is some conflict <Col N="1081" /> about the discussions which took place with the inspector after he had been on board in relation to the berthing of the vessel at another point in the harbour. He understood that the vessel would be there for continued examination later in the morning.</P>

Brady: the need for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to re-appoint the Broadcasting Complaints Commission which was the only vehicle available to deal with complaints from the public regarding broadcasting standards; (3) Deputy Dukes: the proposal by the Bush Administration to grant further military aid to the Government of El Salvador, amounting to $35 million for 1992 and $40 million for 1993, in contravention of the spirit of the New York peace accords; (4)  Deputy Cotter: the inclusion of Interregnum funding in the allocation of road grants to the Border counties, the unfairness of the practice and the lack of additionality in the application of this special funding for Border counties; (5) Deputy Nealon: the shortage of nursing staff in St. John's Geriatric Hospital, <Col N="1312" /> Sligo, which has led to a mandate by members of the Irish Nursing Organisation for industrial action in April; (6) Deputy Deenihan: the serious concern in County Kerry regarding the serious oil pollution of the beaches and the severe financial pressure that will result for Kerry council and if he has any plans to provide financial assistance for the council; (7) Deputy Fennell: the serious matter of mental hospital reports which, despite a statutory obligation under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, that the inspector or mental hospitals should annually lay his reports before the Oireachtas, the last one available is for 1982; (8) Deputy Garland: the failure by the Government to respond to the major environmental crisis caused by rotting meat at Creggagh, Strokestown, which seems beyond the capabilities of Roscommon County Council to solve.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform you that my party do not agree to the restriction imposed on the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  The Bill affects the livelihood of up to 40 per cent of the population and it is highly complex, containing many controversial proposals.  If the Government order proceeds, only a tiny fraction of Members will be able to contribute their views on the Bill.  We object to the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand the Government's haste to have the Second Stage of the Bill through the House by midnight this evening.  The Bill is extremely complex and has implications for a large percentage of the population.  The Bill was published only on Thursday and most Members received it on Friday.  If the Taoiseach wants a reasoned discussion in the House then the Government should make provision for the Second Stage debate to continue until Thursday evening at least.  The Labour Party object to the taking of the Bill in such a manner and I am disappointed that the Taoiseach is trying to put it through the House in this fashion.</P>

      <P>Before the House adjourned for St. Patrick's Day, I objected to the fact that the House was not to sit last week.  Specifically in regard to the Social Welfare Bill, I pointed out that little time would be available for consideration of the Bill once the House resumed.  However, I did not expect the Government to attempt to ram the Second Stage of the Bill through in less than five hours.  The Bill has 68 pages and more than 60 sections.  We are not being given enough time to deal with the very serious restrictions that are being applied by the Minister on people's rights under social welfare legislation.  Therefore, I <Col N="1315" /> propose an amendment to item No. (2). I move: &ldquo;That proceedings shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 5 p.m. on Thursday&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to advise the House that the Government do not regard the arrangement as fully satisfactory. Neither does the new Minister. The Bill was circulated on 19 March, in comparison to the last year when the Social Welfare Bill was circulated on 12 March.  Most people would agree that that is reasonable in view of the changed circumstances.  What was generally agreed in discussions between the Whips on the matter was that, because of the Bill's technical nature, more time should be given to the Committee Stage debate than to the Second Stage debate.  As a <Col N="1316" /> Result 14½ hours are being devoted to the Committee Stage debate.  That compares with the time of six and three quarter hours provided last year for the Committee Stage debate and the eleven and a half hours provided the previous year. What has happened is that the time provided for the Second Stage debate has been shortened and the time provided for Committee Stage has been lengthened. Most Deputies would agree, although I am not saying there was any agreement by the Whips in this regard, that more time was required for Committee Stage. More time has been provided.  I am sure all Members recognise that the Bill must be passed by the Seanad by 6 April for implementation.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach if he will give time either today or tomorrow to the Minister for Justice to make a statement to the House on the two deaths which occurred in the Prison Service during the past seven days?  I find it remarkable that my Private Notice Question on the two suicides was not allowed on the basis that the matter was not urgent.

      <P>The Chair is aware that there has been a reference to the special foreign affairs committee. However, the fact that it traditionally established some right to the Order of Business does not mean it will establish a precedent in respect of every other committee which is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>

If it is the desire of the House that that should change, so be it.  The Chair would be delighted to carry out the wishes of the House in that regard.  Until such changes are made it will not be regarded by the Chair as being in order to raise matters connected with committees on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>Until such time as the order changes, I regard it as the responsibility of the Chair to carry out the existing orders.  The fact that the Taoiseach &mdash; I say this in all deference &mdash; might indicate his preparedness to answer does not, <i>ipso facto</i>, make it in order on the Order of Business. <Col N="1323" /> Unfortunately, that is the regulation.</P>

      <P>In the Programme for Government, the Taoiseach is aware there is a promise to review generally the legislation on extradition and that there is also a promise of an interim proposal to meet the requirements of a European Convention.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when that interim proposal, which is to do no more than bring the legislation into line with a provision in the European Convention, will be dealt with?  I asked the Taoiseach's predecessor about this and he referred to some ongoing discussions and negotiations with our nearest partner.  This does not seem to be relevant.  It was clearly indicated in the review of the Programme for Government that this proposal would be on the stocks before the end of last year.  This is an important matter that I think should be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This is my first opportunity of introducing a Social Welfare Bill in this House.  The Bill gives effect, first, to the increases in social welfare payments and other improvements in social welfare schemes provided for in this year's budget.  It provides also for certain changes in social welfare schemes which were announced at the publication of the 1992 Estimates in December last and for a number of other adjustments in the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>On publication of the Bill there was an amount of misinformed comment.  I will deal later with those comments which refer to matters actually provided for in this Bill.  However, some of the comments refer to matters which are not appropriate to this legislation.  The arrangements for retrospective application of equal treatment announced in the budget will be made by regulations and the Government have provided £22 million in 1992 for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The introduction of new conditions for treatment benefits as announced in December last on the publication of the Estimates will be implemented also by way of regulations.  The implementation of the Government decision for the taxation of certain benefit payments is not applicable to this Bill.  The necessary provisions are a matter for inclusion in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Before discussing the detailed provisions of this Bill, I would like to refer to the overall general context in which this legislation is framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Social <Col N="1330" /> Welfare two things in particular have struck me about the social welfare system.  These are, first, the complexity of the system and, secondly, the high and growing level of expenditure which is involved.  Total social welfare expenditure in 1992 will be around £3.36 billion, an increase of £265 million over 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a job to bring that down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure in 1991 was some £283 million above expenditure in 1990.  These levels of increase are due to increasing numbers of recipients of various schemes and the increases in the rates of payments and other improvements which have been provided for.  The social welfare improvements in this year's budget will cost £85 million in 1992 and £162 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The vast bulk of the additional resources for social welfare at budget time go towards improving the general level of basic social welfare payments. This means that the scope for any additional improvements in schemes is limited, unless savings can be found within the system to finance such improvements.  Whether we like it or not, we are faced with a very severe financial situation and all areas of public expenditure have been and are being constrained by these financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The single greatest constraint on the social welfare system is, of course, the level of unemployment.  Rising unemployment increases social welfare expenditure while at the same time reducing the income from PRSI contributions. Expenditure on unemployment payments in 1992 will be around £940 million. Our ability to get to grips with the problem of unemployment is central to our ability to maintain and improve the level of our social welfare services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dilemma facing the Government in the type of situation we find ourselves in is whether to maintain the present system, &ldquo;come hell or high water&rdquo;, unchanged in all respects or to examine the possibilities of redirecting resources <Col N="1331" /> within the system to people on the lowest income levels.  There is a number of measures in this Bill which attempt on a modest scale to do the latter.  They are, as I will outline, specific measures related to specific schemes and the underlying purpose is to target scarce resources in the most effective way towards people in greatest need and to tackle misuse of the system where this occurs.</P>
    <P>I see it as my first priority to ensure that people who depend on social welfare, and particularly those at lower income levels, are protected and, where possible, have their living standards improved.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the complexity of the social welfare system and the multiplicity of schemes and services which now exist.  In this regard, I would like to inform the House that work has already commenced in my Department on a new social welfare consolidation Bill which I am keen to bring before the House by the end of this year.  A new consolidation Bill is overdue in view of the many amendments and extensions to the social welfare system since the last consolidation took place in 1981.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that the complexity I have referred to exists in a system which has evolved under different Governments in response to a wide range of problems and to provide for very diverse groups of people.  Nevertheless, despite the multiplicity of schemes, some people are missed by the system.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there are poverty traps and disincentives within the system. These require to be addressed by specific measures which sometimes add further to the level of complexity.  One of my aims will be to try to ensure that the system caters for everybody who needs it and that it actively encourages enterprise and enables people to improve their situation. A more simplified and streamlined system of benefit entitlement and greater integration of the tax and social welfare systems are a prerequisite for this and I will be actively seeking ways of achieving this.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide <Col N="1332" /> for an increase of 4 per cent from next July in the weekly rates of social insurance and social assistance payments; to provide for a special increase of 6 per cent from next July in all short term rates of payment; to provide for amendment to and rationalisation of certain schemes arising from Government consideration last year of the 1992 Estimates for Social Welfare; to provide for greater standardisation between schemes and improved administration generally; and to provide for certain amendments to the Pensions Act, 1990, in relation to occupational pensions.</P>
    <P>The increase in weekly rates of social welfare payments provided for in this Bill are evidence of the Government's commitment to protect the position of those dependent on social welfare.  That commitment is laid down in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and we are honouring it.</P>
    <P>The 4 per cent general increase will ensure that for the fifth successive year since 1987 increases in social welfare payments will keep ahead of inflation.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are continuing the policy adopted in recent years of giving extra increases to those on the lowest social welfare payments.  From July next, those on weekly short term payments will get an extra 2 per cent on top of the general 4 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>This additional increase is a significant step towards achieving another commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which is to meet by 1993 the priority rates set by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Since last July, all long term rates have either reached or exceeded those priority rates. The additional 2 per cent increase for short term rates provided for in this Bill leaves us well placed to achieve our target next year.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the impact of these increases for different benefit types and family situations: a married man with three children on short term unemployment assistance will have his weekly payment increased from £119 to £124.80, i.e., £5.80 per week; a married man with five children on long term unemployment <Col N="1333" /> assistance will get an increase of £6 per week, from £148 to £154; the personal rate of disability benefit will increase by £3 per week from £50 to £53.  A married man with three children will get an increase of £5.80 per week; a married couple, one under 66, in receipt of old age (non-contributory) pension will receive an increase of £8.50, i.e., from £83 to £91.50.  This is because the increase of pension for a spouse under 66, which currently is 50 per cent of the personal rate, is being increased to the level of the adult dependant allowance for social assistance schemes generally, i.e. £34.30; and a couple getting a retirement pension or old age (contributory) pension will receive an increase of £4.40 per week.</P>
    <P>The increases in weekly rates of payment are provided for in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the extension of the over 80 allowance to invalidity pensions from April 1992.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an increase in the weekly income limits for family income supplement purposes from July 1992.  This means that the limits below which families can qualify for family income supplement will be increased to £215 a week for a four child family and £294 a week for an eight or more child family.  These increases are designed to improve the incentive to work for people at levels of earnings covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>Sections 7, 8 and 9 provide for increases in the ceilings for PRSI contributions and in the weekly earnings disregard for pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 provide for a modification in the contribution conditions for entitlement to retirement and contributory old age pensions through the introduction of an alternative method of satisfying the &ldquo;yearly average&rdquo; test.  At present a yearly average of 48 contributions must be paid or credited from 1953 or from date of entry into insurance, if later than 1953, in order to qualify for a maximum rate pension.  Where the average lies between 20 and 48, reduced rates of pension are payable.</P>
    <P>The establishment and verification of <Col N="1334" /> a person's insurance record over a 40 year period can be difficult in view of changes in the social insurance system over the period.  The PRSI system was introduced in 1979 and since then insured workers have been paying contributions through the income tax system on an earnings related basis.  Insurance records over this period can be readily established.  It is reasonable that where a person has a full record since 1979 they should be able to qualify for a full pension.  The Government have, therefore, proposed that a person should be able to qualify for a maximum rate pension if the average of 48 contributions is satisfied since 6 April 1979.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the new measure is not an extra hurdle but an alternative which some people will find easier to satisfy and which will result in quicker and simpler adjudication of pensions claims.  The appropriate conditions for entitlement to pension is among the issues being addressed by the National Pensions Board.  The question of further amendments to the contribution conditions will be considered when the National Pensions Board publish their final report.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other changes affecting pension schemes in sections 12 to 18 of the Bill, the details of which are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill concerns maternity allowance.  In relation to this let me say, first, that there has been a considerable amount of misunderstanding of this provision in some of the comments which have been made about the Bill.</P>
    <P>Essentially what is being provided for is the amalgamation of the two existing maternity allowance schemes into one scheme.  The new scheme will cover not only women who are covered by the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, Department of Labour legislation, but others who are covered by the social insurance system but not by that Act.</P>
    <P>Since April 1991 employees earning over £25 a week are covered by the social insurance system.  This has brought a <Col N="1335" /> large number of part-time workers, mainly women, within the scope of the system.  They will now be covered for maternity allowance, whether their conditions of employment are such that they come within the scope of the Maternity Protection of Employees Act.  Maternity allowance will be payable for 14 weeks as at present at a standard rate of 70 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings subject to a minimum amount to be prescribed in regulations.  This minimum will take account of the fact that women on low earnings who were not previously covered by social insurance will now be covered.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 to 24 provide for the standardising and streamlining of existing arrangements and powers to pursue liable relatives for the maintenance of their families.  Since 1989 provision has been made for imposing a liability on the spouse of a recipient of deserted wives payments or supplementary welfare allowance to contribute towards such payments.  Recipients of such payments are liable to transfer certain maintenance payments received to the Minister for Social Welfare or to the health board, as appropriate.  The new provisions will also provide for the granting of attachment of earnings orders in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 and 26 of the Bill refer to the deserted wife's benefit scheme.  It was announced at the time of publication of the 1992 Estimates that the Government have decided to apply an earnings limit for entitlement to deserted wife's benefit. I would emphasise that this measure will only apply to new claimants for deserted wife's benefit and the deserted wife's allowance scheme is not affected in any way.</P>
    <P>The deserted wife's benefit scheme is somewhat unusual and unique in a social insurance context.  It is unusual to be able to insure oneself against deserting one's spouse.  The scheme applies to women only and further improvements in regard to equal treatment between men and women will undoubtedly require rationalisation of the present arrangements. Also, there are obvious inconsistencies <Col N="1336" /> between the benefits available under this scheme and those available under the social assistance lone parent's allowance and the deserted wife's allowance scheme, which are both means tested</P>
    <P>Recipients of deserted wife's benefit can have additional income which does not affect their benefit.  The measure now proposed is to restrict entitlement to benefit to persons at or above average earnings of around £12,000 a year.  I envisage a tapered withdrawal of benefit at around this level.  The details will be spelt out in regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is largely a consolidation measure in that it replaces the unemployment assistance chapter of the Social Welfare Acts.  It also contains a number of amendments, most notably the abolition of the requirement to have a qualification certificate before being able to claim unemployment assistance.  The qualification certificate is essentially a statement of a person's means.  The requirement to have a qualification certificate makes the procedure for claiming unemployment assistance somewhat cumbersome and the abolition of the certificate will streamline the application process.</P>
    <P>Section 27 also provides for the linking of claims which are separated by a period during which the claimant is attending a FÁS course, including a course the duration of which exceeds 52 weeks; and the assessment of earnings from insurable employment in determining entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In relation to this last point, under present arrangements, earnings from employment are exempted in determining means for unemployment assistance purposes.  This means that a person can work for a number of days in a week and qualify for unemployment assistance for the remaining days, regardless of the amount of his earnings for the days worked.  On the other hand, a person on unemployment assistance who engages in self-employment has his earnings from self-employment assessed.  I think we have to have a consistent approach on this.  What the amendment will achieve is that broadly the arrangements which <Col N="1337" /> apply where a person takes up employment as an employee will be the same as those which already apply where a person engages in self-employment.</P>
    <P>I take the point which has been made by some commentators about the need to create incentives for unemployed people to take up employment or self-employment. I am very much in favour of providing incentives and encouragement to people to improve their situation and reduce their dependency on the State welfare system.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that this is a broader issue and needs to be tackled in a more comprehensive way.  Attempts have been made over the years through various special schemes to encourage the long term unemployed in this way with very limited success.  For example, the part-time job incentive scheme provides a weekly payment to long term unemployed people who cease claiming unemployment assistance and take up part-time employment.  The take up of the scheme since 1986 has been extremely disappointing.  I will be looking at further ways in which the system can be made more responsive to the needs in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for certain amendments to the unemployment benefit arrangements which arise from the inclusion of part-time workers in the social insurance system from 6 April 1991.  Any employee earning over £25 a week is now covered by the social insurance system and from January 1993 will be entitled to short-time benefits on foot of their contributions after April 1991.</P>
    <P>The unemployment benefit scheme is intended to compensate for unemployment lost.  A person who habitually works on a part-time basis and who suffers unemployment will, under the arrangements I am proposing, be eligible for unemployment benefit at a level related to the employment which he has lost.  A person whose habitual pattern of work over a lengthy period is, say, three days a week and who loses his job should qualify for benefit for those three days and not for days which are not normally working days for him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> The introduction of an additional condition for unemployment benefit where a person must have suffered a substantial loss of employment in order to qualify for benefit, is designed to address this issue.  Clearly there is great variety in the patterns of part-time working and I am taking power in regulations to specify what a substantial loss of employment will involve in particular types of situations.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 31 of the Bill provide for taking account of redundancy payments in determining entitlement to unemployment assistance.  The social insurance fund, which is financed by PRSI contributions and an Exchequer subvention, is there for people who, through no fault of their own, become unemployed and are in need of income support.  That is essentially the purpose of the social insurance system &mdash; to provide for contingencies such as involuntary unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is not uncommon for redundancy packages to be negotiated on the basis of an automatic right to unemployment benefit for 15 months.  As Deputies are aware, severance packages can involve substantial sums of money.  The question is whether the social insurance fund, which is there to provide income support in certain circumstances, should in effect be part of such packages.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in some instances the social insurance fund is being used to top-up redundancy packages whether of a voluntary nature or otherwise.  My Department are aware of situations where severance packages, which did not even qualify as redundancy, were openly advertised within companies on the basis of an automatic right to a weekly top-up payment in the form of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about these trends. The approach provided for in the Bill is, in my view, a reasonable one, namely, that in determining entitlement to income support in post-redundancy or voluntary severance situations, some account should be taken of the amount of redundancy payment received.  It is proposed that in the case of persons <Col N="1339" /> under the age of 55 years who receive a severence payment in excess of a fixed level, a disqualification from the receipt of unemployment benefit will apply for up to a maximum of nine weeks.  The level of severance payment will be specified in regulations.  I am satisfied, however, the the principle underlying this provision is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Also, under present arrangements, people who leave employment voluntarily can also be entitled to unemployment payments but are subject to a disqualification period of up to six weeks. This Bill proposes to extend that period up to nine weeks and, as I have said, to apply it to severance situations in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the proposals provided for in these sections of the Bill are as follows: the period of disqualification from receiving unemployment benefit for up to six weeks in certain circumstances is being extended to nine weeks in order to bring it into line with the disqualification period applicable in the case of disability benefit.  In addition, the claimant's overall entitlement to unemployment benefit is being reduced by the period of the disqualification; as I have already indicated, the circumstances giving rise to a period of disqualification from receiving unemployment benefit is being extended to include the situation where a person receives a payment under the Redundancy Payments Acts or by way of a separate agreement with his employer which is in excess of an amount to be prescribed in regulations, and the new arrangements will not apply in the case of those 55 years of age or over.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 30 is to apply the same conditions to week on/week off working as apply to short-time working within a week.  The effect will be that pay-related benefit will not be payable in the week on/week off situation.</P>
    <P>Short-time working as generally understood usually takes the form of a short working week, i.e. a two or three day working week, on a systematic basis for a certain period of time.  Workers in that situation are entitled to sign on and <Col N="1340" /> receive unemployment benefit for the days of the week on which they are not working.  Entitlement to unemployment benefit is, however, subject to certain restrictions.  Since 1983, the amount of unemployment benefit payable for each day of unemployment is calculated at one-fifth of the weekly rate, instead of one-sixth, and pay-related benefit is not payable.</P>
    <P>In recent years some industries faced with reduced demand have operated a week on/week off or similar pattern of work.  Indeed, there have been instances of firms switching from a short working week to a week on/week off situation. The restrictions on the amount of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit payable in the case of short-time workers do not at present apply to those working week on/week off.  As the two patterns of working are for practical purposes identical, there is an obvious anomaly here which needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 32 of the Bill provides for a change in the contribution conditions for disability benefit.  At present to qualify for disability benefit a person must have a minimum number of paid contributions at any time since entry into insurance &mdash; 39 for short term disability benefit or 260 for long term disability benefit &mdash; and a minimum of 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  It is now proposed that, with certain exceptions to be specified in regulations, at least 13 of the 39 contributions in the governing contribution year will have to be paid rather than credited.</P>
    <P>The basis for this proposal is that the disability benefit scheme is essentially for people who have recently been at work and paying PRSI contributions and who then fall sick.  The requirement to have a minimum number of paid contributions in the governing contribution year is designed to establish a recent attachment to the workforce for people applying for disability benefit.  Under present arrangements, it is possible for a person to qualify for disability benefit on the basis of credited contributions even though he has not been in employment for a very long time, has effectively lost any attachment <Col N="1341" /> to the workforce and perhaps has no intention to seek paid employment.  The revised condition will have the effect of directing the scheme more effectively at those for whom it was intended.</P>
    <P>The section provides that the new condition will not apply to certain circumstances to be specified in regulations. The new condition will apply at the initial stage of qualification for disability benefit. Once a person qualifies and continues to be sick they will remain on disability benefit as they do at present. Similarly, persons on unemployment benefit will have a recent record of paid contributions and will be able to qualify for disability benefit should they fall ill.</P>
    <P>After a certain point, however, it should not be possible to qualify for what is a short term insurance payment on the basis essentially of a record of credited contributions.  The regulations to be made under this section will ensure that any person with a genuine recent record of paid contributions, who is still effectively within the social insurance system, will not be affected by the new condition.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides for the discontinuance of pay-related benefit payable with disability benefit for new claimants from a date to be appointed. Pay-related benefit under present arrangements is paid in addition to flat-rate disability benefit after the third week of illness.  The value of pay-related benefit has been greatly reduced over the recent years.  Furthermore, as announced at the publication of the 1992 Estimates in December last, the Government have decided that responsibility for short term sickness payments should be transferred to employers through a scheme of statutory sick pay.  In order for employers to participate in this type of arrangement, the rates of benefit require to be simplified and streamlined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 35 provides that the personal <Col N="1342" /> rate of injury benefit under the occupational injury benefit scheme, currently £65 a week, will be aligned to the personal rate of disability benefit, that is £50 rising to £53 in July.  This will apply to new claimants only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Injury benefit is paid for the first six months of illness following an accident at work.  The person, if still incapable of work, then goes on to disability benefit.  There is little justification for having a higher rate of short term benefit for incapacity for work simply because the incapacity arises from an accident or occupational disease.  This measure is also part of the overall streamlining of short term sickness payments in the context of statutory sick pay.</P>
      <P>Part IX of the Bill provides for a number of miscellaneous amendments to existing legislation, some of which I will now mention briefly.  Section 36 provides for the extension of carer's allowance to cover persons caring for recipients of retirement pension who are aged between 65 and 66 years and who have transferred from invalidity pension at 65.</P>
      <P>Section 37 provides for the integration of single woman's allowance with pre-retirement allowance.  This scheme was introduced in 1974 to cater for elderly single women who had never been in wage-earning employment and who could not qualify for unemployment assistance under the conditions which then applied.  The need for the separate scheme has effectively disappeared in the light of changes in the conditions for unemployment assistance in the meantime. This section proposed to discontinue the scheme for new claimants after a day to be appointed.  Existing recipients of single woman's allowance will be transferred to pre-retirement allowance at the same rate of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 41 gives power to make regulations delegating certain administrative functions of the Department of Social Welfare to other organisations.  At present certain functions are carried out by other organisations such as the <Col N="1343" /> encashment of pension orders by post offices.  The relationships between my Department and An Post is being placed on a more formal footing in the context of current plans for the development of Post Office services.  While there are no immediate plans to devolve further functions, developments in technology and otherwise will open up considerable possibilities in this area in the future and the provision in section 41 is designed to enable me to take advantage of any such possibilities for the benefit of social welfare clients.</P>
    <P>Section 47 relates to the payment of weekly supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. These supplements are paid under section 209 of the Consolidation Act and the bulk of them are to assist people in meeting rent or mortage costs.  The purpose of this section is to enable payments under this heading to be directed more specifically towards people in need of such assistance and to achieve greater standardisation in the provision of supplementary payments in the different health board areas.</P>
    <P>Part X of the Bill contains a number of amendments to the Pensions Act, 1990, which are proposed following consultation with the Pensions Board and the details of which are outlined in the Explanatory Memorandum.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when one thinks that one and a half hours will be taken out for Private Members' Business. In all my years here in the Dáil I have not seen anything quite like it.  I cannot do anything about it, but I want to put my complaint on the record.</P>
      <P>This Bill sets a very dangerous precedent. The Bill shows no imagination. Without doubt it is anti-work and anti-woman. The new and dangerous trend towards undermining PRSI entitlements is to be deplored.  Of course, there are huge problems besetting the country. The real cancer of unemployment relates very much to social welfare.  The question that must be asked is how long the working population can sustain a social welfare bill of the size we have, and how long can people on the normal rate of social welfare benefit bring up their families on very low incomes.  There is no fun in living on the dole.  Benefit of £136 per week for a man, his wife and four children is deplorable.  I know people who would spent it in an evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that we owe international bankers £27 billion and that we have 280,000 out of work.  There is no point in hiding from those constraints but I would reiterate that it is no fun for anyone living on the dole.  Some people think that <Col N="1345" /> people on the dole are spongers who do not want to work.  There are some, but the vast majority of social welfare recipients would take a job if they got it in the morning.  This Bill, for whatever reason, will ensure that their position will get worse.</P>
    <P>It appears that this Government and the preceding one were at sixes and sevens as to the economic route that should be taken to tackle unemployment. This Bill clearly illustrates the lack of real thought into what should be done.  It is unfortunate that unemployment levels will probably reach 300,000 before this year is out.  This will mean that the social welfare budget for the year is not big enough and we will have to have another supplementary estimate such as that last Christmas, when we had to look for a further £100 million.  I assume that the supplementary estimate will not be on that scale but it will be a huge sum.</P>
    <P>A social welfare Bill gives the Government a unique opportunity to streamline the system.  However, the Government are introducing a new potentially dangerous trend into social welfare legislation by undermining the benefits of the PRSI scheme.  The decision to deny dental benefit to certain categories of workers is strange, to say the least.  There has been an ongoing row between the Department and the dentists for years. According to the Minister last week in the Dáil, new negotiations are taking place and the Minister seemed to believe it was possible that a deal could be made. Could it be that the Minister has traded off one section of the community in those negotiations?  Is there a hidden agenda whereby any such agreement would mean that the Exchequer would benefit from the PRSI from workers' earnings over £25,000 while at the same time such workers would prove to be financially rewarding clients for dental practitioners? A great number of people are very worried about this matter and I should like the Minister to clarify it when replying.</P>
    <P>For the family with only one spouse working, the proposals are even more draconian.  The Bill fails to group family <Col N="1346" /> income.  For instance, both spouses could earn less than £25,000, perhaps £24,000 each, and still be eligible for dental treatment.</P>
    <P>Workers have no option but to become involved in the scheme at great cost to themselves.  For many the withdrawal of entitlements to dental and optical benefits means that a new tax has now been introduced on people who earn more than £25,000.</P>
    <P>Equally, for workers who lose their jobs unemployment benefit is being severely curtailed.  The Minister for Social Welfare now proposes to penalise the new unemployed by denying them nine weeks' unemployment benefit where a certain level of redundancy payment has been made.</P>
    <P>The precedent set in today's Bill is frightening.  All workers who paid PRSI up to now considered their entitlements to be rock solid.  They expected the same treatment to apply to all PRSI contributors. Clearly this Government see the PRSI scheme as a new form of taxation. For example, people who earn over £25,000 will not have any refund of PRSI, despite losing dental benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that last week that only 18,000 persons will be debarred from the dental schemes as a result of the new legislation.  There may be only 18,000 on the present waiting list, however, due to the impasse with the Dental Association over several years, many workers just did not bother to apply as they felt it was futile.  To expect that there are only 18,000 people in Ireland earning over £25,000 in need of dental care is ridiculous and I would ask the Minister to recheck that.</P>
    <P>If there is one major fault or complaint with this Bill, it is that there is no attempt made whatever to eliminate the poverty trap.  The poverty trap means very simply the gradual realisation by a man or woman who is working full time in a very low income job that he or she would be better off on the dole.  Unfortunately, there is a certain section of our community who think that way and when the sums are calculated they are probably right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> This is extremely bad for a nation.  It proves conclusively that there is no real scientific work being done by anybody at this level.  The CIF carried out a project on this some years ago and they proved that a point was reached for many workers in low paid jobs where they would be better off on the dole.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that this was an ideal opportunity for the Government to introduce an imaginative family income supplement scheme.  This was, and should be, a vehicle by which the work that was being done by the individual was deemed to be important enough to place its cost above that of social welfare.  I want to make it clear, of course, that there is no fun in being in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Only two weeks ago in the Dáil the Minister for Social Welfare informed me that it now costs almost £23 a week to rear a child from one to five years and £32 a week to rear a child between five and 14 years.  After that, need I say more.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning that this Bill is badly planned.  If one looks at some of the aspects of the Bill it is clear that there was no overall strategy used when framing this Bill.  Indeed, there are glaring omissions from the Bill, one of which the Minister mentioned.  I do not see any reference to the £22 million that was allocated in the budget to women under the EC Directive on equality in matters of social welfare between men and women.</P>
    <P>This is a scandal that has gone on too long.  There are thousands of women around the country who do not know whether they are eligible.  Thousands of women have tried to get answers from the Department.  To whom will they apply?  Is there a standard form for application? Do they have to prove their case legally? Do they have to get a solicitor to have the case noted in court?  Who are to get the £22 million?  How will this be distributed? Is it for a certain category of people or does it mean that the one woman might get four different payments over as many years for four different <Col N="1348" /> types of social welfare?  There are no answers to a whole range of questions.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Government not to keep people, women in particular, in the dark about their entitlements and it is something that has been put under the carpet.  Indeed, were it not for the fantastic efforts of FLAC, the free legal aid people, it is quite possible that we would not have arrived at the position we are at today.</P>
    <P>There is another glaring omission in this Bill.  It refers to the desirability of having a single means test for all social welfare benefits.  There is in this country a very profitable industry for assessing people.  We are probably the best nation in the world for assessing others.  With no disrespect to the people concerned &mdash; it is their job and they do it professionally &mdash; I genuinely believe that their masters in the Department of Social Welfare should be well able to design a scheme that would certainly cut out a lot of the red tape.</P>
    <P>There is no particular reason a code of practice could not be devised which would encompass eligibility for the major social welfare schemes like unemployment assistance, non-contributory old age pensions, application for medical cards, and so on.</P>
    <P>From Dáil questions which I tabled to the Minister in recent times, it appears that the Minister thinks that it is not feasible to have a single means test. Surely if we were to have any sort of rationale in the maze that is now social welfare we should start there.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the whole question of the poverty trap, could I say that it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility that the Department of Social Welfare could organise a gradual eligibility so that if a person was just marginally over a particular guideline he or she would not be deemed to be ineligible entirely.  If we had that gradual approach we would not have this huge problem of people deciding automatically that they would be better off on the dole than working.</P>
    <P>Taken together with a beefed up family income supplement, we would beat that trap and that is vitally important.  I fully <Col N="1349" /> understand that it is not possible to wipe it out altogether, but duplication must be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I turn my attention to another anti-woman section of this Bill.  For whatever reason, women have been singled out for special treatment in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I notice there is almost no change in the carer's allowance.  What a tragedy this is when one considers the heroic deeds that are being done by countless thousands of people, particularly women, day in day out, week in week out, all round the clock and for nothing.</P>
    <P>If the elderly had to be looked after in a State run geriatric home, it would cost £300 per week.  Many women I speak to do not want money.  They want a small recognition of this 24-hour a day job.  I ask the Minister, even at this stage, to consider introducing a respite scheme whereby women who are under severe stress in the home because of their responsibilities and duties towards the elderly would be allowed a break of a couple of weeks a year and, perhaps, occasional weekends.  This could be done, for example by taking on unemployed women who would be only too glad to make a few pounds to help the family budget.  This scheme could be tightly controlled, applying only to difficult cases.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea to the Minister to consider the £2 means eligibility limit on the carer's allowance because it is an absolute disgrace.  As I said on a number of occasions with regard to the carer's allowance the people were deceived and their hopes were raised by the way the scheme was advertised.  In 1991 many people decided that the allowance was not worth applying for.  It is my understanding that approximately 9,000 people applied, half of whom were deemed ineligible and 50 per cent of the remainder received the full benefit.  In other words, about 2,000 carers out of 80,000 to 100,000 received the full payment. Obviously there is something wrong with that scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government understand the huge problems experienced in many Irish homes.  Usually it is a daughter or daughter-in-law <Col N="1350" /> who has to care for elderly relatives.  I am not advocating that the State take full responsibility for looking after the elderly.  The prime responsibility rests with the family, and that has been the tradition in family life.  Young people must always remember the extraordinary sacrifices made by parents on their behalf and it is their Christian duty to repay in a caring and responsible way. However, the State has a role to play in this regard.  First, people can be cared for in their homes &mdash; this is where the carer's allowance applies.  Second, there is private residential geriatric care. However, many people cannot afford such care.  There is a lesson to be learned here, that anybody who has the opportunity to do so now should make provision for their retirement because I doubt if the State will do so.  Third, people are cared for in public geriatric homes.  However, it is not possible to gain entry to most such homes.  Recently I telephoned a geriatric home in my constituency but was told that the person for whom I was making representations could not expect to gain entry for at least nine months.  The lady in question is on a medical card and her family are on the dole.  It is very difficult to know where the lady can turn for help.  I believe that home care is the best care for the elderly. A community nursing care programme should be considered under which respite care would be provided, and there would be no problem getting people to help out in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to moneylending. I congratulate the Minister on making available an extra £260,000 to combat the problem of moneylending. While I do not carry a candle for the credit union movement &mdash; I am a member of the credit union in Mount Bellew in Galway &mdash; the more I see of their operations the more I believe that there is a possibility that they could play a role in this area.  I am talking about the credit union movement throughout Ireland and not just in the four or five cities designated for pilot projects.  By working in conjunction with the St. Vincent de Paul Society the credit union could discourage <Col N="1351" /> people from borrowing from moneylenders. Despite what some people think, moneylending is not confined to the big cities.  I am speaking about legal moneylenders who lend money at rates of 47 to 48 per cent.  Many people cannot afford to borrow money at these rates.  I suggest to the Minister and his officials that they consider what role the credit unions could play in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a trend throughout this Bill that I had not noticed in recent years and one about which I am concerned.  The Minister seems to be seeking power but he is not in a position to tell us exactly what is involved.  All he says is that he will introduce ministerial regulations later.  We should not be asked to buy a pig in a poke.  It is only reasonable that the Minister should outline the areas in which he intends to introduce ministerial regulations.  We should have an opportunity of discussing this matter before it becomes law.</P>
    <P>I refer specifically to what I would call a great penalty on redundant workers. Redundant workers who are paid a certain level of redundancy will be penalised to the tune of nine weeks unemployment benefit, and that is unacceptable.  When people lose their jobs they suffer great trauma.  It is a very anxious time for them, and the Department should not decide that they are not entitled to what they genuinely believe is theirs.  As people are obliged to pay PRSI they should be paid unemployment benefit for at least 15 months after they are made redundant. Second, the whole question of voluntary redundancy will come into question.  If this nine week penalty is imposed fewer people will take voluntary redundancy. This is an insensitive measure which will create many problems.  The Department have decided to penalise people who receive a certain level of redundancy by deducting nine weeks payment from their unemployment benefit.  This is a negative measure and the decision should be reversed.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the cost of rearing children.  To my knowledge the only social welfare payment that has not been <Col N="1352" /> increased is child benefit, or the children's allowance as it was called.  I find it extraordinary difficult to understand why this allowance has not been increased. Every report I read from NESC, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and so on, and every conference indicates that the best targeted money ever paid out in social welfare went via the children's allowance, the child benefit scheme, as it was called.  There is a variety of reasons for considering the money to be well targeted. The allowance is paid to the mother and is used to provide children's clothing, footwear, food, school books and so on.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Minister decided to rebuff the mothers of Ireland.  Is this an anti-women measure?  Irish mothers are very sore about the provision relating to the child benefit scheme.  At the very least, they should get the same treatment as everybody else, and this measure calls our priorities into question.</P>
    <P>Although no provision in this regard is contained in the Bill, I want to take this opportunity &mdash; because I have not been afforded one before &mdash; to tell the Minister about a problem for the self-employed concerning PRSI.  The Minister will know that in 1988 self-employed people had to pay PRSI like everyone else.  It was then decided that those with a continuous contribution record for ten years prior to their reaching the age of 65 or 66 would be eligible for an old age contributory pension.  That was good legislation, and the Government went a step further, on which I congratulated them at the time by providing that widows whose spouses had made contributions for three years would be eligible for a contributory widows pension.  A few problems have arisen with that scheme, although I do acknowledge that they could not have been foreseen.  I know four of these widows involved &mdash; there are about 21, or possibly more, of them around the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not have time now to deal with the issue in the way I should like to.  All that I shall say is that the issue is creating unholy havoc for those concerned, that the amount of money involved is not such that the Government would be opening the sluice gates.  I understand the contributions were paid but there was a time lag of three or four months.  There should be some kind of <i>pro rata</i> pension for those who are caught just because they were born in the wrong year.  Having paid six, seven or eight years' pension contributions, they should be paid part of a pension.  Those involved are self-employed people, mostly farmers.</P>
      <P>My party will oppose many sections of this legislation, which I regard as a backward step.  I am dumbfounded by some of its provisions, and I certainly hope to deal with them tomorrow on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the new Minister on his appointment.  I look forward to working with him, in a constructive way.  I know from the many contributions he made in the past when I was Social Welfare spokesman that he and I share common ground in relation to social welfare and social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>To some degree, I am left with a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister because I know that he has inherited the Bill.  Reading the contribution of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Daly, of Thursday, 19 December 1991, one realises that virtually everything contained in that speech is included in the Bill in one form or another.  I assume that the present Minister has not had time to influence the Bill in the way that he would personally have liked to do.  I do hope that some of the thinking enunciated by the Minister from the back benches in years gone by might lead to constructive changes in several sections of this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Connaughton's view that it is difficult to deal with such a technical Bill, and many explanations will <Col N="1354" /> be required, particularly on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes major changes in the whole social welfare code.  Many of the proposals made in the Bill are good and are proposals that Opposition members collectively have advocated for many years.  In many respects the Bill will tidy up loose ends and anomalies that have emerged from the system through the years.  However, certainly in my 30 years of dealing with social welfare issues at every level, I have never heard so much criticism of a Bill as I have heard directed at this Bill.  The Minister accepted that there were many anomalies that needed to be tidied up, and I agree with that statement.  The Minister has to realise, though, that when a loophole is closed off or an anomaly is tidied up very often innocent people are caught in the process. That is what will happen if these provisions are accepted.  The issues of concern will emerge clearly when we reach the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I certainly favour rationalising and simplifying the social welfare code.  Frankly, there are very few people in the country who understand even a proportion of social welfare activities.  Social welfare requires an enormous amount of administration and there is much wastage in administration costs and in the cost of implementing the system itself, both nationally and locally.  Because there are now more than one million people involved in social welfare at one level or another, it is obviously time for us to tidy up the whole social welfare system.  I am glad that a new Bill is being prepared with a view to achieving that end.  We should work collectively towards making an input into that Bill, which, it is to be hoped, will achieve its aim.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree with me that it is most unusual for criticism of the Bill to have come from the ICTU, from the largest trade union in the country, SIPTU, and from the CII. If the ICTU criticised a measure, then normally one would expect the CII and the FIE to welcome it.  I have never known virtually all sections of the community, including all voluntary agencies, <Col N="1355" /> to be so strong in criticism of a Bill.  The Minister should take the criticism into account and make effective amendments on Committee Stage, amendments that will at least draw the fire away from some of the draconian measures contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As someone who came from a labour-intensive industry, I am concerned about the effect that some of the Bill's provisions will have on some industries. From the Minister's own experience, he will know full well, as will everyone in the House who has dealt with industry, that because of the seasonal nature of their activities, many industries must organise themselves in the best manner possible for short term working, if you like, to cater for the hills and hollows they encounter, when there will be a shortage of work in one period and larger quantities at other times of the year.  For example, the clothing industry, which employ 15,000, must so organise their work because of its seasonal nature.  They must endeavour to retain their skilled workers, machinists, cutters and so on, while sharing out the work in such a manner that will allow them retain their skilled workers on whom they will have spent much time and money training.</P>
    <P>Let us call a spade a spade; they do so with the help of the Department of Social Welfare.  Obviously it is better to have 15,000 people working than have to lay them off in slack periods between the autumn and spring seasons.  Otherwise they would have to declare such workers redundant, placing them permanently on unemployment benefit, when they might well emigrate, with a loss of their skills, necessitating training other workers when the climate improved.  That is a very costly exercise.  We should remember that, in the interim, those people would have to be paid all the other ancillary benefits for which they would not be eligible while drawing temporary unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the provisions of this Bill and its effects on people on short term working, will have to be carefully scrutinised if the trade unions are forced to <Col N="1356" /> negotiate redundancies using the traditional approach, last in, first out.  Over the years policies leading to such negotiations <i>vis-à-vis</i> voluntary redundancies have changed.  I heard the Minister make this point in the House but I might remind him that the policy of voluntary redundancies arose mainly within the public service, initiated by a previous Government, in order to reduce the numbers of employees within the public service, when 16,000 workers opted for voluntary redundancy, all of them being paid the benefits to which they were entitled under the severance package negotiated between Government and public service unions.  Indeed, that policy percolated throughout the public sector to health boards, harbour boards, corporations, county councils and all public authorities. All the people who opted for that package, including senior employees in Government Departments, in the State and semi-State sectors, were in the upper age bracket, encouraged and paid for by taxpayers in order to reduce the numbers employed in the public service.  That was and remains Government policy, the public service embargo still being applicable to the public service itself.  For example, local authorities cannot employ people to replace those who may have opted for early retirement.  That is Government policy.  Yet, in the provisions of this Bill, we propose doing the exact opposite, in that we will render it almost impossible for employers and trade unions to negotiate voluntary redundancy packages if both social welfare benefits and redundancy benefits are to be taxed, catching people on both counts.</P>
    <P>It was never intended that voluntary redundancy schemes would be reluctantly accepted by the trade union movement only to be followed by taxation of the same benefits of such workers.  I contend the provisions of this Bill will force trade unions to return to the former policy of last in, first out because they will have no alternative.  I should like to hear the Minister's explanation in that regard.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with that subject over a <Col N="1357" /> 30 year period, since I was 18 years of age, I know that, unless people are given an incentive to opt for early retirement or voluntary redundancy, they will not go; they will simply wait until they reach the normal retirement age of 65.  The inevitable consequence will be that younger people &mdash; the people we want to retain in employment, young married people with mortgage repayments, heavily in debt, with families, with many commitments, including hire purchase payments &mdash; will be forced on to the unemployment scrapheap if some of the provisions of this Bill are passed.</P>
    <P>I cannot overstress the importance of short term working, to which the Minister referred in his introductory remarks.  It is true to say that this can be manipulated, because it is done only to keep people at work and to share out available work as evenly and fairly as possible, but if such circumstances do not prevail, employers will be forced to lay off workers permanently which will cost the Department and taxpayers a lot more.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill, the PRSI system will be virtually abolished, which is the only way I can describe it. The system was originally devised to assist people who were out of work due to illness or who were unemployed temporarily, and they had to pay a fairly high premium for this assistance.  For example, average benefit payments in the year 1981-82 amounted to 30 per cent of wages, subsequently reduced to 20 per cent and, yet again, to 12 per cent.  Since 1981 three successive Governments were involved in that reduction, but the fact remains that these benefit payments have been reduced to 12 per cent.  During that period, the eligibility for such PRSI benefit was pulled back to five weeks, which means a worker receives no PRSI benefit whatsoever until the fifth week.  The floor for eligibility purposes has been increased over 50 per cent since 1981 while the ceiling has been dropped, which means effectively greater numbers of workers do not qualify for PRSI benefit, even discounting the provisions of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Last week I had at least four or five <Col N="1358" /> people attend my constituency office who could not understand why they received no PRSI payment whatsoever, yet contributions had been deducted from their weekly wages.  They discovered, when out of work, they can reap no benefit from those weekly deductions whatsoever. The only way to describe that is to say it is like insuring one's car against accident, but, when one is involved in an accident the insurance company say the car is insured but they cannot compensate for the damage incurred.  We are actually charging workers, whether engaged in services or industry, and the self-employed, a tax, an insurance cover contribution, yet when they need benefit, when they have an accident at work, become ill or are unemployed, we tell them they cannot receive such benefit. That is what has happened.</P>
    <P>I am not for one moment suggesting the present Minister is responsible for all that; that has occurred since 1981, but if the provisions of this Bill are superimposed on that, then it would be better &mdash; and I have said so in the House before &mdash; that the PRSI system of contribution was totally abolished.  Were we honest about it, that is what we would do rather than tamper with it as we are now doing. Rather we should increase the basic rates of social welfare benefits on the lines recommended to Government by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Before the conclusion of this debate, it would be interesting if the Minister could produce statistics on how many people were entitled to draw social welfare/PRSI payments in 1981 and how many would be entitled to draw those same payments now is similar circumstances. I predict we would discover a substantial drop in the numbers who would qualify.  I do not see how it can be legally and constitutionally possible to deduct money from a person's weekly pay package, whether he or she be a professional, industrial worker or employed in the public service, and then, when they are entitled to benefit say sorry, we cannot give it to you.  I do not think that could be justified in any country.  If people make a contribution <Col N="1359" /> to the system, they should get some assistance from it when that need arises. The ordinary man in the street cannot understand this decision by the Government.</P>
    <P>As I said, I welcome many of the provisions in the Bill.  I will deal with these in greater detail on Committee Stage tomorrow but I am asking the Minister to concentrate on two specific points.  I ask him not to tax social welfare benefits. Should he proceed to do so, he will go down in history as the person who started the demolition of our social welfare system.  The proposed taxation of social welfare benefits is a little like the abolition of car tax in 1977 and its replacement by a £5 disc.  We were told at that time there would be no tax on cars. However, I pay £250 in car tax at present. Next year a different Minister may be in office &mdash; one of the parties on this side of the House may be in Government &mdash; but the same people will be in the Department. They are the people who will have to put into operation the legislation passed by this House.  In ten or 15 years time people will remember Minister McCreevy as the person who introduced the Bill in the Dáil which taxed social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>This is the first time in the history of the State that such a proposal has been put forward.  I would hate Minister McCreevy to be labelled as the person who introduced taxation of social welfare benefits.  He is a Minister with very liberal views on our social welfare system.  As a backbencher he made contributions on various budgets and Social Welfare legislation that were similar in content to my own contributions on those issues.  The Labour Party will be opposing the section containing that proposal as we will be opposing a number of other sections. However, Opposition parties can put down amendments to the various sections but as the House knows, the Chair will have to politely tell us that because this is a financial Bill the only amendments which will not be ruled out of order are those which would not have financial consequences.  Therefore, any amendments <Col N="1360" /> which will have a financial consequence will have to be put down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the three provisions I have concentrated on, will have to oppose virtually every section of the Bill. Even if a number of sections were taken out we could not vote for the Bill in total because this taxation proposal will eventually have an effect on all the other provisions in the Bill.  The Labour Party will strongly oppose this Social Welfare Bill, 1992, at its various Stages this week. As has been made clear already on the Order of Business, the Labour Party consider it disgraceful that this Bill is being guillotined.  It is far too important to be dealt with it in this way.  I ask the Minister to use his influence to ensure that more time is devoted to the remaining Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>During a week when tentative steps have been taken to agree the terms of reference for a jobs forum it is disgraceful that the Government should launch this thinly disguised attack on the rights of working class people who have to depend on social welfare benefits.  This is the first time in the history of the State that a Government have proposed to treat social welfare benefits for tax purposes, benefits which have been paid for week in and week out by the PRSI contributions of people at work.  Many people will regard this decision of the Government as the beginning of the end of the PRSI system.  In fact, it will be the end of the PRSI system as it was framed and introduced.  That system was based on the principle that people at work would pay insurance so that when they were ill or unemployed there would be a source of support for them.  How much longer will this be the case?  That is a very important question.  This is the first step in the removal of that insurance.  As I said, it would be much more honest for this House to put through a Bill which would abolish the PRSI system altogether and increase the basic rates of social welfare.  This would save the country and the Department of Social Welfare millions of pounds in administrative costs.  Millions of pounds will have to be <Col N="1361" /> spent in administering a system which will not be of any benefit to a substantial proportion of the people who are actually paying for it.  Therefore, this is a double taxation.  Workers who pay their PRSI contributions will not get their PRSI back for the first five weeks they are out sick or are unemployed or working short term.  On top of that they are now to be taxed.  I do not understand how anyone could justify that proposal.  I appeal very strongly to the Minister to reconsider those aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party condemn this decision by the Government.  This Bill is a savage attack on the principles enunciated by the Minister.  It will ensure that increasingly fewer people will be entitled to reducing benefits.  I fully appreciate that over one million people are on social welfare benefits of one kind or another. However, these people did not ask to be on social welfare.  The reason they are on social welfare is that successive Governments have failed to provide employment for them.  If the Government fail to create employment for people, then they must provide some source of income for them which will enable them and their families to have a reasonable standard of living. So far, we have collectively failed to do this.  Even the recommendations set out by the Commission on Social Welfare in their report have still not been implemented and are not likely to be implemented.  Indeed we seem to be moving further away from these recommendations.</P>
    <P>If we could say that over a period, in a planned way, we would introduce as many of the recommendations of the Commission as possible, there would be some hope of achieving a reasonable standard of living for people on social welfare, so that they could at least keep their families with some dignity.</P>
    <P>I have seen headlines in the newspapers this week in regard to giving people on social welfare tinned bully beef which we cannot sell or give away.  It reminds me of what happened in the trenches during the 1914-1918 War.  We are paying millions of pounds for the intervention system to keep food in cold <Col N="1362" /> storage; we are paying more to keep food in cold storage than it costs to produce it.  This money comes from people all over Europe who pay tax and yet we hand those on social welfare tinned meat worth £15.  It is degrading, to say the least.  By all means give it to those who need it but it would be much better to give them the money it cost to produce so that they could shop like anybody else and not have to go, cap in hand, to a voluntary organisation for a tin of meat. If people on social welfare had a decent level of income we would not have to give them tins of beef.</P>
    <P>I also read in a newspaper where some people on social welfare never eat fresh meat.  What kind of a State is it that will go after social welfare recipients, with all the resources at its command, and turn a blind eye to abuses ripping off the economy to the tune of millions of pounds every year?  Many people have defrauded the system and offshore companies have unloaded money by the truckload while people on social welfare are being hounded because they have received an over-payment or have cleaned windows to try to supplement their allowances.  People on social welfare should be allowed to take little part-time jobs to supplement their incomes.  We should sell the tinned meat to the Russians or the underprivileged of the Third World or, indeed, give it to them. However, we should look after our own people in a much more humane way.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to be influenced by the Department.  On another occasion I told a Minister in another Government that a mistake had been made; four years later I was proved right. I should hate to have to stand up in this House in two, three or four years' time to remind the Minister that I made a special appeal to him this evening on behalf of the working class people &mdash; and on behalf of those who are not working &mdash; not to introduce a tax on social welfare benefits because, if he does, he will regret it until the day he dies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his recent appointment and I wish him <Col N="1363" /> well in trying to resolve the many complex and difficult problems which go with the portfolio in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>This extensive legislation is a continuation of the excellent work and many reforms which were carried out by the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Woods. There are 63 sections in the Bill and it would be impossible in the time available to comment on each one.  However, I am sure all Members will welcome the increases provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Social welfare payments have continued to rise steadily despite the financial difficulties of the Government. An increase of 4 per cent in the weekly personal, adult and child dependant rates for social assistance payments is welcome. A special increase of 6 per cent in short term payments, including disability and unemployment benefits, short term unemployment assistance and the carer's allowance are also welcome.  These additional payments will bring the total expenditure of the Department of Social Welfare to in excess of £3.2 billion this year.  This is an astronomical sum of money for any Government to find each year.</P>
      <P>At present 7 per cent of the population are covered or receive some form of social welfare payment.  The extension of the over 80 allowance of £4.20 per week to invalidity pensioners and the financial improvements in the family income supplement are also very welcome.  Improvements in the method of determining yearly average contribution weeks for contributory old age pensions and retirement pensions is along awaited improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The automatic extension of the contributory widow's pension to widows on the death of their husbands, will be a welcome relief for many people who will be widowed here.  The provision where elderly people will be exempt from the assessment of means from the proceeds on the sale of the principal residence will go a long way in allowing the elderly different options when they become very old or infirm in that they can now choose <Col N="1364" /> to live with relatives or go into private nursing care without the fear of losing their pension.  This will also go a long way in furthering the aims of the Government in relation to the care of the elderly generally.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years all the economic indicators told us that our economy was thriving.  However, unemployment continued to rise and to date almost 300,000 people are out of work.</P>
    <P>Many part-time jobs, <i>ad hoc</i>, temporary positions have come on stream from employers unable to take on full-time workers, and a substantial amount of these full-time jobs are taken up by social welfare recipients.  I welcome any action taken by the Minister to eliminate abuse in the social welfare system.  Those involved in this practice should remember that they are depriving the genuine social welfare recipient of an adequate income.  Those people should also remember the injustice done to themselves and their families because at the end of their working career they and their families will be deprived of contributory retirement and old age pensions.</P>
    <P>We have some cowboy employers who are into the &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; syndrome who fly by night, at the expense of an unfortunate worker left without adequate insurance protection.</P>
    <P>I further believe that many who are legitimately employed are colluding with their employers so that basic pay is substantially reduced in order to avoid income tax payments, and pay-related social insurance payments.  Transfers of money occur on a regular basis under the counter by way of expenses in lieu of salary.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a proper balance between the efficient delivery of social welfare services, which has due regard to the dignity and sense of entitlement of claimants, and the necessity for measures to control fraud.  I recognise that the opportunity for fraud exists in any system, whether it be social welfare, grants to industry, agriculture or taxation, and that control measures are necessary especially where public funds are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> The occurrence of fraud in social welfare has to be considered in the context of almost a million payments per week being made covering 70 per cent of the total population.  In recognising that control measures are necessary, we must also be concerned that the overwhelming majority of claimants are genuine and we should not stigmatise them with a regime which would infringe on their dignity or sense of entitlement.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that social welfare fraud in this country is very serious.  Senior officials will privately admit that it is now as high as 20 per cent which is costing the State millions of pounds each year.  It is an area of his Department where the Minister will have to find the resources for additional staff in the investigation units around the country.</P>
    <P>The changes in the arrangements at employment offices, where unemployed people do not have to sign every week, should free substantial numbers of staff, and I urge the Minister and his officials to retrain the staff in order to give social welfare abuse and fraud the attention they deserve.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill amends the definition of a spouse for the purposes of old age non-contributory and blind pension schemes to include a couple who are co-habitating as man and wife.  As a consequence, cohabitating couples would be entitled to increases for partners on the same basis as married pensioners living with his/her spouses, and to the same rate of child dependant increases as a married couple.</P>
    <P>However, the definition has caused field officers certain difficulties which I would like the Minister to address.  The new definition of a spouse means each person of a married couple who is living together or a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabitating as a man and wife.  It can be very difficult in certain circumstances for officials to determine who is or who is not cohabitating.  In order to obtain two maximum personal rates of payment for any scheme, couples living together will frequently deny that this is in fact the <Col N="1366" /> case and will ask investigating officers or indeed deciding officers to prove that they are cohabitating.  In this respect from inquiries that I have made it would appear that the Department or indeed the Minister have not issued any guidelines to staff who are involved in investigating or deciding on such claims.</P>
    <P>Similar difficulties arose almost 20 years ago in Britain over the same issue and as a result a commission was set up which reported that staff had to establish a number of areas before they could conclude that a couple were cohabitating. Among these were: first, a common household had to be established; second, the stability of the relationship had to exist; third, they would have to show financial support; fourth, a sexual relationship; fifth, the existence of children; and sixth, there was public acknowledgement that a relationship existed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give this area priority in issuing our own guidelines to investigating and deciding officers so that these officials have proper well documented guidelines to go by before making decisions in relation to cohabitation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an additional £17 per week to be gained if a couple can show that they are not in fact cohabitating and that is a big financial incentive to make life very difficult for investigating officers to produce satisfactory evidence.</P>
      <P>A controversy that arose from the Opposition benches when this Bill was published last week has me puzzled.  In 1986 when my colleagues on the Opposition benches were in Government, the report of the Commission on Social Welfare was published.  At that time, the then Minister for Social Welfare, Mrs. Gemma Hussey, wanted time to study the report closely.  By 1987 the Government had changed and her colleagues in Fine Gael and Labour were demanding that the report be implemented in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That report highlighted, among many <Col N="1367" /> other things, that there was a growing concern over the fact that certain social welfare payments were exempt from income tax and that they should be liable for income tax.  They argued that all income, irrespective of where it came from, which exceeded the tax threshold should be liable for income tax.  The Commission on Taxation stated:</P>
    <P>We believe that the exemption of short term social welfare benefit from income tax is contrary to equity principles, which dictate that the amount of income rather than its source should determine the amount of tax which is payable.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in order to eliminate anomalies and other abuses, came forward with proposals to implement the commission's recommendations and the Opposition Deputies cried foul.</P>
    <P>Every week in this country 50,000 people submit regular weekly medical certificates of unfitness to work, 31,000 of these people have spouses who have additional incomes from social welfare, employment or other sources.</P>
    <P>Many of these people have become past-masters at getting sick between January and March in order to ensure their P.60 shows the smallest amount of earned income possible, in order to qualify for medical cards and other grants.  They will also get the maximum tax rebates possible coming to the end of the financial year and, in some cases, they have the audacity to claim for mortgage or rent assistance through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I welcome the decision to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare and the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>The provision of section 32 of this Bill will ensure that new claimants will have at least 13 paid contributions in the governing contribution year, and this will ensure that disability benefit returns to what it was intended to be, short term insurance payment for people who are temporarily out of work through illness, and not a continuous payment to people <Col N="1368" /> who have not been in the workforce for many years which is at present the case.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit and invalidity pension amounted to almost £300 million per year.  This is equal to almost the total amount which is contributed by every employee in the country and, as I said earlier, I am gravely concerned about the funding arrangements for such large expenditure.</P>
    <P>Section 47 replaces the existing provision for payment of weekly and monthly supplements for rent and diet, etc., under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  It empowers the Minister to make regulations specifying the class or classes of persons, the conditions and circumstances in which supplements are to be paid, and the amount of such supplements. These provisions are to be very welcomed indeed.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme has always been regarded by me as the ideal vehicle for targeting the most needy and for providing assistance to the most vulnerable in our society.  However, there appears to be a wide divergence in the interpretation of discretionary powers of health boards to make payments. I would ask the Minister to address this very important point.</P>
    <P>Section 47 of the Bill deals with section 209 of the 1981 Act.  Unfortunately, individual officers will have different views and different ideas as to what constitutes the necessity for a supplement, whether it be for rent, mortgage, diet, heat or any other reason.  Because of these huge discretionary powers and the various interpretations that different health boards have put on them, the public often felt they were not getting a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Various divergences have occurred over the years in different health boards, and also within the same health board. For example, some officers give assistance with mortgage repayments or arrears while others would never approve of assistance in similar circumstances. There is a need for uniformity and I would ask the Minister and his officials to address it.</P>
    <P>I fully accept it is the Minister's intention to bring forward regulations which <Col N="1369" /> would eliminate some of the criticism often made about this scheme.  I hope, as a result, of this Bill being enacted, people in similar circumstances will be dealt with in like manner throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>Because of the prolonged and serious unemployment situation, the reduction in local authority housing and the return of emigrants, rent and mortgage supplements are now a common feature of the social welfare system.  The substantial increase in the number of recipients over the past 12 months has put additional pressures on the small number of community welfare officers employed by the regional health boards.</P>
    <P>The additional high level of case work was never envisaged and the necessary staff to deal adequately with this additional work load has not been provided for.  There is a need to increase substantially the number of community welfare officers employed by the regional health boards or, alternatively, for the Department of Social Welfare to take over the payment of these allowances and reduce some of the intolerable workloads that some community welfare officers have to deal with.  We are all witnessing this problem in our health boards.</P>
    <P>For the fifth consecutive year, I have come into this House on the Second Stage of various social welfare Bills and on each occasion I have made a contribution concerning means testing.  I said earlier that there should be a proper balance between the efficient delivery of social welfare services and due regard for the dignity and sense of entitlement of claimants.</P>
    <P>I believe the time has come for one means testing office to be established that would give people the opportunity to explain clearly and concisely their circumstances, declaring all income and assets and in return being given the maximum amount of information and a certificate to entitlement to all the services that he or she would be entitled to receive.  It should be in the form of an identity passport that when produced in other offices, whether health boards or Government Departments, the people <Col N="1370" /> concerned will know they have been assessed and approved for various services.</P>
    <P>The most frequent complaint received is that in order to obtain unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance by way of an interim payment, medical card or some other service, people are forced to go through several means tests which at times, to say the least, can be a humbling experience.  I have expressed this view in this House on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Department in conjunction with the other Departments involved &mdash; such as Education, the Environment and Agriculture and Food &mdash; to come together to resolve this issue.  If implemented, it would be one of the single greatest improvements ever in the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>It is humiliating when a person goes to the labour exchange and is means tested for unemployment assistance &mdash; when walking through the door he knows he is entitled to a medical card &mdash; that he must then go to the community welfare officer and sit another means test.  The same applies in respect of education and housing assistance.  I ask the Minister, who is new to the Department of Social Welfare, to have a fresh look at that aspect of the service.  It is humiliating for a person who has just signed off with the labour exchange to be told he has to go to the community welfare officer and have another means test.  The same applies for supplementary assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Why cannot we have one means test?  Let us look at the economics of this.  How many officials are involved in the labour exchange the community welfare office and so on.  The same procedure is applied to people who seek grants for third level education.  It would be beneficial if one could produce a certificate to show one had been assessed on a certain date at a certain time rather than being questioned so throughly.  Officials may have to contact each other to see whether the applicant is telling the truth. <Col N="1371" /> This experience of means testing is humiliating.  Recently I saw a widow who understood she was entitled to a non-contributory pension being means tested. I told her that because of her income level she was entitled to a medical card, but she still had to go through the same examination.  I plead with the Minister to introduce one means test which would cover every service for which that person may apply.  I make this request with all sincerity.</P>
      <P>Full-time employment is a formidable political challenge which runs against the grain of current economic performance. Part of our problem is simply that ongoing technological change is likely to reduce further the total demand for labour with the result of even more unemployment.  What is happening is that the structure of employment is changing and the demand for full employment is in fact a demand to promote the kind of policies that are necessary to ensure economic justice and equality for the unemployed.</P>
      <P>The world of work is changing and will continue to change.  We will have to narrow the gap between full-time work and part-time work.  Conditions of part-time work will have to be further improved and pay levels and social welfare benefits will have to be upgraded.</P>
      <P>By narrowing the gap individuals will then have more freedom to move back and forth between part-time employment and full-time employment without sacrificing access to well paid work.  It would then be possible for individuals to alter their work commitments to fit with with different life core situations, such as the need for more education, retraining, more time for child rearing and a preference for a less rigourous work schedule as we get older.</P>
      <P>Together these measures would contribute to a more equitable distribution of work opportunities.  There are no easy solutions and I am certain the Department of Social Welfare will play their part in the changes that I envisage in the years ahead.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out the last day that these proposals were substantially the same as those presented in April 1990.  The promoters of the Bill might well say that the proposals were good in 1990 and there is no harm in repeating them now but I suggested that the proposals had been overtaken by events. Specifically, I mentioned the Pensions Act, 1990, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 and the Worker Participation (Regular Part-time Employees) Act, 1991.  All these, in particular the latter, had an important impact on equality status.</P>
      <P>I mentioned a further perhaps more significant event, the establishment of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  I suggested that the Second Commission had already made a significant impact in the discharge of their responsibilities by publishing in April of last year their first interim report.  That is a fine document and worthy of commendation. I also suggested that as the Second Commission's final report is due in July next it seemed that the Labour Party might just be trying to steal a little of the Second Commission's thunder by pre-empting some of their recommendations at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem however that there is a more serious basis for opposing the Bill. I have no doubt that the drafters of this legislation had the very best of intentions in mind when they turned to their task. However, it is not unfair to suggest that they did not consider as fully as they might have the implications of changing the brief of a small independent, investigative and enforcement body which was established with a specific focus on equal treatment between the sexes in the sphere of employment.  Experience of the operation of anti-discrimination <Col N="1373" /> agencies, which is considerable in the area of discrimination of one form or another &mdash; especially those established in the United States and Northern Ireland with a special brief to deal with employment matters &mdash; suggests that a wider range of choices exist with regard to the role of such bodies than would appear from this Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by several speakers that the administrative arrangements proposed in the Bill are over centralised and threaten to impose the excessive burden of having to carry too wide a range of competences on a single small agency.  The proposers have not reflected adequately on the Employment Equality Agency's discharge of their unique statutory brief during the past 15 years.  They also appear to have misperceived the United States experience which is typified by a diversity and variety of techniques of enforcement and a lack of centralisation of initiatives and resources.  It seems that there is great validity in the criticisms of the Bill alone this line put forward by the Minister in his speech in the House on 10 March.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Employment Equality Agency have had a number of fine successes and they should be noted here but it is well to recall the background against which the Employment Equality Agency were established.  They draw their statutory authority as an independent body from the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  They were given three specific statutory functions or duties: first, to enforce the status on employment equality; second, to promote equal opportunity between women and men and, finally, to review on a continuing basis the existing law.</P>
    <P>The agency have worked for over 15 years now and have established a fine track record.  They have established an authoritive voice in the area of sex discrimination, raised public awareness of the incidence and variety of discrimination, highlighted the need to ensure that adequate remedies exist in law and consistently emphasised the need for real progress in the area of equality. The agency have also highlighted the <Col N="1374" /> need for a strategic approach to women's training and pressed &mdash; this is a matter I dwelt on the last day &mdash; for a national framework of child care.  In spite of all these fine achievements I suggest however that the agency have a less than distinguished record when it comes to the issue of enforcement.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the agency were also given the strategically important role of enforcing the law on equality in the public interest.  In this area some critical analysis of the role of the agency has been produced. Professor Deirdre Curtin of the University of Utrecht has produced a particularly incisive analysis.  In her analysis she has described the agency's quasi-judicial powers as constituting an &ldquo;important strategic weapon in the battle to eliminate, in particular, indirect sex discrimination in employment or unequal pay for work of equal value.  Through such investigations the Agency can deal with general discriminatory practices in industries, firms or institutions.  Moreover, they can encourage positive action so as to obtain equal opportunity in employment&rdquo;.  That quotation is taken from <i>Irish Employment Equality Law</i>, Dublin, 1989.</P>
    <P>Professor Curtin has noted in her analysis that the agency have conducted only four formal investigations in a 15 year period and have never had recourse in any of these to the full range of their quasi-judicial powers.  She concludes that the few investigations undertaken reveal the lack of a coherent strategy in the agency.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that the agency have consistently complained of an acute lack of funding, Professor Curtin has expressed disappointment at the agency's tendency to engage in promotional and educational work in general rather than exercise their strategic enforcement powers.  A further quotation from Professor Curtin's work illustrates this.  She suggests that the agency should be more active in this area and states:</P>
    <P>In order to achieve the full potential of the legislation the Agency must use on a planned and systematic basis the <Col N="1375" /> powers the legislation has conferred upon it.  An essential tool in this respect could be an increased use of the formal investigation powers.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Bill before us is likely to push the agency further towards promotional rather than enforcement activity.  I suggest that none of us would like to see this happen.  The reality is that other jurisdictions where such agencies have been established, in particular Northern Ireland, Britain and the United States have encountered problems in developing the role and capacity of strategic enforcement agencies which can seek out discriminatory patterns and practices and bring the law to bear on them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it gives us an opportunity to look at this most important area.  The Minister has stated he expects the institutional concerns which I touched on and which he touched on the last day to be addressed in a clear-sighted way by the Second Commission on the Status of Women in their report which is due out this summer.  Rather than enact a Bill, no matter how well intentioned, which has clear flaws Members on all sides of the House should encourage the Second Commission to swiftly complete their task and focus on improving what is already in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and this debate on it.  I commend The Labour Party for their initiative and Deputy Taylor for his speech last week. Although I could not be here for the opening of the debate, I noted the contributions from the Dáil Official Reports that were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roche's speech was interesting, although I did not hear all of it.  I did not see the research the Deputy mentioned, but it makes a good case for the changes this Bill will bring about.  What we need is an equal status agency which will deal with education, promotion and with the pursuit of cases through the courts.  Most of us realise that the Employment Equality Agency has been strapped in terms of proper reform legislation <Col N="1376" /> and funds and I am sure any criticism of the agency will be taken in that context.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a minimum measure required to broaden the rights of women. Indeed, this measure is required under our obligations under the UN Convention for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women which we ratified on 22 December 1985.  Under Article 2 of that Convention we must introduce legislation to enable access to the courts in all instances of discrimination. At present, our legislation deals only with work-related discrimination and its pursuit through the courts but it does not cover the areas of goods and services, clubs or other areas of discrimination.  In 1985 when I as Minister of State for Women's Affairs involved in preparing our submission for the UN Convention and for the UN end-of-decade conference which was held in Nairobi in that year, we had to prepare certain reservations because we had not all the legislation ready and we wanted to ratify the Convention.  At the meetings held in Vienna for this Convention the need for access to the courts for women who felt they had been discriminated against was stressed.  Our Constitution does not afford the full legal protection envisaged by the UN declaration.  I would like a Ministerial speaker to indicate the intentions of the Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> our obligations under the UN Charter, because the reservation still exists in our accession.  I am not sure when there will be a review of it, but we will be required to introduce legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>Other speakers put this debate in the context of difficulties for women in this country because of the Supreme Court judgment on the case of the pregnant raped girl of 14.  One can be forgiven for asking &ldquo;what status are we talking about?&rdquo; What woman has status here, given the appalling developments we have seen in the last month where many women are reduced, in perception, to breeding machines.  The recent debate and the various pronouncements from political, judicial and religious fora not only diminished the value of women as <Col N="1377" /> persons and made us feel devalued as persons, but also scaled women down to the level of incubators in many instances. It was extraordinary the way the woman's anatomony, feelings, intentions and emotions were discussed by people who could never know the pain and the stress of a suicide-inducing pregnancy or the horror of rape.  I am not saying that one has to be female to know the fears, the horror and despair of pregnancy due to rape, but I am sure it helps.  I want to convey my disquiet at how these issues of women's conditions ever got into the realms of constitutional discussion and judicial deliberation and analysis on the highest level.</P>
    <P>On this issue we have let ourselves down again.  We have once again shown that the really unacceptable crimes in Ireland are related to sex and morals and we reserve our greatest self-righteousness for those who offend against the conformist norms, and women regrettably, again and again are inevitably the centre of focus, as an outcome of this.  As a woman leaving these shores, I find it difficult not to skulk away, conscious of the baleful glances of people from other civilised nations.  They feel sorry for us and although I am proud to be an Irish person abroad, one cannot get away from the fact that it is difficult to explain the quite extraordinary oppression that appears to come from our Constitution in many instances, from our courts, and from the lack of achievement by women.</P>
    <P>The dilemma which we are going through at the moment must be resolved for all women, particularly for our daughters. I care how that resolution comes about.  We must have an honest, open resolution that gives Irish women back their dignity as people and gives them the freedom to enjoy the right of travel, to have access to information on their health and the right to have access to non-directive professional counselling.  In this matter, this House must show whether it is a responsible Parliament of a true republic, by legislating for the rights of all citizens regardless of religious beliefs, or whether it will again creep away and seen to be held to ransom by ungenerous <Col N="1378" /> and narrowminded zealots, and again let the courts, the European Community or English clinics do our work for us.</P>
    <P>I want to co-operate and help in reaching a resolution that is fair and equitable. I do not want the matter to dissolve into a bitter battle that does not do any credit to anybody but which particularly gives no credit to politicians.  I am not encouraged by the evasive attitude of the Taoiseach in the Dáil today.  The Taoiseach is a leader who has promised to open the shutters, to have open Government and to do things differently.  It is towards the Taoiseach we look for action.  Up to now we have not had enough action.  We need more than gestures.  Indeed, political gestures are what Irish women have had in large measure from our political institutions. In every area, this country is at the bottom of the league of rights and entitlements for women, when compared with women in other European countries.</P>
    <P>What is the background on those issues?  Despite the fact that we have had numerous reports, numerous seminars and very loud calls from women at work and indeed couples at work, there has been no political response with regard to child care.  We have not established even the basic network of child care facilities. Child care does not exist officially. Women at work might just as well be putting their kids in the deep freeze for the day, for all this State knows or cares. That is not <i>de facto</i> equality.  Contraception is another issue which is very much a women's issue.  In this area we still have bizarre legislation seriously limiting the places and ages for availability of contraception, with emphasis in the legislation for research funds only towards so-called natural methods.  That is not <i>de facto</i> equality.  When we look at the workforce, we have huge clusters of women workers in low paid service jobs while they are almost non-existent in the upper grades.  That is not <i>de facto</i> equality.  We have mothers in the home full-time, rearing children and perhaps looking after aged parents.  They have no intrinsic right in a share to the family home because <Col N="1379" /> they are not income earning.  That is not <i>de facto</i> equality.</P>
    <P>Equal pay legislation has not been satisfactory.  There is a disparity in average earnings which has been highlighted repeatedly between the levels of pay of men and women.  For instance, women earn 68 per cent of the rate enjoyed by men in manufacturing industry.  Women make up 70 per cent of all clerical workers.  In the electronics industry they represent 74 per cent of operatives and only 3 per cent of managers.  Such statistics are reflected throughout the workforce. When women get married and have children they are not able to pursue their careers or to compete in the same way as men.  The levels will not balance out without special measures and direct action, matters with which this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>Some sections of the Bill are indeed welcome.  Sections 4 and 5 deal with the prohibition of discrimination by employers in access to employment, conditions of employment, work training and work experience, promotion or regrading. I welcome Part III and the changes in regard to the burden of proof.  These have long been sought by the Employment Equality Agency.  The onus of disproving discrimination will be on the person denying discrimination.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the recommendation in section 45 dealing with golf clubs.  There is to be a prohibition on public funding for associations or clubs which discriminate on grounds of sex.  This is a necessary provision in legislation.  Up to now we have attempted to encourage, cajole, request and beseech the organisations and associations which govern clubs, particularly golf clubs, to change their discriminatory ruling which does not enable women to become full members and, in many instances, does not allow women to become members at all.  This section would make it impossible to prohibit the full membership of women or to marginalise them by offering associate membership.  The explanatory memorandum states that no payment or grant may be made out of public funds <Col N="1380" /> to any such club.  That is to be welcomed. It also states that no such club may apply for registration or the renewal of registration under the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904.  A club which is not registered under this Act is not permitted to sell or supply excisable liquor to its members for consumption by them or by their guests.</P>
    <P>Some small success can be measured in the context of the refusal of EC improvement grants where clubs continued to discriminate.  We need legislation to prevent it happening.</P>
    <P>This Bill and this debate hold up a mirror to women to see what has been achieved and to examine Government responses to reasonable requests for change.  The responses so far will not have women jumping for joy.  The Minister for Labour is certainly no latter day women's libber.  His speech showed a marked lack of insight or understanding of equality needs.  I accept that one should give him the benefit of the doubt because he is a newly appointed Minister. His objections to the Bill are strange and not spelled out in real terms.  For the most part I found his speech difficult to understand.  He stated:</P>
    <P>. . . it threatens to swamp or marginalise what has come to be recognised as the most serious and pervasive form of discrimination in our society &mdash; the practices which operate, directly and indirectly, to isolate, segregate or even eliminate the contribution which women can make in all areas of employment.  In addition, the Bill seems, by virtue of the attempt to put such a wide range of issues into a single legislative measure, to reflect an overemphasis on the effectiveness of legislative enforcement mechanisms, <i>per se,</i> to the detriment of other complementary methods of developing good practice.</P>
    <P>That Civil Service English does not seem to make sense.  If it were clearer we would know exactly what the Minister is thinking.</P>
    <P>The mirror will show something else. The representation of women here has been a focus of public interest in the past <Col N="1381" /> month when women, deeply concerned about the abortion debate, wanted to have time in the House to express their views.  Many people realised how small we are in number &mdash; 13 out of 166 Members.  We will never amount to a serious lobby either former women in politics or for women's issues and issues related to the family.  There is one woman in Cabinet and there are two women Ministers of State.  To round this off, we have a junior Minister whose responsibility for women's affairs is sandwiched between cultural affairs and European affairs.  That does not instil a great deal of confidence in anyone who wants to see change and a creative approach to the women's agenda.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the Second Commission on the Status of Women and promised some kind of nirvana following the publication of their report.  I am aware that the report is due in the summer and I have not the slightest doubt that it will be splendid.  Women and women's organisations took it in great earnest.  A record number of very detailed and well-researched submissions was made.  It is always helpful to have clearly delineated submissions.  The chairwoman, Miss Justice Mella Carroll, has wonderful skills and a great deal of commitment and all the members are hard working and dedicated.  I have high hopes that this report will create as much political stir as the first report produced under Dr. Theckla Beere.  I have no great confidence, however, that when the report has been published and the path has been set out we will see any great change.  I am certain that the report will call for funds for child care, new work practices, job sharing, longer maternity leave, better training and so on.  These are all costly and we will probably be told there are other priorities.  I do not know what we will do with that report.  I believe that because of the cost factor involved it will be shelved.</P>
    <P>Women here have such a low status that substantial remedial measures are needed now.  We are talking about rights and entitlements but also about tapping the talents, experience, skills and <Col N="1382" /> energies of half the population who, traditionally and by our laws, have been oppressed and marginalised and have not been taken very seriously.  We are talking about redressing the balance of the sexes. One person who has unashamedly attempted to redress the balance and, indeed, by the work is a shining example of public service to Irish people here and abroad, and is a special inspiration to women in this country, is President Mary Robinson.</P>
    <P>One of her recent speeches in Trinity College struck a note as to what is needed in this area.  I will refer to that speech she made at the Allen Lane Foundation Lecture in Trinity College on 25 February. The title of the speech is &ldquo;Striking a Balance&rdquo; and she said:</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise here at the start that the balance I would like to see struck is not an awkward coming-to-terms or a last minute compromise.  Far from it.  It must be a comprehensive reassessment of the place and contribution of a woman in her society.</P>
    <P>If the imbalances of the past came, as I believe they did, not simply from legislative injustice and economic inequality but from profound resistances and failures of perception, then it follows that to right that balance we must do more than review our legislation and re-state our economic structures. We must also fundamentally reappraise our view of who and what is valuable in our society.  We must look with fresh and unprejudiced eyes at the work of women, the views of women, their way of organising and their interpretation of social priorities.  To achieve this, we must, I believe, begin at the beginning and alter our way of thinking.</P>
    <P>President Robinson went on to say:</P>
    <P>We cannot strike a balance until we right the imbalances which already exist.  In the area of women's equality this has meant, and still means, rearranging the order of participation and the access to self-expression, so <Col N="1383" /> that men and women have an equal chance to make their contribution and find their creativity in a society which neither owns and both share.  But how are we to achieve this?</P>
    <P>That is the question that this debate poses.  We have to strike a fair balance; we have to redress the imbalance.  This legislation goes a long way towards that objective and I will be supporting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, though well intentioned, contains fundamental flaws which could threaten to undermine the substantial progress which has been made in the promotion of equal rights between men and women and seriously sets back the cause of equality between the sexes in this country.</P>
      <P>The prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origin is something to which all of us as legislators aspire and work towards.  I believe that the specific means proposed by this Bill would only result in legislation which would be confused, complicated and less effective in dealing with the promotion of equal opportunities in employment than the current Acts provide.  In particular, I believe that the most fundamental, and powerful discrimination confronting this society is based on sex and I believe that tackling this whole area is of such importance that it demands specific legislation in its own right.</P>
      <P>We must address whatever discrimination exists against other groups in our society on whatever grounds it may occur, but much of this discrimination afflicts both men and women and can be dealt with through separate legislative proposals.  To categorise sexual discrimination with a myriad of other discriminations could mistakenly dilute the particular and sizeable problem of sexual discrimination and give succour to those who object to the promotion of equality between men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate on discrimination is <Col N="1384" /> timely.  Discrimination in all its hideous forms remains one of the major ills of modern society.  Indeed, in recent years we have all seen the rise of neo-fascist and extremist National Front movements in a way unequalled since the Second World War.  The success of the extremist National Front in France's regional elections last weekend, for example, and the constant presence of neo-Nazism and extreme right wingism in Central and Eastern Europe, should be constant reminders of the threat which hovers over us all.</P>
    <P>Less dramatically the discrimination of ageism seems to be growing apace.  It is now virtually impossible for older people to find new employment once made redundant, despite however well qualified they may be.  Can any of us deny the continuing discrimination, often unintentional, based on handicap or membership of the travelling community? Again and again, however, our practical experience of discrimination will focus on discrimination between the sexes if only because that is where each and every one of us can most easily see it happening or imagine it occurring.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is appropriate at a time when we are reflecting so closely on the Maastricht Treaty to consider the impetus which our membership of the EC has given to the application of the equal opportunity principle in employment in Ireland.  The role of Europe and the Maastricht Treaty have come under close scrutiny in the light of the recent Supreme Court decision on the right of a young girl to travel, and I would be as concerned as any to ensure that nothing in the Maastricht Protocol should in any way discriminate between Irishmen and Irishwomen regarding any of their rights &mdash; particularly the right to travel, but I recognise that to date Europe has played an extremely constructive role in our own campaign for greater equality between men and women.</P>
    <P>Both the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, owe their origins to EC Directives. The principle of equality in employment between men and women enjoys <Col N="1385" /> a special status under EC law and the Community has since the mid-70s gradually built up a wide ranging legislative code which at present consists of five equality directives that cover pay, employment and vocational training, aspects of statutory and occupational pension schemes and self-employment.</P>
    <P>In fact, equality policy enjoys one of the most successful and advanced records in the employment area at Community level.  This has been underlined by the inclusion of a provision in the Special Agreement on Social Policy, which was concluded by 11 member states of the EC at Maastricht and which will probably make it easier to enact further equality legislation at Community level after the adoption of the new Political Union Treaty.  As the Community's standards in this area have taken on the character of an organic code, it is clear that the principle of equality is open ended.  Ideas are developing all the time on what behaviour is acceptable and what constitutes unlawful sex discrimination.</P>
    <P>In advance of the Maastricht Summit, the momentum of equal opportunity policy was reinforced about this time last year by the endorsement that the Council of Social Affairs Ministers gave to the European Commission's Third Medium-Term Community Action Programme on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women for the period from 1991 to 1995. The significance of this programme lies in the fact that the European Community has made a political statement to the effect that, while significant advances have been made in promoting the status and dignity of women in our society, much remains to be done to build on the achievements of the 1970s and 1980s by intensifying these activities in the 1990s.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed by the third action programme have been articulated around three key issues.  The first issue is the implementation and development of the law in relation to equality.  The action proposed in the third programme will seek to ensure the implementation and development of existing legal procedures; deepen understanding of the specific issues relating to equal pay for <Col N="1386" /> work of equal value and the concept of indirect discrimination; and raise the level of awareness of legal rights and obligations.</P>
    <P>The second key issue addressed in the programme is the integration of women into the labour market.  The action proposed here will seek to increase the participation of women in the labour market by developing specific measures to promote women's employment and enterprise and local employment initiatives; improve the quality of women's employment by maximising their potential, particularly through action relating to education, vocational training, a better management of resources and the use of positive action in enterprise; and reduce barriers to women's access to and participation in employment, particularly through measures aiming to reconcile working life and family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve these objectives, the Commission undertook to implement a new Community initiative for the promotion of equal opportunities in the field of employment and vocational training &mdash; the NOW initiative &mdash; and to continue its actions in the field of employment.</P>
    <P>The third key issue addressed in the programme is the improvement of the status of women in society.  It is considered that, in order to achieve lasting progress and a real change in attitudes, awareness raising initiatives need to go beyond the sphere of employment.  The action proposed will, therefore, aim to continue and develop awareness raising initiatives which are related to the specific objectives of the action programme and improve and disseminate information on equality issues; continue to encourage an improvement in the participation of women in the media industry and to develop innovatory programmes and materials which portray positive images of women; and encourage measures designed to promote the participation of women in the decision-making process in economic and social life.</P>
    <P>It is most important that the progressive development of our law in relation to equality &mdash; particularly in the sphere of employment rights &mdash; should <Col N="1387" /> proceed with due regard to the way in which European Community law has developed over the past 15 years.  The EC medium-term programme has set out clear objectives for the development of equality laws.  The Minister for Labour has reiterated this Government's commitment to bring forward proposals for legislation to amend the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, in fulfilment of the undertaking given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It is the Government's intention to bring forward a single comprehensive measure on equality between men and women in employment which will ensure that, for the first time, all the relevant law on employment equality can be found under one cover, a very important step.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Labour Party Bill before us, despite its ambitious and praiseworthy attempt to draw upon a wide range of sources, would leave our Statute Book in an even more confused state than before.</P>
    <P>The medium-term programme on equal opportunities explicitly calls for greater clarity and coherence in the development of the core concepts of employment equality law.  It especially emphasises the need to raise the level of awareness of employers and workers alike about legal rights and obligations. These objectives can be realised only by means of a new and comprehensive statute to deal exclusively with employment matters.  Such an Act would ensure that it would no longer be necessary for practitioners, equality offices, the Labour Court and the higher courts to continually refer to different sources of law located in a variety of different texts. The aim should be to construct a single and comprehensive code framed to meet current Irish employment circumstances and reflect the applicability of European Community law.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this Bill does little to assist practitioners, not to mention managers and those conducting negotiations in employment or those considering <Col N="1388" /> whether to put forward claims relating to equal pay or sex discrimination, in arriving at a clear understanding of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Instead of advancing a comprehensive new code, this Bill proposes to introduce a new statute alongside the remnants of the two earlier Acts.  That would hardly serve to make the content of the law accessible or comprehensible to the public.</P>
    <P>There is a further danger that by casting its net too wide and covering too many diverse areas, the Bill might actually undermine the influence of EC law as the main source of our domestic law on employment equality.</P>
    <P>However, a proper strategy for achieving greater equality of opportunity cannot rely exclusively on legislative action.  The European Commission stresses that its strategy for action calls for a real commitment on the part of the social partners, who will have a central role to play in the practical achievement of the objectives defined in the programme, as well as in integrating equality of opportunity into the ongoing social dialogue.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, for example, contains important commitments in the area of training and employment opportunities, such as the increase in FÁS targets for the training of women in nontraditional occupations and the relaxation of the live register requirements for eligibility for FÁS training for women who wish to return to the formal workforce and other important proposals in the area of childcare.</P>
    <P>We have a good record in this vital area compared with that of our European neighbours.  A key step to be taken is to seek the final report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women due shortly.  It is my belief that this report will form an important basis for a detailed plan of action in ensuing years, thereby promoting the dignity and status of Irish women, helping to ensure their full participation in the economic, social, political and cultural life of the country while, simultaneously, exploiting their <Col N="1389" /> enormous skills and talents fully for theirs and our benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill introduced by Deputy Spring seeks to replace the basic model of the existing equality Acts with a new hybrid Bill which would extend the prohibition of discrimination beyond gender to include sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality or ethnic origins, including members of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour has already observed that, in endeavouring to cover too wide a field, the provisions of this Bill may even pose a threat to the effective operation of well established mechanisms and procedures which have served to advance women's interests in the employment sphere over the past 17 years.  I would have grave reservations that the provisions of the Bill, if implemented, would have damaging implications for the smooth operation of essential services, such as the Defence Forces and prison service.</P>
      <P>The operations of the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, have been the subject of continuous review by the Department of Labour in the light of experience of their enforcement, developments in other European jurisdictions and the European Commission's action programme on equal opportunity. Changes have been effected in the provisions of that Act to bring some hitherto excluded occupations or areas of employment within their scope where they have given rise to concern that the protective considerations which inspired them were no longer well-founded.  The effect of these changes has been to ensure that equal opportunity is assured in access to midwifery courses and employment in single sex institutions, most of which are associated with health, education and welfare services.  In addition, changes were affected in 1985 to modify significantly the scope of the blanket exclusions which had applied under section 12 of the 1977 Act relating to employment within the Garda Síochána, the prison service and the employment of close relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> Following representations from the European Commission that the exclusion of these categories from the scope of the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, did not fall within the exceptions provided for in the 1976 Directive on equal treatment of men and women in relation to access to employment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions, the then Government decided to change the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, so as to bring employment in the Garda Síochána and the prison service within the scope of that Act.</P>
    <P>The effect of the European Communities (Employment Equality) Regulations, 1985, in the prison service has been to limit necessary exemptions from the stringent requirements of the legislation to certain categories of posts only. Such exemptions cover posts where it is necessary, in the interests of privacy and decency, for a staff member of one sex to supervise offenders of that sex, for example, while offenders are dressing, undressing or in the case of personal searches, also where the duties of the post include guarding, escorting or controlling violent persons, quelling riots or violent disturbances.  Both categories of exemptions apply only where a prison governor does not have already sufficient employees capable of undertaking the relevant duties, whom it would be practicable to employ for that purpose. Implementation of those regulations had to have regard to the unique nature of the prison service and the duties of prison officers.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Bill before us &mdash; through its proposed repeal of section 17 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and its total disregard for the specific provisions of the 1985 regulations &mdash; threatens to ride roughshod over the type of arrangements put in place to promote equal opportunity and mixed staffing within the prison service.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces were specifically excluded from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  I might add that a similar position obtains in other member states of the EC, in that <Col N="1391" /> those countries have withdrawn their Defence Forces from being the subject of the EC's Equal Treatment Directive. However, some countries maintain legal barriers preventing women from taking up posts in military service.  In recent years the recognition of equality standards and, in some countries, a shortage of volunteers, has directed more attention to potential openings available to women.  For example, here the Defence Amendment (No. 2) Act, 1979, for the first time, permitted the enlistment and appointment of females in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In addition, the provisions of the Bill before us seek to override all existing legislative arrangements for the regulation of Army personnel, flying in the face of similar arrangements worldwide. It has been the policy of successive Governments to provide women with access to membership of the Defence Forces to the maximum extent possible, having regard to financial constraints and the fact that women are employed in a non-combatant role.  However, the requirements of national security are never likely to permit circumstances in which access to employment in the Defence Forces would be influenced by legislation designed primarily for persons not subject to military law.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is of the view that the role of females in the Defence Forces should be expanded.  In that respect a board has been established to examine the overall question of the employment of women in the Defence Forces, all aspects of their service, including allowing them access to all appointments within the Defence Forces and their participation in operational duties, being considered.  That board, which includes two famale officers, are due to submit their report shortly.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 12 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the alteration of the provisions of the 1985 Regulations &mdash; as proposed in this Bill &mdash; would not have any adverse implications for the planning/management of equal opportunities within the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> It appears already that sufficient progress has been made since 1985 so that recruitment, allocation of staff and promotional procedures within the Garda Síochána fully satisfy the rigours of the Employment Equality Act, no longer necessitating any modification of its provisions.</P>
    <P>The progress made in the development of career opportunities for women in our police force is confirmation of the Government's continuing efforts to promote equal opportunity in employment and to review any occupational areas wholly or partly excluded from the application of equality laws heretofore.  The next step will be for the Government to introduce the comprehensive reforming Bill about which the Minister for Labour spoke earlier in this debate, within which it is intended to incorporate all the necessary revisions of existing Acts and various regulations, thereby ensuring a single legislative measure containing all the relevant law in relation to sex discrimination in employment.</P>
    <P>Of course, the provision of equal opportunities in the workforce is not only a legal issue; it also happens to represent the most sensible usage of human resources.  In turn, this means equal opportunities will be attained not only through enforcement of the law but also by an acceptance on the part of employers and employees alike that the full utilisation of the talents and resources of the overall workforce is in our economic interst.  Thus it is sound business practice to encourage and assist all employees to develop their full potential.</P>
    <P>This Government had adopted positive action policies in three key areas &mdash; the Civil Service, public sector bodies and within the training and employment bodies.  In addition, arrangements for monitoring the implementation of policy in these areas have been put in place, intended to set an example for the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the provisions of this Bill do not seek to bring these information-gathering exercises within its legislative scope.  This is probably a sensible approach at this early stage of <Col N="1393" /> their evaluation.  The Commission on the Status of Women may be expected to consider whether a case exists for extending the current monitoring system operated for State-sponsored bodies to the private sector and perhaps underpinning it with some legislative obligation to return statistical information.</P>
    <P>The system of monitoring in State-sponsored bodies commenced in 1990 and requires such bodies to devote more attention to equality, provide certain baseline data on their performance and indicate their goals and targets for the future.  Last year the system was extended to local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>The other positive action measures which feature in the Government's programme are, first, the active efforts by the Manpower agencies to break down traditional barriers between the sexes in the labour market.  The best known example is the FÁS positive action programme which aims to encourage increased female participation in growing future orientated sectors of the labour market and sectors traditionally dominated by men.  Second, the provision of empirical information making it clear that the labour market is heading for such radical changes that people will have to choose occupations in technically more sophisticated fields in order to have any real prospect of employment.  Third, the connection between educational choice and employment prospects and the need to encourage both men and women to disregard sexual bias in their occupational and educational decision-making. This applies to young persons choosing vocational education and training and also to adults choosing in-service and further training.  Fourth, the need to counteract preconceived notions on the part of employers and employees concerning what are suitable jobs for men and women.</P>
    <P>While legislation has a crucial role to play in the achievement of equal oportunities in employment, it needs to be complemented by positive action developments at every level.  There is a real danger that the all-encompassing <Col N="1394" /> legalistic focus of the Labour Party Bill will overload the mechanisms already established to combat discrimination based on sex in the employment sphere, dissipate resources and deflect attention from the kind of initiatives already under way to promote changes in social behaviour on a voluntary basis.  The Government's commitment to promoting positive action at national level is illustrated in the commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> These developments, together with the commitment by the Minister for Labour to introduce a single comprehensive statute to reform the law on employment equality, are evidence of continuing progress.  However, these measures represent only the first generation of equality standards.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women can be expected to take these into account and to identify new objectives and measures of achievement.  The conclusions of the commission, which should be available in the summer, should lay the basis for a second generation of equality measures which could well encompass some of the wider areas identified in the Labour Party Bill.</P>
    <P>This debate can do nothing but good if all the more positive contributions and proposals are taken on board and co-ordinated. This would ensure that further progress is made in the promotion of equality for women.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, will continue their endeavours to promote equality for women and will do everything necessary to ensure that all forthcoming legislation will be geared to that end.</P>

      <P>The one point on which there has been agreement in this <Col N="1395" /> debate so far is that there is discrimination, and it is rife in Irish society today, but the nub of the debate is the manner in which we tackle this problem. There has been a marked departure this evening from the position adopted by the Government Deputies who spoke last week, namely, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, and Deputy Síle de Valera. They said that the Labour Party Bill was a catch-all Bill and as such was not acceptable. I found it very difficult to accept what Deputy de Valera had to say.  She said that the Bill attempts to do too much too quickly.  She then went on to say that sexual harassment was not included in the Bill and for that reason she could not support it.  She said first that the Bill was a catch-all Bill and then that because it did not deal specifically with sexual harassment she could not support it. There is a contradiction in those statements. This typified the Government's approach to the Bill last week.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend a political commentator in the media said that part of Fianna Fáil's problem is that they have not yet shed the cult of the begrudger. There is much truth in that statement, particularly when one bears in mind that the legislation which has been referred to constantly in this debate &mdash; the anti-discrimination Act and the employment equality Act &mdash; were introduced by a Coalition Government, of which the Labour Party were a member.  It was Labour Party Ministers who introduced those Acts in 1973 and 1977.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, gave credit to Deputy Charles J. Haughey, who was then in Opposition, for setting up the Commission on the Status of Women. Even though Fianna Fáil were not in Government at the time, they claim credit for setting up this commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the debate has centred on the very definite discrimination against women but there is a large grey area which this Parliament has yet to address. Women have been referred to as the half paid section of the community.  I believe <Col N="1396" /> women at work have been exploited shamelessly down the years.  Reference has been made to the part-time workers legislation introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy B. Ahern, when he was Minister for Labour.  I argued the points in that legislation with Deputy Ahern when he was Minister for Labour. However, when it came to the crunch issue of a statutory minimum wage, he buckled and did not attack the issue with full vigour.  Every effort made by people on this side of the House to put forward proposals for a statutory minimum wage &mdash; the first step in the real abolition of discrimination in the workplace &mdash; has been resisted by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, and his predecessor.</P>
    <P>Various Government speakers have referred to what has happened in Europe in the area of social legislation.  They say we are no longer an isolated island and that we are part of the overall European Community.  What has happened in the European Community?  How have our Government behaved in the European Community?  Under the Social Charter we will have to abolish discrimination in the social area, yet, Ireland together with Mrs. Thatcher's Britain &mdash; I refer to her rather than Mr. Major because most of these discussions took place when she was Prime Minister &mdash; have been accused of being the two countries regularly opposed to the introduction of real social standards in Europe.  As a result the people who are dependent on the social services have been discriminated against because we did not have the courage to face up to the problem.  This has been scientifically investigated and it has been proved beyond doubt that this country reneged on the social charter and did not do what it should have done in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse referred to the growth of the National Front and the rise of right wing groups throughout Europe. A Member of the Oireachtas, in recent times, would do credit to Jean-Marie Le Pen or any other extreme right wing group in this attitude towards the hippies and social legislation.  It is very easy to attack people because they do not have anybody to fight for them.  It is discriminatory <Col N="1397" /> when a Member of the Oireachtas says that certain people are exploiting the system because they wear their hair long and may be a bit unkempt in their appearance.</P>
    <P>How many itinerant children go to a second level school?  How many of them reach third level education?  How many of them are in insured employment?  Very few.  It is time the Government took responsibility for solving this very serious problem and relieved the voluntary organisations in this regard.  I am not suggesting that people in voluntary organisations are not qualified but we need people to apply themselves professionally to the problem which seems to be growing annually.  I was chairman of an itinerant settlement committee in Cork Corporation and we were within a very short distance of resolving the itinerant problem, particularly in the provision of houses.  Of course, that is only the beginning.  However, due to the upheaval in Northern Ireland, itinerant families moved to the South and suddenly the problem seemed to get out of hand. There is a need to take a fresh look at this area of discrimination.  I do not know whether total integration is the proper solution to the so-called itinerant problem. Are halting sites the answer?  I appreciate that there is a 100 per cent grant available to any local authority who takes it on themselves to provide these facilities for itinerants but there is a need for greater involvement by the Government and their agencies in this regard instead of leaving it to the voluntary bodies who are working against tremendous odds.  If we do not resolve it it will get worse.  It may be convenient to ignore it but it will not go away.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a directive was sent to local authorities telling them that a quota of disabled persons should be recruited by each local authority.  I wonder how many local authorities have responded to this directive.  I would imagine very few because I have failed dismally in any attempt I made to secure employment for a disabled person.  Local authorities told me that, due to cutbacks, they cannot afford to employ disabled people. <Col N="1398" /> However, that is an attack on the weaker section of the community.  They also say that they do not have the facilities to accommodate disabled workers.  It would not do to put a disabled person beside an able bodied person in case he became a burden on him; that seems to be the approach.  In a caring society this is an area which must be addressed.  Some people will live out their lives totally dependent on their next of kin, if they are fortunate enough to have families to care for them.  We cannot give them the dignity they deserve unless we provide the facilities for them.  This area of discrimination is largely ignored.</P>
    <P>Are our elderly people being discriminated against?  I would say that, very definitely, they are.  I am tempted to say that we have a policy of creeping euthanasia inasmuch as we do not provide sufficient hospital spaces for our elderly citizens.  We are keeping people alive longer yet the State does not provide hospital accommodation for people needing long term care.  We could have the awful situation of a mother who is incontinent forced to leave hospital and go home to live with her two bachelor sons.  She would be regarded as taking a bed from someone younger than her who might have a better chance of survival.  Is that not discriminatory?  Where is the equality in that case?  It is not good enough to treat all the children of our nation equally, we will have to pay attention to what we are doing to our senior citizens.  They are in a very disadvantaged position at present and there is no way they can be accommodated.  Until such time as we are prepared to do something positive about this, old people will end their days in utter misery.</P>
    <P>At present some employers are taking advantage of the recession as many employees have a take home pay of £90 per week.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, referred to the number of women who are exploited in the workplace. Married women in the 40 age bracket are recognised as being the most exploited of all.  The reason is that they are vulnerable and are unfairly taken advantage of.  If we introduced a statutory <Col N="1399" /> minimum wage, as I said in my opening remarks, it would alleviate that problem.  A fixed sum per hour in respect of a particular job would solve the problem.</P>
    <P>There is also discrimination in education. We were told that the cutback in ESF grants is to permit a greater distribution of the available funds to those who most deserve them.  Maybe the proposal was well-intentioned but the fact is that we are now discriminating against people who, for the first time, have broken out of the poverty trap by virtue of the fact that they had access to third level education.  As a chairman of a vocational education committee I am very conscious of what is happening.  In many cases the eldest child in a family would be the first to achieve a place in third level education.  What is now happening is that the second and maybe the third child will not have that opportunity. It means that we take one step forward and two steps back.  That is not the correct way to do it.  Are we satisfied that there is positive discrimination in favour of the underprivileged in all third level institutions?  There are factors, apart from points, which should be taken into account when an assessment is being made for entry to universities and regional technical colleges.  We would eliminate discrimination by, in effect, a form of reverse discrimination of ensuring that there are sufficient places for the underprivileged and for those whose family income is such that they could not afford to send their children to further education.  What is happening in that regard is very disturbing.</P>
    <P>In regard to advertising, why does the female form seem to sell more articles than the male form?  Fortunately, there is a marked decline in the exploitation of women in this area but it is still not enough.  The practice of draping a graceful woman over the bonnet of a car to sell more models is archaic.  That practice has to be stamped out once and for all.</P>
    <P>One of the disturbing aspects of the comments of Government spokespersons is their emphasis on the legal mechanisms <Col N="1400" /> necessary to implement the Labour Party Bill.  We accept that there are bound to be problems but when that is measured against the hardship imposed on people as a result of inequality, it is a very small technical detail.  How can one measure human suffering against the smooth running of an administration? We must put the emphasis on the human being who is affected by the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, has not been in office very long and that it is not possible for him to eliminate all the problems in a matter of weeks.  I welcome this commitment to tackling these problems. But some of Deputy Tom Kitt's comments were not helpful.  Having listened to Deputy Kitt describe what he did last week as Minister of State, one would think he was God's gift to women.  Truthfully, some of what he said was quite disturbing and I wonder if he is living in the real world.  Deputy Kitt outlined his involvement with the various committees and the Employment Equality Agency. His smarmy response to Deputy Taylor's contribution offered no hope.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat annoyed and disappointed by some of Deputy Cowen's remarks because I know he is capable of more than this.  He referred to chainsaw confetti and salami techniques but there is no place for such cliches in a serious debate such as this.</P>

      <P>This is a very serious debate.  I hope the new Minister and his new Minister of State will adopt <Col N="1401" /> a new approach and cast aside the reservations their predecessors had in coming to grips with this problem.  When opening this debate on behalf of the Labour Party, Deputy Taylor said he was prepared to accept amendments.  There is nothing to prevent any Member putting forward an amendment for consideration. That is the way to tackle the Bill.</P>
      <P>Before I hand over to my colleague Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, may I thank the Chair for his indulgence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">

      <P>I hate to interrupt my colleague, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, in full flight.  He was doing a very good job.  I detected that Members on the Government benches welcomed this Bill although some problems were highlighted. Naturally we expected some criticism of it, that is par for the course. I did not detect any animosity to the Bill except from one or two Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor made a generous gesture to the Government parties when he suggested that Committee Stage be staggered in order to get the Bill right.  The people who criticise the Bill should be given the opportunity to table amendments on Committee Stage.  We should examine them with a view to taking them on board.  We should all work together.</P>
      <P>This legislation is very necessary.  Some people refer to this as a catchall measure. It is a comprehensive Bill which covers discrimination in employment, the Labour Court, disposal or management of premises, goods and facility services, education and a wide range of activities. Some people believe we are doing all right as we are.  They believe equality can be doled out year by year, that if we take one step this year we could go a step further next year.  However, that is not what equality is about.  Equality is a right of people, groups and communities.  We make no apologies for introducing this so-called catchall Bill.  Very careful thought was given to this comprehensive legislation.  Many people were involved in preparing what we consider very necessary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my experience of working on the <Col N="1402" /> factory floor I know that discrimination is practised widely despite the legislation enacted by this House.  I should like to point out, at a time when we are discussing the Social Welfare Bill that the greatest discrimination is against women who work outside the house.  If a married women earns more than £55, even £1 over the £55 limit, her husband will lose his allowance for a dependant.  The woman will have to give up the job if her husband is to retain the £37 allowance. That is discrimination.  The allowance should operate on a sliding scale.  For example, if the woman earns £56 the allowance could be reduced by £1 to £36. This would be an equitable way of dealing with the problem.  It is discriminatory if the husband loses the total allowance when his wife goes over the limit.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies dwelt, and rightly so, on discrimination in the workplace. Although legislation was introduced to tackle this problem, there is a great deal of discrimination in the workplace.</P>
    <P>We should also consider the discriminatory practices against young people.  For example, a young person is discriminated against when he or she tries to get car insurance.  Young people under a certain age will not get car insurance. When we discussed this problem at a meeting of Cork Corporation last night there was unanimity that the Minister should act immediately to counteract this blatant discrimination against people on the grounds of age.  The insurance companies have not produced the statistics to show that people under a certain age are more likely to have an accident.  If a young person manages to get a job where he needs to drive a car he is discriminated against immediately if he or she is under the age the insurance companies have set, be it under 25 or under 23.  Tomorrow it could be under 30 years of age.</P>
    <P>My colleague touched on the problems of the handicapped.  No later than three weeks ago Members were shamed by the fact that a young mother had to go to the High Court to get an injunction so that her severely handicapped child would receive an education, something to which every child is entitled.  We talk about <Col N="1403" /> treating all the children of the nation equally but that is the most abused phrase I know of in our Constitution.  It is time we legislated to outlaw discrimination.</P>
    <P>We have asked for support in principle for this comprehensive Labour Party Bill. All parties will have an opportunity to table amendments on Committee Stage and improve on the Bill.  I appeal to the Government parties to accept the Bill in principle.</P>

      <P>Again I compliment the Minister on bringing in such an extensive Social Welfare Bill this afternoon.  When I mentioned abuse it was not my intention to embarrass the Minister or his officials. What I was trying to establish was the importance of having more people on the field to counteract the abuse which is taking place.  Every party in this House would agree that there is quite an amount of abuse and that it is depriving the genuine recipient of an adequate income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to means testing, I would applaud the Minister if tomorrow morning he were to come into the House, on Committee Stage, and provide for one means test.  If the person could carry a certificate of clearance to show he had already been interviewed by the Social Welfare officer when he applied for a medical card, a third level education grant, a housing grant or whatever it might be, it would eliminate the need to go through a degrading exercise of being means tested by different officials on different occasions.  I plead with the Minister &mdash; I know he is big enough and strong enough &mdash; to ensure that his officials start working on this matter forthwith to <Col N="1404" /> ensure that this harassment of people ceases once and for all.  There should be one assessment and then entitlement for all other benefits.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I wish to begin on a positive note by saying I welcome very much the Minister's intention to bring in a consolidation Bill on Social Welfare.  I once said to his predecessor the best thing that could happen in this country would be that all social welfare offices would go on fire the same night and that every rule book in the place was burned, so that he could start afresh with a simple set of rules.  Having said that I want to almost contradict myself by reading out an example of what I think is gobbledegook in the Social Welfare Bill, 1992. Section 27 (9) states:</P>
      <P>The amount payable by way of unemployment assistance for any day of unemployment shall be one-sixth of the appropriate weekly rate, subject to the total amount being paid at any time by virtue of this subsection being rounded up to the nearest 10p where it is a multiple of 5p but not also a multiple of 10p and being rounded to the nearest 10p where it is not a multiple of 5p or 10p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What civil servant &mdash; although I should <Col N="1405" /> not mention civil servants here &mdash; got a brainstorm and would not round it up or down to the nearest 10p and leave it so?  Consolidation should mean that that would be pressed out of existence even though it is the new instruction.  It is very important that Social Welfare Acts, rules and so on are consolidated.  It is difficult to understand why one person receives £1 more than another.  It is very difficult to understand the reason for the differential of £1 or £1.50 between what a lone parent receives and what somebody else receives.</P>
    <P>Having commenced on a positive note I am now about to go into a negative line for the next 20 minutes.  My pet aversion is the manner in which medical referees go down the country with their little magic travel bag and sit down in a bare room opposite a patient who is under medical care in one of the major hospitals in Dublin under the chief medical expert and with the magic of their eyes and by flicking through a few pages they can decide a person is fit for work.  I do not want to appear as if I am making a personal attack on medical referees <i>per se</i> but the system is incredible and has to be completely wrong.</P>
    <P>Everybody here tonight will know of cases where patients who went to specialists in Dublin were on special medication, were sent home and had to come back the following day for further tests.  Low and behold, they are called before a medical referee who decides they are fit for work.  On one occasion I received a letter from a professor in one of the Dublin hospitals who stated clearly that the medical referee did not understand the medication the person was taking.  I would ask the Minister to take a special look at the manner in which people who are ill are being treated by the system whereby medical referees can decide, without any examination whatsoever, that a person is fit for work.  Having expressed this point previously, I hope my words will not fall on deaf ears on this occasion.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I raised here in the Dáil, the difficulty being encountered by a person who was looking after two <Col N="1406" /> DPMA holders.  Because she was treated as having an income &mdash; half her husband's earnings &mdash; of £52, £54 or £55, her application for the carer's allowance was disallowed. I admit to having received a half promise from the Minister's predecessor that he would favourably consider doubling the income limit for that person.  It is indefensible that if a women is looking after two handicapped people or two elderly people who have qualified for the carer's allowance, they should be confined to an income that relates to one person.  I am not asking that she receive a double payment each week.  I am merely asking that if £52 is the qualifying income limit, if she is caring for two qualified people, she be allowed an income of £104.  It came as a surprise to me to learn there are hidden regulations in this Bill. I heard people discuss certain matters on the radio, and even though I had examined the Bill, I could not find any reference to them but it appears certain matters will be introduced by means of regulations.  The Minister should bring in a regulation to double the qualifying allowance.</P>
    <P>Another serious aspect of social welfare for those of us who are dealing with it on the ground relates to the self-employed person who is being assessed on last year's payments.  This must be unconstitutional.  A typical example would be a carpenter who had worked for a certain part of last year and is signing on this year.  He will discover that he has a mythical income.  In a case which I am dealing with at the moment the person &mdash; with four children &mdash; has a mythical income of £105 per week based on what he earned last year.  He happens to be one of the people who was rarely on the unemployment list because he was always working but this year he cannot find work.  What he earned last year was divided by 52 and he was told he has an income of £105 per week.  It is incredible that in 1992 we can pretend people can survive on money they have not got, but which they are told they have based on what they earned last year.  The Minister, the civil servants who advise him or I could not survive on the money we <Col N="1407" /> earned last year because most of us have already spent it, and indeed more.  If the strike at the banks does not come to an end soon we could find ourselves in greater difficulty.  How could anyone justify telling a man with a wife and four children that he has an income of £105, even though he cannot find work?</P>
    <P>I do not want to give too many examples as the Minister has come across them himself, but I know of a painter who was honest enough to inform the officials that he was asked to paint two houses one summer, but the following year they took into account the sum he had received for painting these two houses and decided he had a certain income per week, even though he painted no houses in the months of January, February or March.  He then had to beg for the supplementary welfare allowance.  As Deputy Wyse said, this was very humiliating. I would love to know who came up with this idea of deciding that a person has a certain income based on what they earned the previous year.  I hope the Minister will examine this matter because I believe if someone took him to the High Court they could win their case.</P>
    <P>The general increase of 4 per cent about which we have heard so much will not make anyone rich.  Indeed, at one stage I thought the Minister was losing the run of himself when he started one sentence by saying that &ldquo;the 4 per cent general increase will ensure&rdquo;&mdash; for one second I thought he was going to say that people would live in luxury for the rest of the year &mdash; but he completed it by stating &ldquo;that for the fifth successive year since 1987 increases in social welfare payments will keep ahead of inflation.&rdquo; Given that the rate of inflation is running at 3.7 per cent, they are not being given a great chance.</P>
    <P>I share the view that it is a myth that people on social welfare are living the life of Reilly, that they are being given everything free and so on.  Having regard to the fact that they have to endure great hardship to get these payments &mdash; and they do not amount to much when they do get them &mdash; they are of little benefit <Col N="1408" /> to them.  What can one do with £65 a week?  The people who look on the unemployed and those on social welfare as using up all our resources are lucky they do not have to survive on a pittance, because that is what most social welfare recipients get.  While we always hear about the person who is abusing the system &mdash; he is in receipt of twice as much as the person next door who is working &mdash; it is often very difficult to find out who exactly is guilty of such abuse.  There will always be some who will abuse the system; Solomon himself would not be able to sort them all out.  In general, it is farcical to suggest that people on social welfare are living in luxury.</P>
    <P>It was decided in 1988 that the self-employed should be given pensions if they pay a certain sum.  As previous Ministers did nothing about this matter, there is not much point in putting too much pressure on the Minister, but I proposed that the self-employed should be given a <i>pro rata</i> pension after they have paid contributions for seven years.  Given that a person is given a full pension after ten years, there is no reason a person who has paid contributions for six or seven years should not be given either six-tenths or seven-tenths of this pension. While it has been explained to me that, in theory no one should be given a pension after ten years &mdash; one would need to contribute for 25 years to cover the expense &mdash; if it is accepted that a person should be given a full pension after ten years, the logic behind giving seven-tenths of a full pension to someone should also stand up to scrutiny.  Perhaps the Minister might consider this suggestion when he is less busy.</P>
    <P>The payment to widows is far too small.  They have to carry a double burden &mdash; they have been left on their own and have to do the work of two in rearing a family.  They receive the same allowance as those who do have the same responsibilities, although I accept they do not have enough.  If we ever get to the stage where we have money to spend, widows should receive a double increase because, as I said, apart from the question of finance, they have many other <Col N="1409" /> problems.  While I am fully aware of the position in relation to the State's finances, I would like the Minister to bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>As regards means testing, the process takes far too long.  When a person rings the office in Sligo he finds the file has been forwarded to the social welfare officer; and when he rings six weeks later he finds the file has not been returned. There must be something wrong with the system given these delays.  I do not know who is at fault but it is unbelieveable that it takes so much time to make a decision once an application is made to the office in Sligo.  This matter needs to be examined because in fairness those who apply for help should have their applications processed quickly.  If they need money, there is not much point giving them a lump sum a year after they have suffered mental torture; there is a need to deal with their problems quickly.</P>
    <P>While I accept the Minister will have to defend his civil servants, there must be something wrong with the system given that it takes so long to make a decision.  Either there are not enough social welfare officers to carry out investigations or there is too much book work. As I said, it is incredible that it takes so long to make a decision.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is foolish to interfere with PRSI because this amounts to an insurance payment and one is entitled to receive it.  If we start to tamper with it, we will be tampering with democracy. As I said, it is foolish to suggest that redundancy payments should be taken into account and that people should be clobbered on that basis.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing his time with me and for being so generous because I am aware he has a keen interest in this matter and would have liked to have spoken much longer. As this is my first opportunity to do so, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him every success in this important Ministry.  He is seen as a man with some flair but I can assure him that this Ministry is choked with red tape. I am sure also that he is aware from <Col N="1410" /> experience as a Deputy of the great annoyance this Department caused.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, social welfare payments would seem to be generous but it is a bit like offering somebody the birds of the forest &mdash; catch them yourself.  The regulations are mindboggling and one would need a lawyer to tease them out. Even then, it seems that a different answer is given every time.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister is the man to sort this out and I hope he is successful.  I do not want to be negative each time I come into the House, but I suppose that is the duty of the Opposition. However, I expect the Minister to do something about this problem.</P>
      <P>The attitude of social welfare inspectors seems to be that everyone is an abuser, a criminal and not to be trusted. Applicants are questioned at every opportunity.  This is wrong because they are honest and decent people who are dependent on social welfare through no fault of their own.  It is not right that those in authority should treat them in such a manner.  A social welfare applicant is taken into a room, which is poorly furnished at the best of times, abused and interrogated.  This is happening not only in my home town but in social welfare offices throughout the country.  While I accept that their means must be assessed, these people are questioned on the basis that there is hidden income.  Would the Minister inform the social welfare officers that there is no hidden income?</P>
      <P>It is nonsense to think that people have money in the mattress and under the bed. That is pure rubbish.  Some old bachelors or old maids living alone save a pittance in order to have a decent funeral.  They do this because they have experienced hard times and they are afraid what might happen when they die.  If they have saved £1,000, why should there be a question about it?  Should they not be given credit for looking after themselves?  In the meantime, it is our duty to make life comfortable for them without being abusive about it.  That is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> The carry on with regard to social welfare and small farmers is outrageous.  I accept that there has been an improvement in the last six months but that has only come about because the country generally recognises that these people do not have large incomes.  However, many social welfare officers are still not aware of that fact.  What training in agriculture have social welfare officers to enable them to discern farm income?  A small farmer with three or four cows might have two or three calves, but the social welfare officers seem to believe that every cow has two calves.  If some of these officers were given land they would become millionaires, considering the outrageous figures they suggest for smallholders. They do not take into account the cost of running a farm.  It is time that nonsense was finished.  The social welfare officer will tend to say that a farmer should not have his farm if it is a liability but tending cattle and looking after the holding is a form of therapy for many small farmers and, if it was taken away, many of them would end up in institutions. They should not be treated in that way.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance was applauded when it was introduced but, again, like the birds in the forest, when one went to look for it one simply could not get it. Every obstacle was erected.  That is wrong.  We have an aging population with a few young people left to look after them, but where people are prepared to look after them, they should be compensated. If an aged person is not looked after at home the alternative is an institution, and that will cost the State hundreds of pounds a week as against the meagre £35 or £40 carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Many a girl and boy has given up the prospects of married life to look after aged parents.  That sacrifice was readily made.  Craw thumpers and do-gooders who do nothing for anybody might ask why they should not look after their old people because we all did it.  That attitude is wrong.  The Minister should adopt a more lenient approach to the carer's allowance.  He should not question their <Col N="1412" /> incomes.  A widow's son was refused the carer's allowance because on investigation it was found that he had six cows and was not fully engaged in looking after his aged parent.  That man never left the house at night to go out socially in case something might happen to his mother but they cut off this income.  That is very wrong, as well as being annoying and frustrating.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy Browne said about the widow and the widow's pension which does not take into consideration the stages at which her children are at school.  I know of a case where a widow's allowance for one week was used to pay fees for her son to do his leaving certificate and a daughter to do her intermediate certificate.  There are many people like that widow.  We all know the cost of sending children to second and third level education.  Why should not the children of a widow or a single parent have the same opportunity as children with both parents?  Should those children be deprived of education through no fault of their own?  We should take a broader view of this issue.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with regard to prisoners, although it is not a big issue in my county.  However, I am aware of young lads leaving the prison in Cavan and travelling to whence they came, without an allowance.  Weeks might lapse before their unemployment allowances come into play.  The circumstances for many of these young lads are not great.  They are penniless when they return to Dublin or some other town, and they have no alternative but to return to crime.  There should be a social welfare officer in the prisons to look after young people due to be released who should ensure that social welfare payments will be available for them or find employment for them.  They should not be sent out penniless because then their only alternative is to return to crime.  I am aware of two such cases and I am sure there are many others.</P>
    <P>With regard to health matters, the decisions made by some social welfare officers are outrageous and many family doctors are upset at these decisions. Doctors are issuing certificates and social <Col N="1413" /> welfare officers are questioning them, saying the people are able to work.  By doing that they are saying the doctor is acting in a fraudulent manner and he is committing a crime by issuing the certificate. That is a slight on the doctor's integrity.  I have absolute confidence in the medical profession.  When a person is not able to work a doctor will issue a certificate to that effect, and as soon as the person is able to work the certificate will be discontinued.</P>
    <P>Some people will abuse any system, but we should not slight the medical profession by questioning certificates and saying that people are fit for work when the doctor has certified them as being unfit for work.  I am surprised that the medical profession have not made more of a fuss about this.  The social welfare applicant is then caught between two stools.  His doctor says he is unfit for work and the Department put pressure on him saying he is.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take particular note of my points in relation to farmers income.  I would also like him to take note of the changed circumstances of people in small businesses.  Because of supermarkets, people are looking for better value for money.  In the Border region particularly, many small businesses are finding it hard to survive. People keep up a good front and keep the shop looking well, but in many cases there is no food on the table.  When these people apply for social welfare benefit &mdash; and many of them are now applying for it &mdash; it is assumed that they are quite well off because they may have a car. However, they are not because they do not have sufficient income and are fighting to exist.  Thankfully, the competition from Northern Ireland is fading.  It is not all one way traffic, but there are many people travelling North looking for value for money.  They cannot be blamed for doing that.  As I said a social welfare officer visiting a person in a small business might think there is plenty of money there, but there may not be bread on the table.  That is the bottom line.</P>
    <P>People in country houses have great <Col N="1414" /> pride and keep their homes well.  They must get credit for that, but can they put food on the table?  Many of them are on the breadline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity, in the House, to congratulate the new Minister for Social Welfare.  It is an appointment long overdue.  I hope he brings to his new portfolio the innovation and open attitude which he has brought to politics in the past decade.  If he does so, there should be significant changes and consequences.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of general points relating to the social welfare system.  The first concerns the system of means testing for young people which is far too restrictive and very disillusioning for those who leave the educational system.  Many are debarred from receiving unemployment assistance or have their assistance reduced to negligible proportions because they are living at home or may have a brother or sister who is working.  Account is not taken of the fact that the brother or sister may be preparing for married life and may not necessarily make any funds available to a sibling.  The income of their parents debars many young people from unemployment assistance, although that income may not be very high.  Young people signing on the register may receive as little as £10, £7 or £5.  This is fundamentally wrong.  Young people who reach the age of 18 are entitled to vote and are expected to behave as adults.  They should be treated accordingly in the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restrictions on the payment of unemployment assistance do not yield any great savings to the State.  Many young people leave the family home and move to rented accommodation which is often of a poor standard.  They may end up receiving supplementary welfare payments towards their rental outlay.  Alternatively, they may join the public authority housing lists.  The Minister might consider this matter over the next year or two with a view to making the system more responsive to the needs of young people.  It is disillusioning for them <Col N="1415" /> to find that they are not treated as adults, as independent citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the severity of the medical referee system.  There can be differences of opinion between a medical referee and a general practitioner but when evidence is received from specialists, particularly in relation to back and other injuries, confirming that a person is not capable of work, that evidence should be accepted by the appeals officer.  If that practice were adopted, it would probably improve matters somewhat.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined today the resources we are spending on social welfare. The incredible figure of £3.36 billion was mentioned.  We should have a radical reappraisal of the system and ask if that money can be spent in a more positive way in terms of putting people to work, particularly those leaving the school system.  There is a need for the Department of Education, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour to come together on this issue to see if money can be channelled towards training for work or actual employment. This might give better value for money. This morning on radio a suggestion was put forward that a subsidy of £20 or £30 to employers might achieve greater employment and a consequent reduction in social welfare payments.  We must seriously consider such options.  The indications are that employment figures will rise still further.  We will be depending on a shrinking productive base to support an ever-increasing dependent class.  It cannot go on.  The three Departments I have mentioned have a crucial role to play in employment creation.  We cannot look at the Culliton report in isolation.  It deals specifically with industrial policy. We must link it to the resources provided for social welfare and the question of education and training, with a view to getting better value for money.</P>
    <P>I have been struck by what I consider to be the very low level of payments to widows.  They are the poor relations of the social welfare system.  There have been tremendous improvements in many <Col N="1416" /> categories but consideration should be given to the case of widows, particularly those with children attending school or third level colleges.  Very often they do not even get tax breaks.  If widows are forced into the workplace to support their families they find the system working against them in the form of severe taxation and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the complexity and multiplicity of services available in the social welfare system.  I welcome the announcement today that a new Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill will be published within the year which will help to simplify the system.  It is difficult at times to comprehend its wide range.  Previous Ministers for Social Welfare have done much work in consolidating, streamlining and simplifying the system.  This Minister has rightly put the matter on his agenda.</P>
    <P>I question the view that the social welfare system constitutes a disincentive to work.  By and large the vast majority of people are unemployed because of prevailing economic circumstances and the fact that work is simply not available. That should be acknowledged.  A trend has been emerging whereby people depending on the social welfare system are labelled as layabouts who do not want to work.  My experience of dealing with people looking for work is quite the opposite.  We have economic difficulties, in common with other countries, which have given rise to unemployment.  The unfortunate consequence is that people have to draw social welfare.  It is a cornerstone of our party's policy and philosophy that we should be a caring and compassionate society and that we should look after people who, through no fault of their own, have to draw social welfare. It is extremely important that we continue to implement that philosophy, that we look after the less well off in society and that, as the Minister said, we target the scarce resources that are available to the particularly needy groups.  The Minister is endeavouring to achieve that objective in this Bill.</P>
    <P>For the fifth year in succession the Social Welfare Bill gives general <Col N="1417" /> increases in social welfare payments above the level of inflation.  This contrasts very favourably with increases given by previous Governments.  It is an illustration of our party's genuine commitment to those on social welfare and to the less well off.  I am particularly pleased with section 6 of the Bill which allows for increases in the weekly income limit of those eligible for family income supplement.  The family income supplement scheme is a particularly good scheme.  The increases are generous, particularly for larger families.  This is an illustration of the Minister's attempt to target those with special needs and I am particularly happy with that section. Sections 10 and 11 which make modifications in the contribution conditions for old age pension and retirement pension are also welcome.</P>
    <P>The question of the carer's allowance has exercised the minds of many people since its introduction.  The concept was an excellent one and the allowance has considerable potential in alleviating much of the burden of the State. However, the implementation of the scheme leaves a lot to be desired.  I understand that resources are restricted but the allowance has led to considerable anguish in some families.  The system should be simplified so that the full carer's allowance is given to the carer.  For example, if a person being cared for is entitled to £20 the carer should be given £20.  I have witnessed a number of cases where the carer has found it extremely difficult to explain to the ill person why their payment has been reduced by £20 or £30. The fact that the carer's allowance was increased by that sum did not seem to be taken into account and this created a degree of anguish in families.  The bureaucracy should be simplified to ensure that whatever the person is entitled to is paid directly to the carer, thereby helping to alleviate the problems and leading to greater regard for the carer's allowance.  Even though the allowance has led to an increase in income for some households, many people have been very disheartened with <Col N="1418" /> the system and this does not reflect well on the Department or on the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 28 is an important addition to legislation introduced in the area of part-time workers.  The fact that any employee earning over £25 a week will be covered by social insurance from January 1993 and will be entitled to short term benefits on foot of their contributions after April 1991 is very welcome and is a clear illustration of our party's stance in relation to issues such as this.  The former Minister for Labour introduced legislation dealing with part-time workers and we have improved the social insurance dimension of social welfare legislation so that people who work part-time will be entitled to the fullest possible range of benefits.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about sections 29 and 31 which provide that redundancy payments be taken into account when determining entitlement to unemployment assistance.  To be made redundant can be a very traumatic experience. Redundancy payments are meant to tide the person over in the longer term. People who are made redundant need money on a long term basis to look after their families and it is unfair to use their redundancy payment as a determining factor in whether or not the person should receive unemployment benefit. That measure is too severe and should be reconsidered.  As we are witnessing at the moment, people who are made redundant suffer great trauma and tend to feel alienated from society.  Any measure in the social welfare system that might add to that alienation should be proceeded with very cautiously.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the section dealing with people who leave employment voluntarily.  Up to now, these people were subject to disqualification from unemployment assistance for a period of up to six weeks.  This Bill proposes that the times be extended to nine weeks. Frequent disputes take place between social welfare officers and recipients as to the definition of leaving work voluntarily. Quite a number of such cases have been brought to my attention at advice centres and in many cases I was of the opinion that social welfare officers were quite <Col N="1419" /> wrong in their decisions.  A person who is arbitrarily dismissed by an employer may not have redress under the Unfair Dismissals Act because the required time may not have elapsed and very often social welfare officers may take the view that such a person left work voluntarily. A dispute then arises because the person is deemed not to be entitled to unemployment assistance for up to six weeks &mdash; if this measure is passed it will be nine weeks.  This matter should be reconsidered on Committee Stage with a view to retaining the six weeks clause.</P>
    <P>Social welfare officers over the years have become quite severe in the application of this section, not only as it applies to people who leave work voluntarily but also in assessing whether people are genuinely looking for work. For example, it is a bit much to suggest that the 270,000 unemployed people are not looking for work.  It is quite clear that there is not work available for all these people.  Very often people ask employers whom they know to write a letter stating that they have applied for a job in order to satisfy the social welfare official that they are entitled to unemployment assistance. Publicans and others who have no work available write the standard letter stating that the unemployed person applied for work.  This is an area that needs to be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>Section 41 is an important section which offers scope for considerable development of the system.  The Minister mentioned An Post.  Not long ago we had an argumentative debate in this House on the whole future of An Post.  I was aware at the time that the Department of Social Welfare had approached An Post in relation to the computerisation of the system, a joint venture approach to certain services and so on.  The Minister's announcement in this regard is very welcome. Developments in technology and so on will open up considerable possibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, An Post have not developed as a semi-State body to the degree that they should have developed. There is a myriad of services that the <Col N="1420" /> organisation could provide.  A good marriage could take place between An Post and the Department of Social Welfare in terms of the distribution of services and so on.  In fairness, many steps have already been taken, for example, in the issue of pensions, but there is room for progress and an improvement in the services provided to the public at large.  That section of the Bill, which is welcome, does not relate specifically to An Post but to other organisations as well.  The Bill creates a framework by which certain administrative functions of the Department can be delegated to other organisations. That is a very important development which will lead to greater efficiency and better service.</P>
    <P>The basic aim of the Bill is to target resources to those most in need.  Within the very fine constraints that the Minister operates, he had made a very good attempt in that regard.  The Bill is a welcome progression in the whole social welfare system and I compliment the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>To go back to a major point that I made earlier, I honestly feel that as economic indicators show that unemployment will increase in the short term we must very seriously consider whether a proportion of social welfare expenditure could be spent more fruitfully in other areas, thereby creating opportunities, particularly for the young people entering the labour market.  Ireland has a population structural problem in that so many of our young people are due to enter the labour force in the next ten years.  Our proportion of young people entering the labour market does not compare with the proportion in other European countries. The social welfare system should endeavour to respond to that problem in the next ten to 15 years.  We should be imaginative enough to try to devise schemes whereby we try to improve the lot of young people rather than have them go straight on to the dole.  The provision of schemes to further vocational training, for example, would be much preferable than having school leavers immediately signing on in an employment exchange.  Such a practice is fundamentally wrong and <Col N="1421" /> unhealthy.  A principal aim of our policy should be that no young person leaving school should have to sign on a register. That is a bad experience and one that is not very healthy in terms of self-development or otherwise.  I know of other economies that have succeeded in doing that. There are models, particularly within Europe, that we should examine to find out how people have been integrated from the education system into training and work sectors.  I compliment the Minister on the Bill and I wish him every success in his portfolio.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I have already wished the Minister for Social Welfare well in his functions.  I should like to suggest to him &mdash; now that he has begun to see the grittier part of his job &mdash; that he should make a resolution, which would be very much in character with his own temperament, to decide that he will not allow himself to get caught up too much in the system but will occasionally be adventurous and move out of the system.  I am not criticising any of those working in the system, but there is a need for creative thinking there.  Deputy Martin indicated one area that displays a need for such thinking.</P>
      <P>Social welfare is very much an area in which Ministers have to lead and I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to do so.  I do have to point out &mdash; and I shall mention this again later on &mdash; that the Minister's immediate predecessor took a certain number of leads while in that portfolio.  Of course, for his pains, the former Minister for Social Welfare was criticised by some of the gurus who sit in the gallery some of the time as being a technocrat.  I have said before and I repeat &mdash; in front of a Minister who would never be described as a technocrat &mdash; that there is no harm whatsoever in being a technocrat if the result is that those who need the support of the State get that support delivered to them more efficiently than it has been.  I hope the Minister will add a little touch of the technocrat to the otherwise very exotic blend that already makes up his character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> There are many anomalies in our social welfare system that are oppressive and unjust but these could be remedied very easily if the Minister could gain an understanding of what the system is doing to people, decide on his reaction and take the kind of approach I have suggested.</P>
    <P>One of the cruellest and meanest anomalies in our social welfare system is the treatment given to dependent widowers or widowers of old age pensioners who are themselves under pension age at the time of their bereavement.  Our old age pension system rightly provides for a series of extra benefits in addition to the pension.  Those benefits include the free telephone rental allowance, free travel, a free electricity allowance, a free black and white television licence, a fuel allowance and so on.  All of those benefits are very useful additions to the old age pension.  However, for a dependent spouse of an old age pensioner, when the spouse has not reached the pension age, most of those benefits cease on the death of the pensioner.  The widow or widower, in addition to having to cope with the bereavement &mdash; a very traumatic event &mdash; then finds that she or he also has to cope with an immediate reduction in real income and an immediate reduction in real living standards.  It is no exaggeration to say that that system is cruel.  I have met several people in that position &mdash; and I am sure the Minister has also &mdash; and their distress is patent.  Those people are faced with an extra burden that the system should not and does not impose. I do not know just how many people would be affected in that regard in any given year, but I do not believe the number would be very large.</P>
    <P>To be cold and calculating about the matter, in the event that an old age pensioner died and left a dependent spouse who was under pension age, the State would make a saving because the dependant would be paid less than the pensioner and dependent spouse were being paid before.  And, as I have said, all of these benefits come to an end.  I suggest that the State might decide to save a little less in each of those cases.  I am sure that the Minister could give information in this <Col N="1423" /> regard, but cost involved in some of those cases is very small in that the actual use made by pensioners of the additional benefits, particularly the free travel, is limited.  The State would not incur as big a cost in continuing the benefits as might appear to be the position on the surface. I realise that we cannot ignore the fact that new people come into the pension net each year, and the Minister would have to take account of that in his calculations. Although the extra cost to the State of what I am suggesting would not be very large, there is no doubt whatever, as the Minister would agree, that the addition to the ordinary welfare of those concerned would be great.  That is a step that the Minister of State could take which would show a degree of understanding and compassion.  It is a measure that would be very much welcomed and would mean only a small extra cost to the State.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider my proposal seriously with a view to bringing forward an amendment either on Committee Stage or on Report Stage.  Given the impossible calendar that the Government have put before the House, the Minister does not have much time to bring forward the amendment by Committee Stage, but he should consider the proposal and then come back to the House and make a start by taking this very useful step.</P>
    <P>Ever since my former colleague, Deputy Gemma Hussey, assumed office as Minister for Social Welfare in 1986 there has been a very vigorous, proper concern to eliminate fraud and abuse from our social welfare system.  I am very glad that that has been pursued; it is quite right that it should be pursued in the interests of the people who would otherwise have to wait because the system cannot cope with them.  But I have two faults to find with the action taken over the intervening years.  The first is that, while a great deal of attention has been paid very rightly to the problem of fraud and abuse on the claimants' side, nothing like sufficient attention has been paid to the simplification of the system as constituting <Col N="1424" /> another means of combating abuse and abuse of claims.  I am quite ready and happy to concede that the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, took quite a lot of action in this regard &mdash; indeed I commend what he did in terms of simplification of the system, all of which has been extremely useful &mdash; but more action is needed.  A simpler, more transparent, social welfare system is doubly desirable in that a simpler, more transparent system makes it easier for people in need to know what their entitlements are and how to claim them.  Therefore, simplification and extra transparency of the system would be worthwhile on those grounds alone.</P>
    <P>There is a further advantage, that is the simpler, the more transparent the system the more difficult it will be to abuse it; the more difficult it will be to get around it and beat it.  In that way a simpler, more transparent system would liberate a greater part of the insufficient, although very considerable resources, we devote to our social welfare system to meet the needs of those people whose need is greatest.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that there is not ever a time &mdash; and I do not foresee it happening as far as I can look into the future anyway &mdash; that somewhat more leeway in the funding of our social welfare system could not be put to very good use to eliminate some of the anomalies to which I have drawn attention, or to deal with cases where we know, with the best will in the world, that whatever we might have to pretend from our positions in Government or wherever else we may be, there is need for some extra resources.</P>
    <P>The second fault I find with what has been done in recent years is that there seems to me to be an inordinate concentration on people, already in the system, on the part of people out there looking for fraud and abuse.  We see the same thing within the revenue system: it is much easier to look at or examine people who have been in the system for some years.  I have no doubt &mdash; it is sticking out a mile &mdash; there are abuses in that area but it seems to me, as a matter of observation, it is probably more likely <Col N="1425" /> that new applicants entering the system will include a number of people trying to beat it than any given population of people who have been within the system for some time.</P>
    <P>Like many other Members of this House I have to say I have come across a number of cases which can only be described as ones of blinkered, obsessive, time-consuming, money-wasting oppressive persecution of people who deserve a lot better from the system.  It seems to me at any rate that that applies particularly to people in receipt of disability benefit, a notoriously difficult area.  But some such cases seem to me to be very eloquent of the kind of obsession there is within the system.  I will give a case in point, that of a constituent of mine.  I suspect the Minister knows of the case also, apart from the fact that the Minister gets around a good deal, almost as much as I do myself, there are people who like to ensure they have all the angles of the case covered.</P>
    <P>This is an individual who first went on disability benefit in July 1978, over 13.5 years ago.  I have not been a Member of this House 11 years yet but I have lost count of the number of occasions that that individual has been cut off disability benefit, sent for medical examination, pronounced fit for work by the medical referee; sent off to sign on for unemployment assitance without the slightest reference to any of the general practitioners or specialists who have examined him over the years, all of whom have been paid for the provision of their services to him at the expense of taxpayers, courtesy the GMS.  There have been umpteen occasions when he has been cut off disability benefit, gone to medical referees, signed on, finally got unemployment assistance; found after a while there was no point in even trying to look for a job, gone back to a general practitioner, been referred to a specialist, put back on disability benefit, the Department having accepted him and, bingo, some genius comes along and decides: we will have to take a look at this man's case again, when the merry-go-round recommences, and it has been <Col N="1426" /> going round and round like that for 13.5 years.  I am appalled to think of the amount of Department of Social Welfare time, general practitioners' time, specialists' and consultants' time wasted on that man.  It is all time that would otherwise have been devoted to people who have been made to wait because the general practitioners, specialists and officials of the Department of Social Welfare, along with some in the Department of Health, are spending their time looking after this man's latest trip around the merry-go-round. Even in that case direct appeals to Fianna Fáil Ministers &mdash; who have the totally unjustified reputation of being good at understanding the grassroots &mdash; have failed.  The Minister's two predecessors have not sorted out that particular case for me.</P>
    <P>I would have to say &mdash; I am sure the gentleman in question would not hold it against me &mdash; it is no insult to him to say that, at this stage, he is not only incapable of work but he is now unemployable.  Part of the reason he is now unemployable is that, apart from anything else, his spirit and self-esteem have been broken by years of bureaucratic arrogance and ignorance in his case.  The system has made an enemy of that man who should long ago have been put on invalidity pension and allowed live out his days in peace with very modest needs and aspirations. In fact that man is really a victim of oppression within our system.</P>
    <P>I have another case, a much more recent one, not in my constituency but, as the Minister will know, if one is around for long enough, one will have people approaching one from other constituencies also for all kinds of different reasons.  This man retired some time ago on health grounds from a local authority. He is the type of person we public representatives are all used to meeting, of whom, fortunately, there are a great many nationwide.  He is a man who loves his work, who loves being at work.  He never pretended to have a job of any huge public importance; it was not a very high profile job, but that man loved being at work; he hated being out of work for any reason.  He hated having to take time <Col N="1427" /> off work because of illness.  But, for health reasons, he was advised by his doctor, backed up by a specialist, to retire on health grounds.  He retired on health grounds.  He is still a youngish man in his fifties.  He went along, claimed and was granted disability benefit.  His health has not improved since then nor is there any likelihood that it will improve.  But, sure enough, he has been told he must present himself before a medical referee for examination because, apparently, somebody in the Department of Social Welfare suspects he is not telling the whole truth.  What is that man to do?  His disability benefit has been stopped.  He has been advised to apply for unemployment assistance.  He feels it would be wrong to apply for unemployment assistance because that would amount to a statement on his part that he believes he is available for work whereas he knows he is not because he knows he cannot work. Clearly he would love to be available for work, but he feels &mdash; and this is commendable on his part &mdash; a reluctance to go along and claim unemployment assistance because in so doing he would be proclaiming he was available for work. What does he have to do?  In his mind he must go and make a liar of himself simply in order to get sufficient money on which to live.  Of course, there is the other complication: his disability benefit was stopped from last Saturday week.  He was told to go and sign on for unemployment assistance last Wednesday.  I do not know when that case will be finally processed but there is a fair bet it will not be processed by tomorrow, by Wednesday of next week or even the following Wednesday.  What will that man do?  He will go along to his local community welfare officer and apply for a supplementary welfare allowance.  In addition to the people who are sending him to a medical referree and the people who are processing his claim for unemployment assistance, another group of people are processing his claim for supplementary welfare allowance.  When the issue is sorted out they will have to go back over the file and claim back the <Col N="1428" /> supplementary welfare allowance from the unemployment assistance pocket and resolve the matter internally for the book-keeping of the Department.  What will happen?  If there is any justice in the system, the medical referee will come to the conclusion that this man is unfit for work and he will be put back on disability benefit.  The State will have had all that bother with no benefit to it and yet another citizen will be soured by the fact that he has had this kind of contact with officialdom and a system which is supposed to be there to support him.</P>
    <P>This man may very well have neighbours who are drawing unemployment assistance and doing nixers.  I would bet my bottom dollar that that man will feel a very decided grievance that he, who is unable to work and had to retire from a job he liked doing for health reasons, is being treated this way while his neighbours are drawing unemployment assistance, doing nixers and nobody is cracking the whip or coming down on them.</P>
    <P>I wish to cite a case which, unfortunately, goes back many years.  It concerns an unmarried couple who are living together.  They are separated from their spouses, with the agreement of their spouses.  The couple would like to get married to each other but they cannot do so because the Constitution and law do not allow them remarry.  I wish to diverge from what I am saying for a moment.  I have to say I was not one bit impressed by the parading of a new tender conscience by the Minister for Justice at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  It was funny to see him making his public confession, torturing his conscience in public and assuring us all that the progress of legislation would not be held up because of his personal ideas.  I am not sure I believe this anyway.  It was a well calculated piece of theatre for the cameras and delegates at the Ard-Fheis.</P>

      <P>If it is true, it makes his conduct, and that of his colleague, the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, <Col N="1429" /> in 1986 even more reprehensible.  There is joy in Heaven over a sinner who repents but Heaven does not expect sinners to take forever before they repent.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the couple about whom I was talking.  The woman in question is employed but as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned she is treated as a single person.  Her companion has a child from his marriage and he has custody of that child.  The woman is not the child's mother and she is not being treated as a single parent.  She is not treated as a parent at all even though she is very much in <i>loco parentis</i> to that child.  The man in question is unemployed and is drawing unemployment assistance. This man's child dependant is recognised but because he is living with another person who has an income he is being treated by the Department of Social Welfare as being married.  The woman is treated as unmarried and that is to her disadvantage.  The man is treated by a different Department as being married and that is to his disadvantage.  Between the two Departments and the two separate sets of rules this couple are losing out both ways.  I wonder where the justice is in that.</P>
      <P>Some people believe the State by its laws has some duty to protect the institution of marriage.  This is a case where they are preventing the institution of marriage from breaking out again.  They are also preventing these two people from looking after a child in the way they would if they were free to marry.  I see no sense or justice in that.  There seems to be a disjunction, a lack of continuity and a lack of consistency in the way that case is being treated by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  This is the kind of problem which should be sorted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest anyone thinks I am searching into the depths of experience for very <i>recherché</i> cases, as the Minister knows perfectly well, I am not.  The kind of case I have described is not at all uncommon in any town, village or rural area.  We were told the other day by this newly born liberal wing in Fianna Fáil, wherever they came from &mdash; I hope they are real and <Col N="1430" /> there is another wing to go with them so that the whole thing can take off and we will not simply see kite flying from the Taoiseach &mdash; in a leak in regard to the White Paper on marital breakdown that Fianna Fáil have suddenly discovered that 36,000 people are separated from their spouses and are living with the kind of difficulty which we tried to resolve in 1986 but which the mountainy men now on the Government side of the House prevented us from doing.  The Minister knows as well as I do that they are guilty of this.  It is a shame that these people are in Government and now parading their newly dressed consciences in front of the rest of us as recent <i>arriviste</i> liberals. I hope there will be another day for that debate in this House before too long.  In the case to which I referred, direct and fairly comprehensive approaches made to Ministers for Finance and Ministers for Social Welfare have not yet resolved the problem.  The couple are two more people who regard the State as an enemy.</P>
    <P>I cannot find any provision in the Bill which will deal with the kind of injustices created by rigid cut-off points in qualification levels for benefits where entitlements are related to means.  The problems are well known.  There is rich and abundant literature on the kinds of poverty traps created in our system by these discrete approaches and entitlement to benefits.  There is wide and abundant literature on the origins and nature of these poverty traps in our system but so far there has been very little response. I correct myself.  There is one provision in the Bill which makes a move in that direction and I am glad to see it.</P>
    <P>That provision relates to the family income supplement.  It is about the only part of our social welfare system where there is a recognition that these straight cut-off points create problems which do not need to be there.  We need to adopt a more gradual approach to the way we relate means to benefits and stop adopting this nonsensical system of having a cut-off point &mdash; if a person is £1 below a certain level he is entitled to everything but if he is £1 over the level he is not <Col N="1431" /> entitled to anything.  This type of system creates more problems than it solves.</P>
    <P>I would like to see that kind of injustice being dealt with because this, more than anything else, is the source of cynicism and disillusion with our administrative and political system.  Many people tell us how young people and others are being alienated from politics.  They ascribe this cynicism and alienation to all kinds of reasons.  However, the biggest reason is that people find their contact with the system, the administration, leaves them feeling bruised and disadvantaged.  It is not that they do not like politicians or because they think we are a venal corrupt group; it is because they have some kind of contact with the system, administration, which turns out to give a patently unfair result in the way these discreet means tests do.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend that it will be an easy matter to resolve these difficulties.  The answers are simple but they are not easy: they are simple in the sense that there is no mystery about how to deal with them but they are not easy in the sense that the answers require decisions to be made about where priorities will be put in our system.  They involve choices to be made about whether to take money away from one part of the social welfare system and move it to another or take money away from some other part of our expenditure programme and put it into our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Underlying the debate on this Bill is the very black reality of rising unemployment. In recent weeks there has been a great deal of sophisticated argument and clever political dancing about the issue of a jobs forum.  I take a very simple view of these matters.  The Government are wrong to pretend that the normal system of this House is sufficient to make Ministers accountable; we know that is not true.  There are votes in the House on Bills and the Government's 83 votes are whipped in.  Sometimes the Progressive Democrats mutter mutiny and reservations under their breath but they go through the lobbies and the Government's majority is assured.  Sometimes <Col N="1432" /> there are Private Members' motions or Bills and again the 83 votes on the Government side are whipped in.  The Taoiseach is insulated by those 83 votes against the kind of the top of the head reaction which we saw from his predecessor in May 1989, the biggest misgamble in the history of the last few years in politics.  The Taoiseach is insulated from that temptation because he has 83 votes.  If it is not a Bill or a Private Members' motion there are statements in this House which lead to no conclusion. It is regrettable &mdash; but it has been part of the traditional approach to debate in this House &mdash; that those procedures do not constitute any kind of real dialogue.  It does not have to be like that but it is the way it has been here up to now and the Taoiseach's vapid statements about consensus, dialogue, opening doors and letting in light have not been, so far, anything of substance.  I have not seen any indication in here that he means any of it.</P>
    <P>It is not as if other ways of resolving the problems have not been tried.  A little over a year ago the Government and the social partners tried to deal with this problem of unemployment.  They produced the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which was a failure from the word go.  Last November it was pronounced a failure by the Minister for Finance, the man who was the hero of the shining hour when the agreement was signed.  The programme will not do anything to increase employment, it was devised with the complicity of the Government, it was another assertion of the rights of the employed against the rights of the unemployed.  The social partners and the Government did not do the job; if anybody is to do it, it will have to be the politicians who were elected to do it.  It is about time that the Members and the people who write the columns in the Sunday newspapers got rid of the syndrome which led one of them last Sunday to say that the New Ireland Forum was set up to screw Fianna Fáil. We know that that is not the case, it was set up to make politicians do what they are elected to do, to make decisions. <Col N="1433" /> That is the way this House should be approaching the jobs forum and, to do that, there must be real dialogue between Ministers and this House, not the kind of stuff we see here in debates on Bills, Private Members' motions or statements. Until we take our job seriously we are failing the people this Bill proposes to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister as it is my first time in the House since he took office.  I wish him every success in his new role as Minister for Social Welfare.  As he comes from County Kildare he will not have any biased opinions in regard to what is happening across the country and will make a fair assessment of his role in the complicated system of social welfare.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and indeed this side of the House can claim credit for looking after the poorer people, the lower income groups and those who depend on the Social welfare system.  We always looked after those groups and we will continue to do so consistently during our term in Government.  There is a guide to the social welfare services consisting of 166 pages outlining the benefits under that system.  I wonder if the people entitled to social welfare benefits and assistance know their entitlements in full.  Most of the people in my area &mdash; who are not slow in examining legislation relating to the social welfare system &mdash; would not know their full entitlements unless they minutely scrutinise this document.  There are hundreds of various entitlements of which people are not aware.  Perhaps a leaflet could be published setting out the benefits in simple terms, which would be very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 1 to 9 provide for a 4 per cent increase under various headings and a 6 per cent increase in short term benefits. Having regard to our financial situation, this is a massive increase and something we were not expecting this year.  We also did not expect the increase of 6 per cent covering disability and unemployment benefits, short term unemployment assistance and the carer's allowance.  It also applies to a number of other allowances, <Col N="1434" /> including invalidity, persons over 80 years and so on.  I will not go through the list as I am sure other Members have read it, too.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the exemption of the proceeds of the sale of the principal residence from means assessment for pension for a person aged 66 years and over.  That is welcome because all a family's earnings are put into the household. It may be small but they have built it up and, when it has to be sold for a variety of reasons, the income from the sale is taken into consideration for means assessment.  I welcome the fact that the proceeds from the sale of the family's principal residence will not be assessed as income for social welfare purposes. Most people will welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>I am not very clear on the amendments to the rules for the calculation of means for pension purposes.  I would like to see this spelled out in greater detail but I presume this will happen on Committee Stage.  The explanatory memorandum talks about measures to streamline the system.  That is a very vague term.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives effect to the increases in the budget and the other additional helpful measures already mentioned. This would be grand if the measures were implemented properly, but I believe some criticism is warranted in this area. Some people are harassed when they are being assessed for social welfare payments. The social welfare investigating officer may believe that the system is being abused but I believe that the people applying for sick benefit, disability benefit, invalidity or blind pensions are sometimes abused.  I could give examples of hundreds of cases that I have come across from time to time of the person who comes from Dublin to adjudicate in the case, the medical referee, but he is known by different terms in the west, <Col N="1435" /> such as quack, a broken down medical man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He arrives to assess the social welfare applicant.  We do not know the gentleman's medical qualifications &mdash; although I am sure the Department will have an answer for that &mdash; but regardless of who has given a medical certification to the applicant, whether he is in hospital, about to be discharged from hospital or awaiting a call for an operation, this so-called medical referee will deem the applicant to be capable of carrying out his normal duties and therefore ineligible for disability, or sick benefit or any other appropriate benefit.  Even if the applicant has a certificate of illness from a physician, a surgeon or radiologist, or any specialist you care to mention &mdash; people who have clinically examined the applicant in their surgeries or in hospital &mdash; it is not worth the paper it is written on when the medical referee arrives from the city to examine the applicant.  Where does he carry out the examination of the patient?  Usually in a courthouse where there are no clinical facilities, and sometimes not even a toilet.  That is the way the system operates and it is a one hundred to one chance that the applicant will be deemed ineligible for benefit.  This is where I see the abuse in the system.  I want to see this abuse eliminated because it is disgraceful that sick people are treated in such a way.  People on social welfare get sick just the same as everybody else and they are entitled to a proper examination.  I would abolish the present system of medical referees and if a person in receipt of disability or sickness benefit is required to undergo a medical examination, he should be examined in a hospital or clinic where the facilities are available and the professionals can carry out the examination. That is the only way we can determine whether the applicant is entitled to benefit. I know the Minister could not stay to listen to the whole debate but I ask the Minister of State to tell him to abolish <Col N="1436" /> the old system and have medical examinations carried out by specialists in our hospitals.  Because it is only he who can give an accurate account of the person's state of health at that point.  I ask the Minister to take this on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means testing of small farmers give rise to abuses.  A small farmer is only entitled to unemployment assistance if he is available for work.  If he goes to cut his turf, save his hay or cut silage he is deemed to be unavailable for work and therefore not entitled to unemployment assistance.  Most of these small farmers have an acreage ranging from four to 15 acres and many farmers in my constituency do not qualify for a herd number because they do not have seven acres and a cattle crush.  Most do not even have seven acres.  The average holding in County Mayo is approximately 15 acres. How can you rear a family on 15 acres of land in the west?  Its capacity to hold cattle is limited but it is their only means of earning a living.  Why does the man remain on the small holding?  Usually he has to look after his father and mother who are old and disabled and are not in a position to look after themselves.  He does not qualify for a carer's allowance but if he increases his stock numbers or is seen to be improving his holding, the social welfare officers will be out investigating his means.  They make sophisticated arrangements, they travel by hackney car and for the most part they arrive during the summer months with their field glasses.  They love to arrive in Achill Island where the scenery is beautiful or in Louisburgh, or Bellmullet, areas which are so beautiful, too, especially between May and August.  Indeed I am sure they go to Connemara and Leenane as well.  They come out in summer.  I have asked that they be removed, and they have been in some areas.  They sit out on fine sunny days and, watch through their field glasses, the farmer footing the turf or cutting the silage to determine whether he is available for work.  If his wife takes up seasonal employment as a waitress in a small tourist area the husband has to look after the family and because he is doing that he is deemed to <Col N="1437" /> be unavailable for work.  Those people are being harassed by the social welfare system.  I would ask the Minister &mdash; I am delighted he is back &mdash; to ensure that that type of harassment does not continue in the future.  The people who are living there have to occupy their holdings and have to remain there.  It is often a liability to live on those holdings but they have to do so in order to look after the older people in the house.  That is something the Minister must examine and if it means a trip to the west I will show him many examples.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to take people to the nearest town, dispensary, clinic, hospital and so on.  Possessing a car is considered as income and being well off. As we know, most of those cars in the west are &ldquo;bangers&rdquo; which can breakdown at any time.  They do not cost very much but they are deemed to be motor vehicles so far as the social welfare system is concerned. That type of transport is a liability but it must be retained to take elderly people to church and to enable a small farmer to carry out his normal daily chores.  I am giving the Minister the facts but I will give them to him in a practical way if he should visit the west.  I will show him those people who are trying to eke out a living on small holdings and many of whom are being criticised for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to small fishermen.  I know many small fishermen who remain at home, instead of returning to England, in order to do some salmon fishing.  They, too, are watched going out to do their fishing and are investigated by the social welfare officers.  Those people pay £150 for their licence and they have to purchase <Col N="1438" /> expensive gear.  They must have a member of the family to help man the currach.  As soon as they come ashore a social welfare officer, who has been sitting on a high perch with field glasses, is waiting for them.  Because lobster tanks are a quarter of a mile from the shore these officers cannot ascertain the number of lobsters the fishermen caught because they are put into the tank.  They have to await the sale of the lobsters, which could mean waiting from one to two months.  The social welfare officers will then arrive to see what amount of money he got for the lobsters for a period of two months fishing, depending on the size of his tank.  Those fishermen with small incomes remain at home during the fishing season and then return to England to earn a small income for the upkeep of the family at home.  Those people are away in England for eight or nine months of the year and do not qualify for social welfare.  While they are at home they are harassed by social welfare officers.  That will have to stop.</P>
    <P>Young people in the west who are subjected to this type of investigation are fed up staying at home.  The first opportunity they get they are on the boat to the bigger cities to obtain employment where they will not be abused or harassed by this type of investigation.</P>
    <P>Ownership of the land is not being transferred from father to son or daughter. Immediately after transfer of ownership of the family farm, which ranges from four to 50 acres, there will be an investigation into the son's or daughter's means.  The father's or mother's means have already been investigated for old age pension purposes.  The son's means are investigated and in 99 cases out of 100 his unemployment assistance is reduced because he inherits the holding, which he did not have when he first qualified. Following the transfer of ownership the son or daughter is immediately penalised. They do not want to make any adjustment that will result in their social welfare benefits being reduced.  These investigations <Col N="1439" /> militate against the transfer of ownership of land.</P>
    <P>The installation grant is a good grant which was well intended but very few people in County Mayo will qualify.  I know of many people in County Mayo who qualified but are limited because they do not have sufficient land to meet the requirements of the installation grant.  In other places installation grants are worth £5,500 on which very little tax has to be paid on the transfer.  That does not apply in the smaller units and they do not bother to apply for it.  If there is any abuse of the system it is in the cities. It may be happening in the midlands too, where the farmer drives in with the land rover and brings the stable boy to collect the dole.  When he goes home his wife goes in in the Mercedes to bring in some of the domestic staff to collect the dole. It is very hard to identify social welfare recipients in the cities.  In rural areas everybody is known and there is no way anybody can claim benefits to which they are not entitled.  I am aware that there are some cowboys in the system &mdash; they are everywhere &mdash; but they are very limited in the west.  They are not limited in the cities because they cannot be controlled. Not too long ago we had a case where people who were working on a social welfare building came down off the ladders and went in and qualified for benefit, and then went back up the ladders again.  Although corrective measures have been taken in that respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the system is being abused in the city because no attempt is made to identify personnel.  For this reason, something will have to be done in relation to investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance was introduced in good faith.  I am afraid, however, that the number of people who qualify for this allowance is limited.  While it was introduced with the best of intentions the <Col N="1440" /> conditions attached to it are too harsh and as a result many people do not qualify. I would like to see them amended because we need someone to look after the elderly.  It will cost far more to care for them in hospital.  They should be cared for at home, if at all possible, and a substantial carer's allowance should be made available.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Woods, who did a great job.  He established both the regional boards and the appeals board. While I welcome the establishment of the appeals board, they are slow to announce decisions.  Perhaps the reason is they have to carry out investigations but I would like to see them operate independent of the social welfare system.  As their title suggests, they should be an independent appeals board.  Deputy Woods did much good work and introduced many schemes.  Indeed, there is a list 166 pages long which outlines people's entitlements which they may not be fully aware of.</P>
    <P>The small farmer has always been paid what is known as the supplementary allowance.  This is not deemed to be either unemployment assistance or farmer's dole.  This allowance should be based on the number of acres a farmer has without the need for a means test.  That would eliminate the need to carry out investigations.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say how much money the Department of Social Welfare have saved under the investigation system?  If we put expenses against savings, we will see there have been no savings.  How much money has been saved for the taxpayer and the Department, taking into account the travelling expenses paid to social welfare officers in carrying out investigations?  I do not think I have much more to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I congratulated the new Minister for Social Welfare on his appointment when he answered questions on social welfare.  A man with flair he has a reputation for thinking out loud and not being afraid to state his views.  It is a pity then that such a flamboyant Minister should introduce a Bill which will have a detrimental effect on the recipients of social welfare.  For the first time in the history of the State, the <Col N="1442" /> Government have bowed to pressure and introduced the concept of taxing disability and occupational injuries benefits. This is also the first time it has been proposed that certain benefits, normally paid for by way of contributions, be means-tested.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister listened to his backbenchers who identified many of the problems encountered under existing legislation.  Indeed, people will now find it more difficult to claim benefits under this legislation.  Deputies, who represent urban and rural constituencies, have identified anomalies in this system. Indeed, we could spend the night outlining the problems in the medical referee system and means-testing which is a source of concern to Members on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the Bill is unconstitutional. One of its little known provisions will remove an established benefit from those who have paid for it.  Under section 32 people who become ill or are hospitalised while in receipt of unemployment benefit will no longer be entitled to claim disability benefit, even though this is a right they always enjoyed. The same will apply in the case of those who become sick in the first year of work after a period of unemployment.</P>
      <P>This measure will be trumpeted by the Government as a way of combating abuse but the Government have mechanisms at their disposal, principally the medical referee system which has been identified by Deputy Dukes, and others, as a merry-go-round. This measure is simply a crude attack on a well established benefit and the principal purpose in making this attack is to transfer the cost from the Government to the person who is sick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill contains measures which were not announced in the budget.  For example, those in receipt of unemployment assistance who manage to get an occasional day's work will lose one pound in unemployment assistance for every pound they earn.  The introduction of means-testing for the long term unemployed <Col N="1443" /> will mean a tightening of the poverty net around those on the lowest income levels in the State.  Up until now income from insurable employment, that is, where PRSI contributions were paid, was not counted as means for unemployment assistance claimants.  As a result, claimants could take up an occasional day's employment, sign off for the day and benefit from the day's wages.</P>
    <P>A single person now signing off for one day would lose £9.10 in unemployment assistance and any earnings above that were, to all intents and purposes, the incentive for him to get work for that day.  Under the provisions of this Bill not only would he be unable to claim for that day but he would lose £1 for every £1 earned.  This provision will reinforce the barrier between those at work and those excluded from work, and there are almost 3,000 people here excluded from work.  The person in work can supplement his income by taking on Saturday employment and part-time jobs but the unemployed person under this Bill would have to turn down a Saturday job, because every penny earned on the Saturday job would be taken from the dole.</P>
    <P>A third provision in the Bill which represents the introduction of means testing in respect of unemployment benefit relates to redundancy payments.  Unemployment benefit, because it is directly related to insurance contributions, has never been regarded as appropriate for means testing, but now workers who accept redundancy payments above a limit which is still to be set, will not receive unemployment benefit for the first nine weeks during which they are out of work.  Also this nine weeks will not be added on at the end of the claim. It will be deducted from the 15 months that would normally apply in a claim.</P>
    <P>We do not support the shedding of viable jobs and the use of the social welfare system to subsidise this, but this problem may be better dealt with through <Col N="1444" /> taxation or by the Department of Labour.  The proposed approach is a crude measure which will hit those whose jobs were taken away from them as well as those who accepted voluntary redundancy. These measures will add to the means testing about which we already know.  Means testing will apply even to deserted wife's benefit.  In the past a deserted wife would benefit from her husband's contributions.  We have now been told that deserted wife's benefit will be taken away from any woman who earns more than £12,000 a year.  There will be a provision in this Bill to set an earnings ceiling which could be a great deal lower than the £12,000 now being talked about.</P>
    <P>In general terms, this Bill poses a threat to the concept of the insurance-based social welfare system.  The introduction of means testing through the back door, coupled with the other cuts in benefits and the reduced access to benefits, constitutes the most fundamental attack on social welfare that could be contemplated, even by the most right-wing Government in this State.  That is why the Labour Party will oppose this Bill at every stage.  We will oppose it on Second Stage and we will oppose as many amendments as this Government will allow us to contest.  We are sorry that the Minister with his flair has been saddled with this legislation.  We know the Minister is not responsible for most of it but that he now has to carry the can, and it is a can of worms.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  The Bill and the Minister's statement introducing it are depressing.  The provisions of the Bill are depressing for anyone depending on <Col N="1445" /> or likely to become dependent on social welfare in the foreseeable future.  This Bill and the Minister's statement reflect the Government's inability to come to grips with unemployment.  The Minister in his statement said &ldquo;come hell or high water&rdquo;.  For the unemployed that time has already arrived &mdash; the water is getting higher and hell is getting hotter for them as time goes on.  The Minister's recipe for dealing with the matter attacks the entitlement of unemployed people who have already suffered the severe indignity of losing their jobs with little prospect, if any, of getting other jobs.  There have been references now to misuse and abuse of the system and people who have paid tax throughout their lives for 20, 30 or 40 years have been put under a shadow. They are referred to as recipients and other people are referred to as taxpayers. I will remind the Minister and the Government that social welfare recipients are taxpayers and to attempt to divide our citizens into two categories, as the Minister did in his speech, is deplorable. Most of the people on unemployment payments paid tax throughout their lives.  These people have suffered job losses and now they will lose the entitlements for which they more than handsomely contributed.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the complexity of the social welfare system and said that he wished to simplify it.  Then he went on to make it doubly complex. As a result of this Bill we will have three different codes under the welfare system. One category of claimants will be dealt with under one set of rules, another category will have their payments dealt with under a set of rules established in the past three or four years, and now there will be a new set of rules for claimants entering the system from April on or whatever date is fixed in this Bill.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare there was one set of rules for everybody and now there are three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures in this Bill do not encourage enterprise nor do they enable people <Col N="1446" /> to improve their circumstances.  I had some people to see me recently, whose employer was cutting back on employment. The employer wanted to keep everyone employed part-time and the workers agreed to it.  The provisions in this Bill knocked that on the head.  The employer will now have to close down altogether.  Similarly, a person is compelled to be unemployed for over 12 months in order to be considered for the part-time scheme of assistance.  One is compelled to become unemployed in order to avail oneself of some of the provisions.</P>
    <P>The shock of losing employment is certainly severe but the shock of a husband's death is far worse.  Until some years ago it was the practice of the Department to allow the free scheme to run for a number of months if the widow was under the age of 66.  This has been tightened up in recent years.  I had a case recently where a woman returned from burying her husband to find that the postman had delivered a letter indicating that the free electricity allowance and free telephone rental were to be discontinued.  The Minister may not be able to bring in a scheme to provide that widows of recipients of these benefits should continue to benefit until the age of 66, but I would appeal to him to allow widows to continue to receive these benefits for a year or so after the death of their husbands.  The benefits have been budgeted for and the Minister would be doing a great act of mercy if he could allow this cushioning period.  Widows lose the main part of the pension which their husbands received and qualify for a lesser amount.  To lose in addition the benefit of these schemes is a very severe blow.  There are two kinds of widows.  There are those who are dependent on their husbands' contributory pensions because they would not qualify in their own right for non-contributory pensions due to other means.  Where the widow is worse off and qualifies for a non-contributory pension, she does not get payment for six weeks <Col N="1447" /> following the death of her husband.  It is very difficult to explain why people in poorer circumstances are not facilitated in this way.  Very small amounts of money are involved in rectifying these matters. I would appeal to the Minister not to cut off the benefits of the free schemes in the brutal fashion which is being practised currently.</P>
    <P>I condemn the use of the term &ldquo;voluntary redundancy.&rdquo;  It is a misnomer and a contradiction in itself.  When a firm decide to let 20 people go, they will look for volunteers; if they do not get them, people will be made compulsorily redundant. We see on television the anguish of those in the west who are losing their jobs in the meat industry.  To target further such people is beyond my understanding. People nowadays have heavy mortgages and heavy repayments on cars which are essential if they are to remain in the labour market.  Just because they get a redundancy payment of £10,000 or £20,000 &mdash; one year's salary &mdash; with perhaps 20 years unemployment ahead of them, the Minister and the Government believe they should be deprived of unemployment benefit.  I cannot understand the thinking behind that kind of savage attack on people who are on their knees. To kick people when they are down is the worst form of attack.  That is what some of these measures amount to and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also decided to cut back on occupational injury benefit.  I was a Member of this House in the early sixties when a high powered commission were asked to investigate an alternative to the Workman's Compensation Act. The commission, consisting of members of the Congress of Trade Unions and employers, decided in their wisdom after much deliberation that there should be a higher payment of compensation for people out of work due to accidents at work.  I question the Minister's wisdom in deciding that the payments should be the same, against the decision of many <Col N="1448" /> years ago that they should be different.  I wonder if the Minister has consulted the community welfare officers whose workload will increase twofold or more due to the fact that the long term unemplyed will not qualify for disability benefit. They will have an enormous workload and I expect they will have something to say about it in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House, I will share my time, as agreed, with Deputy Callely.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his very onerous portfolio.  Based on the facts that the Minister presented, it is particularly challenging.  He highlighted that we in this small country will spend this year £3.36 billion on social welfare and £940 million on unemployment payments.  I do not intend to go into the intricacies of the various schemes under the Department of Social Welfare.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he proposes to bring forward before the end of the year a consolidation Bill, which is long overdue. There is certainly duplication of various schemes and there is need for consolidation and rationalisation.  I have no doubt that the Minister will tackle this problem, thereby reducing overheads and administrative costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after taking office the Minister visited the community of Rowlagh, north Clondalkin, in my constituency.  I did not have the opportunity of being there on that day but I compliment him on that visit as a result of which he has first hand knowledge of the area.  A group of women in north Clondalkin called the Rowlagh Women's Development Group, under a tutor from St. Patrick's College in Maynooth, prepared a document on aspects of poverty in the area.  In that report, which is available to the Department of Social Welfare, they refer to the link between poverty and unemployment. In their introduction they stated: &ldquo;We chose to do this project because we live in what is described as a &ldquo;Disadvantaged Area&rdquo;, an area highly <Col N="1449" /> populated and with 70 per cent to 80 per cent long term unemployed.&rdquo;  This community is what Dublin County Council would term a `codan' area, an area where limited community investment is directed towards the areas that most need it.  The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>In many households Unemployment Assistance is the only income.  Some children may suffer from a deprived environment.  They get little or no encouragement and have little to motivate them, therefore, to some of these the world of employment is somewhere they may never reach.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Urban Affairs was set up as a result of difficulties experienced in this community in north Clondalkin.  I would emphasise the need for monitoring the workings of that task force on which the Department of Social Welfare are represented and whose report on north Clondalkin is due in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is essential that this task force consider the various schemes on unemployment. The Department of Social Welfare, FÁS, local authorities, the SES, Youthreach and other bodies carry out great work within communities, but there is need for co-ordination in this area.  The Department are spending up to £1 billion on unemployment and, considering the investment by FÁS, the IDA and other Departments, the amount spent on unemployment amounts to up to £5 billion. Much of the activity in the job creation area could be initiated by the Department of Social Welfare.  No other Department have at their fingertips the detailed information necessary to put forward suggestions and recommendations as to how this horrendous problem can be tackled.  I welcome the Minister's approach to this task.  He can play a key role at the Cabinet table in solving the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for co-ordination of the various schemes introduced by Government Departments.  The Department of Social Welfare have a decisive <Col N="1450" /> role in regard to unemployment.  I strongly urge that they monitor the work of the Task Force on Urban Affairs and ensure that some of the recommendations in the report on the north Clondalkin area are implemented.  A redirection of resources is needed to overcome the effects of unemployment and to prevent a further deterioration of communities.  Greater co-ordination is needed between the Department of Education, the Department of Health, the Department of the Environment and the local authorities in tackling the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister ask his Department to meet with senior management of the local authorities to ascertain whether a substantial number of unemployed people could be given productive employment.  Much work is carried out by people on FÁS schemes, work experience schemes, environmental improvement schemes and so on, but these schemes should be streamlined with a view to providing permanent employment. I would urge that the Department monitor the Task Force on Urban Affairs and ensure that the money spent in this area is put to better use.</P>

      <P>First I would like to congratulate Deputy McCreevy on his recent appointment as Minister for Social Welfare. Most people recognise that he will make a very good Minister.  This is the first Social Welfare Bill introduced by this Minister and I am happy to support it.  As has been highlighted, increases are given across the board to social welfare recipients.  Total expenditure for 1992 is in excess of £3.36 billion.  In the difficult financial circumstances this shows Fianna Fáil's continued commitment and caring approach to the less well off in society. However, one would have to express concern at the amount of money spent on <Col N="1451" /> unemployment payments in 1992 &mdash; in excess of £940 million.  The Government are tackling this problem by proposing the setting up of a jobs forum.  All parties in the House need to address sincerely the greatest problem faced by this country, unemployment.  I have a particular interest in the large number of young people who are unemployed and are becoming disillusioned with our system, and in those who, unfortunately, have to look abroad to try to find some kind of employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments that he intends to examine further ways of creating incentives for the unemployed to take up unemployment or to become self-employed while in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I look forward to the Minister making further announcements and giving details of developments in that regard during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies have raised the issue of the invalidity pension and the disability benefit.  The time of many public representatives, let alone the time of the Department of Social Welfare and that of medical referees, is taken up by the appeals system for disability benefit.  The fault of the system seems to be that there is no higher authority that can settle a case once and for all.  Instead, we have a system of ongoing appeals.  Many of my constituents who have been knocked off disability benefit have appealed that decision, have gone before a medical referee and have been completely unsatisfied with the examination carried out by the medical referee.  I have come across cases of individuals who have merely sat before a medical referee and answered several questions before being knocked off disability benefit.  They have come to me and shown written medical evidence indicating the severity of an illness and giving reasons for inability to work. However, a medical referee who has not examined the individual at all declares them fit for work.  The whole question of disability benefit, the appeals system and <Col N="1452" /> the manner in which appeals are carried out have to be considered more caringly.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance was introduced with very good intentions.  I understand that the present Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will be considering this allowance in greater detail.  This benefit has great potential but since its introduction that potential has not been achieved. When considering different aspects relating to the supplementary and subvention payments made to individuals who require long term nursing care by health boards and the payments made to carers, one realises that there is a huge potential for development of the carer's allowance. In certain instances health boards pay up to £200 and purchase beds from private nursing homes to care for those who require long term nursing care, yet at the same time there is insufficient assistance for relatives or family members who are prepared to provide that care.  The criteria for benefit from the carer's allowance and the payment of that allowance are matters that must be examined more closely.</P>
    <P>I am greatly encouraged by section 41, which concerns the relationship between the Department of Social Welfare and An Post.  I welcome the Minister's intention to develop and consider further possibilities for development.  There is great scope in that area.</P>
    <P>As regards the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, I also welcome the Minister's intention to achieve greater standardisation between the health boards.  There is great concern about this issue in the area of Dublin that I represent. Some of my constituents have told me that there can be a great difference in one's payments depending on the supplementary welfare officer involved. Having said that, I also highly commend and support all supplementary welfare officers, who do an extremely good job in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that he would like to witness greater efficiency in expenditure in various sectors involved <Col N="1453" /> in the delivery of services.  I do have some concerns.  Following the decentralisation programme that has been carried out, when elderly people inquire about old age pension entitlements, etc., they are told to phone the Sligo office; when they make inquiries about a free travel allowance they are advised to phone a different office, and so on.  Social welfare services are widely spread.  The SW4 booklet issued by the Department of Social Welfare is very detailed and informative. However, the public find the position complex because here are many informative documents issued by the Department, ranging from weekly rates to facts sheets.  I congratulate organisations such as the National Social Services Board, who issue excellent brochures about entitlements for pensioners and over-sixties. I also congratulate other community-orientated groups on issuing publications such as the Donnycarney Parish Directory in Coolock.  Such informative booklets on social welfare entitlements are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Minister consider the appointment of a co-ordinator for social welfare voluntary services on a parochial or a Dáil constituency basis.  A co-ordinator could give people information on their entitlements as required.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <P>(4)  that the dates specified for the small increases in the rates of social welfare payments are the latest ever and represent a six month gap between the budget announcement and the implementation of the increases,</P>
    <P>(5)  that the Bill has already met with strong criticism from trade unions, employer organisations and groups concerned with the interests of those on social welfare,</P>
    <P>declines to give a Second Reading to the Social Welfare Bill, 1992.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for co-operating with the allocation of time.  I intend to share my time with Deputies Garland and McCormack.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill is one of the most significant measures to be published in recent years, but unfortunately, it is significant for all of the wrong reasons. The Bill represents a fundamental change in the direction of public policy on social welfare.  In fact, it is an outright assault on the principle of an assurance-based social welfare system and a complete rejection of the approach urged by the famous Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the first real measure of the intentions of the new Government and the new Minister for Social Welfare. Quite frankly, the indications are alarming. Perhaps we should have been warned by the Taoiseach's speech to the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, in which the poor were ignored and social welfare was mentioned only in the context of a so-called disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>This Bill must rank as the most disturbing Social Welfare Bill in recent years.  The public statements made by the recently appointed Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to the effect that the proposed <Col N="1455" /> changes in the Bill result from an abuse of various schemes by welfare recipients is dishonest and, by being divisive is a cheap way of trying to engender support for the huge and varying degrees of cutbacks proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill throws into sharp focus the worthlessness and betrayal of the social partners of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which referred to the Government being committed to an ongoing programme for reform of the social welfare system broadly within the framework outline by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I contend its provisions will do absolutely nothing in that direction. Rather they will introduce loathsome means testing into the social insurance arena; they will introduce the same degrading, unfair means testing into the system as applies to social assistance schemes and medical cards.  It introduces this terrible means testing into social insurance schemes where it had no place until the recently appointed Minister took office.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents the first sledgehammer blow of the new Minister at the concept of a pay-related social insurance system which will be sufficiently damaging to undermine it in the eyes of both employers and employees.  I predict it will weaken the system to the extent that there will be a backlash by way of lack of confidence in social insurance which could ultimately kill it off.</P>
    <P>Let nobody mistake the Minister's aims.  He is attacking PAYE workers and attempting to kill social insurance, on the one hand, by increasing by £1,000 the ceiling beyond which PRSI contributions are compulsory on the part of PAYE workers, bringing the figure to £19,000, while, on the other hand, robbing them of their benefits and entitlements.  Why should any PAYE worker feel happy to have 7.75 per cent of his income deducted up to a ceiling of £19,000 in respect of social insurance, health and the employment-training levy?  Why should he feel <Col N="1456" /> happy when he is asked to pay more social insurance while at the same time his entitlements are being reduced under the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    <P>Why should thousands of wives of insured workers, earning in excess of £25,000 annually, be deprived of their optical and dental benefits, a change which in itself constitutes an outrageous attack on women's rights?  If the Minister is allowed to get away with his plans the next logical attack will be to deprive women, those whose husbands earn in excess of £25,000 annually, of child benefit. Indeed, if the Minister is allowed to continue on that path the next logical step would be for him to means-test recipients of contributory old age pensions which would mean in turn, that many an old aged pensioner would end up receiving no pension at all, even after a lifetime of paying his or her PRSI contributions. That is the path the Minister is taking.  He is undermining social insurance by introducing this terrible means-testing system.  For example, widows in receipt of contributory widow's pension will no longer be assured of their pensions under this new direction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It begs the question: why has the Minister begun this outrageous, demeaning, loathsome means testing by targeting so many women?  Why has he specifically targeted unfortunate women who have been deserted by their husbands, by means testing them on incomes in excess of £12,000 annually?  Is the Minister aware that those few deserted wives earning, say £12,000 annually, who are in receipt of the deserted wife's benefit, more than likely will repay 50 per cent of that benefit to the Exchequer in tax?</P>
    <P>Let us revert to the Government bible &mdash; the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; and remind ourselves what is said in it about social welfare.  It speaks of greater flexibility being necessary within social welfare schemes to encourage and facilitate more people to regain a foothold in the labour market. <Col N="1457" /> Honourable words and sentiments. Having agreed to recognise the need for flexibility and to facilitate people in regaining a foothold in the labour market, let us examine how the Minister will achieve that goal.  For example, the explanatory memorandum, under the heading Unemployment Payment schemes states:</P>
    <P>Unemployment Assistance</P>
    <P>Section 27 replaces the Unemployment Assistance chapter of the Social Welfare Acts and contains a number of amendments relating to the Unemployment Assistance scheme. The purpose of the amendment is to&mdash; . . . .</P>
    <P>&mdash;provide that where a person has earnings from insurable employment but claims unemployment assistance, his earnings will be assessed as means in determining his entitlement to Unemployment Assistance;</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that that is some way of giving a fellow a leg-up and-or returning him to the labour market.  The Minister could not have devised a more rigid, inflexible approach to encouraging and facilitating more people to regain a foothold in the labour market than he has under the provisions of section 27.  I predict its provisions will act as a total deterrent to people actively endeavouring to re-enter the labour market or, indeed, those endeavouring to enter the labour market for the first time.  It will be a slap in the face to an unemployed, qualified teacher who may be offered a day's work in the local technical college or school.  Why should such people want to sign off unemployment assistance for the day and ultimately not just losing their £9.10 daily rate &mdash; or whatever it is &mdash; but having themselves means tested for eligibility for such assistance if they accept the offer of a second day or night's work in the week.  Does the Minister not appreciate what will be the effect of the provisions of section 146 (f) on such people, when not alone will their unemployment <Col N="1458" /> assistance be put in jeopardy but also their rights to a medical card or to a rent supplement, if they are in receipt of these.</P>
    <P>It would be a worthwhile exercise for the Minister to read the submission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, contained in their excellent submission entitled &ldquo;A Question of Choices&rdquo;, where they say the Government should eliminate the barriers that currently block unemployed people from working when jobs do not exist.  The Minister is doing the exact opposite, he is erecting barriers.  It is interesting to note that the INOU, who should know all about barriers and unemployment, have highlighted four areas of the Minister's Bill which they find very disturbing.  They say that despite constant Government references to removing poverty traps the provisions of this Bill will render it much more difficult for unemployed people to take up work, reinforcing the barriers obtaining between those with work and those without work; that while a wide range of obnoxious and mean provisions are encompassed in this Bill the following four will have an immediate, negative impact on the unemployed.  The first is the means testing of work undertaken by people on unemployment assistance, to which I referred.  That most serious attack was not even announced in the budget and never referred to by the Minister prior to the publication of this Bill.  This new provision will mean that people on unemployment assistance who manage to obtain an occasional day's work in the white economy will lose £1 for every £1 they earn, whereas, to date income from insurable employment was not counted in the case of claimants for unemployment assistance.  That meant such claimants could avail of an occasional day's employment in the official economy, sign off for the day and benefit from those earnings.</P>

      <P>One would need an hour at least to comment on the provisions of this Bill.  I will make one final reference to some sentiments expressed by the Minister in the course of his introductory remarks today when he said that social welfare was complex and he was concerned about it.  I say to him he has rendered it doubly complex in that the proposed new means testing, involving community welfare officers, will necessitate an army of bureaucrats to administer the changes, in turn leading to more delays for the poor and more appeals being lodged within the appeals system.</P>
      <P>With this, his first Social Welfare Bill, the Minister has managed to turn social welfare legislation from having been complex but workable into a minefield whose victims will be those who, ironically, the British social insurance system &mdash; on which ours has been based &mdash; was designed to protect.  In addition to printing the &ldquo;Guide to Social Welfare Services&rdquo; the Minister should print a similar &ldquo;Guide to Social Welfare Regulations&rdquo; since one without the other will not be of much benefit.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaonas Glas, I have no option but to oppose this Bill.  I will refer briefly to section 27, the provisions of which deal with the manner in which part-time workers are dealt with for the purpose of unemployment assistance.  Henceforth the proposal under which earnings from part time employment will be deducted from unemployment assistance must constitute the most retrograde step ever taken in this House in this respect.  It constitutes a total regression whereas, in the course of his introductory remarks, the Minister pleaded for a consistent approach to the treatement of part-time earnings for the self employed and part time employees.  He is entirely correct in that regard.  The Minister should give <Col N="1460" /> the same treatment to the self-employed as is presently given to part time employees.</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour of providing incentives and encouragement to people to improve their situation and reduce their dependency on the state welfare system.</P>
      <P>This statement is unbelievable and is totally at variance with what the Minister is proposing.  This proposal will add further to the number of dole recipients.  It will also make the lot of these unfortunate people much worse and will discourage people from seeking a day's work here and there.  It is well known that a number of the long term unemployed have managed to re-enter the full-time workforce through such temporary part-time work. Is the Minister trying to put a stop to this small incentive which is of benefit to some of the poorest of our citizens?  Is this the act of a caring Government?</P>
      <P>The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, would like to see the introduction of a basic income scheme to replace social welfare.  This basic income would be paid unconditionally to all citizens - male, female, the unemployed, the self-employed, pensioners, divorcees, separated people, etc.  The only way forward is through such a scheme and not the hodgepodge social welfare system which is being tinkered around with in this Bill.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the co-operation of Deputies in regard to the sharing of time this debate is unsatisfactory in that a number of Deputies who wish to contribute cannot do so.  I am sure the Minister and his officials would have benefited if this debate had been twice as long.  Deputies can give the Minister and his officials the benefit of their first hand experience of the difficulties which arise in the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recurring point made by Deputies on all sides of the House throughout the debate is the apparent unsatisfactory <Col N="1461" /> approach adopted by social welfare officers when examining social welfare applicants.  Deputy Wyse proposed the introduction of a once-off assessment. This would be a logical proposal for the Minister to follow up.  Deputy O'Toole outlined the position in regard to claims by applicants from rural areas.  He has first-hand experience of this.  When he was referring to the social welfare officers who watch through field glasses as women make hay I thought he was going to give us a verse of &ldquo;Galway Bay&rdquo;.  He also referred to the social welfare officers who watch the people who empty lobster cages at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to some cases in Connemara in particular.  People in Connemara grow their vegetables in their front gardens because of the scarcity of soil in their back gardens.  Many social welfare officers remark on these gardens. It is unfair to think that an applicant can be penalised for growing vegetables in a front garden which would be approximately the same size as the carpet on the floor in front of me.  People in Connemara and other areas should be encouraged to grow vegetables in their gardens.  I know of applicants who have been penalised for having carrots growing in their front gardens.  In one case the applicant was quizzed so much by the social welfare officer that she offered to lift a hatching hen off her eggs so that the social welfare officer could count the eggs.  Deputies are aware of the absolute fear applicants have of being questioned by social welfare officers.  This is completely unnecessary.  The Minister has been advised by Members on all sides of the House to have a word with his officials to ensure that applicants are not terrified of being visited by social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>The same system is used in assessing eligibility for a medical card.  Farmers are assessed on the basis of their stock.  The number of stock is multiplied by a magical figure which is supposed to give a farmer's income.  If the figure is above the eligibility level he cannot qualify for a <Col N="1462" /> medical card.  Most social welfare officers do not realise that 30 ewes and five cattle do not give farmers an adequate income. Farmers who say they are not making the amount of money they are estimated to be making are asked why, then, they are in the business.  Farming is a way of life for these people.  Social Welfare officers find it very hard to understand why these people continue to farm if they do not make an adequate income from it.  The point has been made repeatedly throughout the debate that the Minister for Social Welfare should introduce a more humane system for assessing eligibility for social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the case of a person who applied for an old age pension.  This person had accumulated stamps while working for a relative.  However, because they were deemed to be &ldquo;in contract for service&rdquo; rather than having &ldquo;a contract of service&rdquo; they were disqualified from receiving a contributory old age pension. I should like the Minister to clarify what is meant by that kind of jargon.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to the carer's allowance.  This is a potentially valuable scheme which has not been allowed to blossom.  In other words, people who are entitled to a carer's allowance are not getting it because of the provisions laid down in the regulations. People are disqualified from receiving a carer's allowance on the basis of income. For example, a husband and wife whose income is more than £90 are disqualified from receiving this allowance.  This is ridiculous. Many people are disqualified on the basis that they are not full-time carers.  I know a person in south Galway who was caring at home for his two aunts who were bedridden.  He applied for a carer's allowance after the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, announced the scheme to a great fanfare in 1990.  However, this man who has ten cows and 25 ewes was disqualified from receiving this allowance on the basis that he was not a full-time carer.  Yet, this person never left his home, never went <Col N="1463" /> out at night and never socialised as he had to care for his two aunts on a 24 hours a day basis.  Not alone was he disqualified but the social welfare officer took £3 off the old age pension of one of his aunts.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the previous Minister for Social Welfare in regard to a case in Annaghdown.  I raised the matter during the debate on the 1990 budget and he requested me to send him the details. However, this case has still not been solved.  I wrote to the new Minister for Social Welfare about the case on 20 February. I know he has not had time to respond to me yet.  The reference number is 23/5696621N.  The person in this case is caring for a doubly incontinent 57 year old relative at home.  This person was awarded the princely sum of £2 by way of a carer's allowance through caring for their relative 24 hours a day without any respite whatsoever.  Those are just some examples of such cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have examined the case which the carers' association made in regard to the removal of the means test clause from the carer and the person being cared for.  If the carer is married and in receipt of social welfare benefits he &mdash; or she &mdash; will receive the full £45 but will lose an adult dependant allowance of £31.  A couple whose joint income is more than £90 will not qualify. Elderly people should also retain their entitlements to ESB allowance and a free television licence in the event of them moving to live with the carer.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who participated so well in this debate.  We ran the gamut of speeches, from witty to heartrending, about some aspects of the social welfare system. <Col N="1464" /> Whatever about the proposals of the Government and the Opposition in relation to a jobs forum perhaps the next time there is a Commission on Social Welfare, the investigating officers should take the Members' views on board.  I was a backbencher for a long time and the majority of cases about which I received inquiries were in relation to social welfare.

      <P>Deputy Dukes advised me not to become too immersed in the system and I intend to take his advice. The danger is that one could get so involved in all the schemes, regulations and qualifying conditions that one could not see the overall picture.  Coming from an accountancy background, I could become very involved in detailed information and become quite expert over a period, although it would probably take a lifetime.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is now a centre in Trinity College, Dublin, giving information in relation to social welfare.  As I said recently, I can visualise contestants on &ldquo;Mastermind&rdquo; in years to come being asked questions about our social welfare system and not getting them right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare system reminds me of the taxation system.  I am sure that if we were now putting a tax system in place we would not have many of the reliefs which are in place at present.  Over the years people made a case regarding mortgage interest reliefs and so on and, if they are changed, they create other anomalies. The Department of Social Welfare legislation reminds me of the Frank Kelly tape which I play on the car radio. He tells the story of a man walking near Kilcock who stopped to ask the way to Mullingar.  He was directed through Kilcock, <Col N="1465" /> Rathangan and the Curragh and, after about three weeks, the traveller arrived back in Kilcock.  He asked the person who had given him directions why he had sent him on such a roundabout journey as it was not the direct route to Mullingar.  The man replied that if he had been going to Mullingar he would not have started from Kilcock in the first place.  It is the same with the social welfare system, if we were starting from scratch now we would probably not have all the schemes which are in place at present.  The problem is, as other Deputies have pointed out, that when one tries to get rid of an anomaly in one area, anomalies are created in other areas.</P>
    <P>Perhaps politicians want to be liked but it seems that every Minister for Social Welfare wanted a scheme called after him before he left office.  We now have books containing schemes and qualifying conditions, there are numerous investigating officers, compliance officers, deciding officers and referees of all shapes and sizes.  It is an industry.  The schemes are like those introduced in other areas, they were introduced for a specific purpose and they were a good idea at the time.  However, they seemed to take on an organic growth of their own over a period and that also happened in relation to the Department of Social Welfare.  If one was too closely involved with all the schemes, not alone would one not see the wood for the trees, one would not even see the sea or the sky, one would be buried in certain areas of the Department.</P>
    <P>I will not be able to deal with all the points raised by Deputies.  I hope that a consolidation Bill will simplify some of the rules and regulations and bring them up to date.  I hope to introduce that Bill towards the end of the year.  If the system was simpler it would be easier to comply with, easier to administer and it would tackle abuse because there would not be an incentive to abuse the system.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in a short period of <Col N="1466" /> Government to solve all the problems at one fell swoop but during my period in office &mdash; no matter how long or short it may be; that is a matter for the electorate and other factors &mdash; I will endeavour to do my best.  During my short period as Minister I have made many speeches about disincentives.  One scheme which epitomises how crazy the welfare system has become is the family income supplement scheme.  It is a good scheme and works effectively but it means that we must give money to people who are working to bring them up to a level which they would reach if they were not working. The scheme encapsulates where we have gone wrong over the years.  It means that people who are working will not be worse off if they are not working.</P>
    <P>Most of the proposed changes would cost money but, if possible, I will look at the problems of widows who are not entitled to benefits when their husbands die.  A number of Deputies made the point that they are cut off immediately and that it would not apply if the husband had been a contributory pensioner.  I do not want to be remembered as the Minister who introduced many new schemes but I should like to be remembered as someone who treated widows fairly in relation to social welfare.  My concern probably stems from the fact that my mother was widowed very young.  I was the eldest of the family and, luckily, due to my father's employment with a State organisation, my mother qualified for a widow's contributory pension.  Small as it was, it was a regular income and it made a difference.  I never expected to be in Government or in the Department of Social Welfare but I always said that if I was I would try to do something in that regard.  I hope, in future, to do something about this matter.</P>
    <P>Some Members suggested that there have been exaggerated comments in relation to some of the Bill's provisions and said I was attacking the whole principle of pay-related social insurance. There is no point in fooling ourselves <Col N="1467" /> about these things because the theory of the earnings related scheme is an excellent one.  The theory behind the earnings-related automatic entitlement to income scheme is excellent when things are going well in the country but there is very little relationship between what is paid into the scheme and what is taken out of it. Some people pay a great deal into the system and get nothing out of it at all but others pay very little and get a great deal. The State makes a very large subvention to the social insurance fund.  There is no point in saying that the scheme is self-financing, because it is not.  With the rising number of unemployed people and the annual increases in benefits, the cost of the social welfare system to the State is such that funding the present rate of payments is becoming very difficult.  In addition, the demographic trend is towards a worsening of the present high dependency ratio in the years to come. That is a fact.  Unless we begin to target resources to areas of need, a future Government Minister for Social Welfare will have grave difficulty in funding the system.  I am not trying to do away with the theory of a pay-related social insurance system but it is only honest to point out as some Deputies have already done, that some provisions in the Bill remove automatic entitlement.  We have also set income limits.  I am not trying to fool anybody, but it is unfair to exaggerate what I have done and to say I am trying to dismantle the pay-related system.  I am not.  I am trying only to grapple with a system which is costing the State a great deal of money.  I do not like a means test no more than anybody else but with the increasing numbers, if we are to target benefit to those who really need it we have to make changes.  The changes proposed in the Bill are quite modest.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the simplification of the social welfare system.  Deputy Wyse among others stressed the need for a unified means test <Col N="1468" /> not only for all social welfare payments but all State benefits so that the same test will be applied by the health boards, and by local authorities in assessing eligibility for education grants, etc.  As has been pointed out, there are different means tests for different categories of recipients. It is hard to justify different means tests, and I accept that.  I have initiated steps &mdash; and a study into this area has been ongoing for some time &mdash; to bring uniformity to the system but we should remember that if we are going to have a uniform means test, it will depend on the basis from which we start.  We have to make a decision whether to raise the threshold for means test to the highest existing level or lower it to the lowest existing level or to bring some categories up and others down.  There will be winners and losers, because any additional costs in one area will have to be met out of the total social welfare budget.</P>

      <P>As Deputies have rightly pointed out, the number of unemployed persons is increasing.  There is no point in saying that I will be able to do something that will cost money when I will not be able to raise that money. While I will try to establish a uniform means test in the Department, I must point out that there will be both winners and losers because I will not be able to raise the threshold in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great need to simplify the system.  A good idea is that a person will have a unique identification number for all their dealings with the State.  As Members know, the Department of Social Welfare have taken over responsibility for the allocation of RSI numbers. If this were applied universally we could make the system more comprehensive. Some people objected to being asked if they were in receipt of child benefit when we asked for their RSI number.  The theory of a universal number is that it would apply to all areas in the Department <Col N="1469" /> of Social Welfare.  As some Deputies rightly pointed out, the supplementary welfare allowance from the community welfare officer is administered by the health board but paid for by the Department of Social Welfare and there is not a tie-up between the two areas.</P>
    <P>A great many Members commented on the restriction of unemployment benefit to people in receipt of a certain level of redundancy payment.  This has caused some controversy.  Deputy Bell among others was very kind to me and I thank him for that.  Perhaps it was because this was the first Bill I introduced in the House that he was nicer than he would normally be; I do not think people are nice to me because of the way I comb my hair.  I have a tough skin so I do not expect people to be nice to me all the time and I take no offence if they are not nice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bell's arguments made a lot of sense to me but he made the point that this measure would mean that we would return to the last in first out &mdash; LIFO &mdash; system of redundancy. I thought about this point but I do not honestly believe that will be the situation.  The Bill provides that this will not apply to people over the age of 55 years.  There were various options on the table.  I have not prescribed the amount of the redundancy payment because I want to negotiate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with the Federation of Irish Employers before I decide on a level.  That is why the provision has been couched in those terms.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That will give me the opportunity to meet those people before I set a figure.  No figure is mentioned in <Col N="1470" /> the Bill and I state that the amount is to be prescribed in regulation, and before we decide on the amount in the regulations I will have negotiations with the relevant bodies.  That should get us over that particular problem.</P>
      <P>We have extended the disqualification period to nine weeks in the case of redundancy. We do not talk about voluntary or involuntary redundancy because, as Deputy Séamus Pattison said, voluntary redundancy is a misnomer because it is a total contradiction in terms.  We refer to a payment to be prescribed in regulations and after discussing the matter with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers we could come up with the figure.  It has emerged beyond doubt that both employers and trade unions connive in the situation. They use the Department of Social Welfare as a prop-up mechanism and advertise how employees will benefit under the provisions of the Department of Social Welfare.  That was never the intention of what a social insurance system should be. In my view social insurance is a contingency measure so that if people are unemployed or sick, or whatever the case may be, the State welfare system will look after them.</P>

      <P>There is something in what the Deputy says, but I will return to that point later because I accept there has been a change in work patterns.  It is a broader issue than the Department of Social Welfare in that I do not believe that is what the social insurance system is meant to be.  The proposal I made is reasonable and I hope the regulations being prescribed with a fixed amount will cater for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton recently raised the matter of child benefit by means of a Dáil question.  There is no increase under this Bill for child benefit, or children's <Col N="1471" /> allowance as it used to be called.  The general increase of 4 per cent applicable to recipients on weekly rates of social welfare does apply to the child dependant allowance payable as an increase in those weekly payments.  This is not the first year in which there has been no direct increase in child benefit.  I have thought about the matter of disincentives in the few weeks I have been in the Department. I cannot pre-empt what will be in the next budget but there are studies to prove that there are disincentive effects for people in receipt of social welfare who have a number of children.  With increases in the adult dependant allowance and the child dependant allowance the poverty trap, or the disincentive trap, is applicable to many of those people.  It would be better to target child benefit directly through the child benefit scheme and make it payable to the mother.  I am not going to give any hostage to fortune here this evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If that is the case, one could target more money to the mothers who would spend it more effectively but it has implications which other Deputies have raised.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we are going to increase the weekly rates for social welfare payments and increase child dependant allowance we are prevented from increasing child benefit.  People should be conscious of that issue.  There was much comment concerning farmers being means tested, particularly from Deputies Boylan, O'Toole and McCormack.  I missed some of Deputy O'Toole's contribution because I had to have a break but he entertained us and he also invited me to the west.</P>

      <P>The idea of the means test is to try to establish on a factual basis the real income gross income less expenses &mdash; from the farm.  I would hope to reduce the amount of time spent on means testing and to free up the staff to tackle some other areas.  Perhaps we are making a case for more self-assessment in this regard.  Since we have gone down the road of self-assessment in regard to income tax I see nothing wrong, in principle at least, in gains down that road in this area also.  If farmers can be self-assessed for social welfare purposes it would also mean that penalties would be increased for people who abuse the system.  We may go down that road.</P>
      <P>Some of the ideas put forward by Deputy O'Toole and others were enlightening.  In the sixties the late John Healy used write the &ldquo;Backbencher&rdquo; column.  I used be fascinated by the fact that hens were hidden from the social welfare officer.  Over the years he made the point that farmers' dole should never have been called by that name; he preferred to see it as an incentive to live on the land and perhaps he was right.  I learned over the years that he was more right than anybody else who was talking about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the carer's allowance. Whatever about giving any hostages to fortune in the future I do not want to go back over things which happened in the past.  The principle of a carer's allowance is an excellent one if one looks at it in a <Col N="1473" /> broader context.  When a carer's allowance was announced, both inside and outside the House, I thought that the State would be saved a great deal of money if people were given some money to look after old people at home rather than have them in homes and hospitals.  That is what a carer's allowance should do.  Perhaps it was a good idea to get the principle in the door but I accept that its application is a long way removed from the high principles I have outlined.  When it was introduced it replaced the allowance for a prescribed relative.</P>
    <P>I think my Department should either abandon the carer's allowance, transfer it to the Department of Health &mdash; where it should have been in the first place &mdash; or else the State should take a certain amount from each Department and set up a proper carer's allowance.  That would be more up front.  Any economist would say it is better to give the person at home £50 a week rather than have them in a home and being paid for by the State, at a cost of approximately a couple of hundred pounds per week or, if the person has sufficient means, to have them in private homes.  This is one of the growth industries in Irish life.  Because of the high dependency ratio and people living longer, this is one area in which there will be greater demands in the years to come.  In that regard and having established that principle before I ever came to the Department, I have initiated some informal contacts with my colleague, the Minister for Health, on those broad principles. The idea is to make the carer's allowance more accessible.  Either we transfer the carer's allowance to the Department of Health and have a proper carer's allowance or abandon it completely. Every Deputy, whether he is from Kildare, Galway or Leitrim, has had more trouble explaining the carer's allowance than any other allowance. When the carer's allowance was announced initially in 1990 I could not explain it to anybody.</P>

      <P>The reason we have put an income limit on treatment benefit is that I and my Department calculate it will affect a very small number of people. We estimate that less than 4 per cent &mdash; 18,000 people &mdash; of the total number applying for the treatment benefit of £150,000 will be affected.  It is against the principle of automatic entitlement of which I spoke earlier.  On the other hand, an employee does not pay PRSI above a certain level.  We will try to ensure in the regulations that the effect will not be too bad but I am prepared to defend this principle.  We are on the point of resolving the long running dental dispute which has affected many people.  I think the Irish Dental Association will agree to the new contract which has been put forward. they are balloting their members and I am hopeful they will accept it.  That would be a positive step.  The income limit proposed is reasonable and I am prepared to defend it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this question on the Adjournment.  It relates to a matter which has concerned many people.  I wish to emphasise to the Minister the great need to appoint a body such as the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  Unfortunately, that body was not reappointed and the public do not have any means of expressing their views or lodging a complaint about any broadcasting matter.  In the UK and in other European countries there are more effective bodies than the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, such as the Press Council.  Will the Minister consider establishing such a body here as it has worked well in the UK and in other European countries?</P>
      <P>I was prompted to raise this matter by an RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on 10 March which accused, tried and judged a private citizen.  The programme was in despicably bad taste.  RTE apparently sent a crew to Orlando at great cost and not only that but they sought out a young lady there and interviewed her at, perhaps, a considerable fee.  The programme infringed on a private family.  It must have been a nightmare for the family concerned who may have looked at that programme.  The programme sought to be sensational and descended to what I would describe as the level of the gutter press.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the public it is vital to have a watchdog such as the Broadcasting Complaints Commission or a Press Council.  The media have gone overboard not just in this instance but in many other cases.  I will not go into detail but there have been instances of a similar nature which have impinged on the privacy of private individuals.  I appreciate that it is important that the media should have freedom of expression but it is equally important that justice and respect be afforded to the citizen.  In this respect it is important that some means be devised and I recommend the appointment of a press council.</P>
      <P>This is my first opportunity in the House to congratulate the Minister on her appointment.  I know she will be a very efficient Minister and I wish her every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to make it absolutely clear that I have no statutory function in relation to programming matters in RTE or the day-to-day running of the organisation and I do not intend to make any comment on the content of any particular programme.  I should like, however, to draw the attention of the House to a statement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 14 March last in which one RTE spokesperson is on record as saying that the board had agreed &ldquo;that the item was in poor taste and the decision to transmit it was regretted&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should also like to make clear that the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1979, lay down specific obligations on the RTE Authority in relation in particular to the broadcasting of news and the broadcast treatment of current affairs.  I refer Deputy Brady to section 18 (1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, as amended by section 3 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976. Statutory responsibility for ensuring compliance with these provisions rests solely with the Authority.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy's contention that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission is the only vehicle available to deal with complaints from the public regarding broadcasting standards.  The first and primary place to lodge complaints of this nature is the RTE Authority. I would expect the Authority to give proper consideration to all complaints received in relation to programming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In setting up the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, the legislation recognised the primary role of the RTE Authority in this area.  The first step in invoking the complaints procedure is to put the complaint in writing within the requisite time period as laid down in the Acts for the RTE Authority as follows: Prior to the complaint being made to the commission, the complaint is made to the Authority in writing and is received not <Col N="1480" /> more than 30 days after the date of the relevant broadcast.  Only if the complainant is dissatisfied with RTE's response may the complaint be referred as a last recourse to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Deputy's concern regarding the appointment of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  I can assure him that I, too, consider this body to be a crucial organ in overseeing the upholding of broadcasting standards.  It has over the years proved to be a highly esteemed arbiter of broadcasting standards. Its decisions have been beyond reproach.  The appointment of the members of the commission is a matter for Government and I will be submitting my proposals for the membership of the commission very shortly.  I am at present reviewing the operation of broadcasting legislation.  In the context of that review I will be examining <i>inter alia</i> all the broadcasting structures and responsibilities.  If I feel there is room for improvement I will include proposals for legislative change in these areas in my overall package of proposals that will follow from my review.</P>

    <P>St. James's Hospital is the principal centre for the treatment of the AIDS <Col N="1481" /> virus in Ireland.  To all intents and purposes, it is in effect the only properly equipped and resourced facility in the country.  The revelation that St. James's is now at the limit of its capacity to cope with its present number of AIDS-HIV patients, implies that any further increase in the number of people infected with the HIV virus will be unable to receive treatment at St. James's.  This situation must elevate consideration of the Government's AIDS strategy, such as it is, to the position of a major scandal.</P>
    <P>It is now imperative that the Government introduce in the Dáil without delay a Supplementary Estimate to provide a special budget for the prevention and treatment of AIDS.  For example, there is a dire need for a specialist AIDS consultant to be attached to each of our major hospitals.  In 1986 approval was granted by the Department of Health for the appointment of a second specialised consultant to be located on the north side of the city.  Moneys were allocated for the appointment of this consultant, but a second consultant was never appointed.</P>
    <P>Public health and education programmes in this area are minimal, following the abolition of the Health Education Bureau in 1987.  The so-called Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health is an acknowledged abject failure.  Information about the spread of HIV, care, prevention, diagnosis and compassion are just a few of the issues facing us in the fight against AIDS, which the Minister has publicly stated is of major concern.  These matters have not been sufficiently addressed and I welcome the Minister's concern.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health's education and prevention message, in their effort to prevent the further spread of HIV and AIDS in Ireland, places emphasis only on celibacy rather than confronting in a real way the issue.</P>
    <P>Ireland's critical shortage of information lies in our uncertainty about the extent of the spread of the HIV infection. It is imperative that the Government discover <Col N="1482" /> the prevalence of the infection in the population at large.  Deputy O'Rourke, the former Minister for Health, in her speech to mark World AIDS Day, announced that a single scheme of anonymous, unlinked testing for HIV infection had been started in a Dublin hospital.  Similar schemes have been under way in Britain and the US for some time and are producing useful information.</P>
    <P>There is no possibility of the patient or anyone else discovering whether a particular individual is infected.  Because every patient in the hospital is tested, the results should show, over a period, the extent of the infection in the population using the hospital.  I welcome the initiation of this anonymous random testing, but in order for us to receive an overall picture of the spread of AIDS-HIV virus in our community, the scheme must be extended to a number of hospitals.</P>
    <P>At present the Department of Health's figures for the HIV and AIDS virus are calculated on a national basis.  It would be more effective if the Department of Health figures were broken down on a regional basis in order to allow individual health boards to analyse and react to the AIDS-HIV virus in each locality.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the AIDS virus is shameful in its inadequacy. The Government continue to delay legislating for the wider accessibility of non-medical contraceptives, which must be seen as part of the AIDS prevention programme.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated that this will be an open and caring Government.  I have yet to see proof of this, although I recognise the Minister's concern and hope he will respond positively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased Deputy Ferris raised this issue and I congratulate him.  In doing so he is ensuring that the public are made much more aware of this serious public health problem and the need for us to <Col N="1483" /> take effective measures against it and to provide the very best care for the victims of AIDS.  I have read the statements in relation to the care and management of persons with AIDS and HIV at St. James's Hospital and I am concerned about them.</P>
      <P>I wish at the outset to pay tribute to the excellent work being done at St. James's by Dr. Fiona Mulcahy and her colleagues.  I am, however, a little concerned that the impression might be conveyed from the statements that the hospital may not be in a position to continue to provide the appropriate services for patients with HIV and AIDS, because this is not true.  In spite of the increasing number of persons with HIV and AIDS requiring services at the hospital, there is no question of any person with the disease not receiving the appropriate care.  I have always recognised that AIDS and HIV would make a significant impact on St. James's Hospital and that the hospital would have to be funded to take account of this fact.</P>
      <P>At present about 800 persons who are at varying stages of HIV and AIDS are attending that hospital and it is anticipated that, consistent with the natural history of the disease, an increasing number of these people will require in-patient care.  The majority of these patients come from the catchment area of St. James's and the hospital will continue to provide services for them during the period of their illness.  However, it is the policy of my Department that major acute hospitals should provide services for persons with HIV and AIDS who come from their own catchment areas. At present a number of the persons attending St. James's comes from outside the hospital's catchment area and as soon as appropriate services are developed elsewhere it can be anticipated that the hospital's HIV and AIDS workload will be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a major step towards the development of this policy I am pleased to <Col N="1484" /> announce that agreement has been reached by my Department with Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Mater and Beaumont hospitals that a consultant in infectious diseases will be appointed to serve the north side of Dublin &mdash; I made that announcement earlier today.  This post will be shared equally between the Mater and Beaumont and will facilitate the development of a hospital-based AIDS-HIV service for the north side of the city.  I am hopeful and determined that the post will be filled very soon.  I was very surprised and rather depressed to hear that this post was not filled some years ago.  It must be filled now as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>This development is part of a wider integrated AIDS-HIV service, the components of which are currently under examination by the National AIDS Strategy Committee of which I am chairman. I expect to announce full details of all the components in the very near future.  In broad terms, these will involve the provision of services as appropriate and when required at primary, secondary and tertiary care levels to individuals with AIDS and HIV virus, and will facilitate the care and management of such persons, including care outside the setting of acute hospitals.  The service will, of course, be provided nationwide.  I recognise, however, that St. James's Hospital has particular difficulties at present.  I am glad to be able to report to the House tonight that on my initiative and following discussions since February last between my Department and the hospital, agreement has been reached on measures and on the necessary funding to improve the present service for AIDS-HIV patients at the hospital.  I will take into account everything Deputy Ferris has said and ensure that effective measures are taken to deal with this national scourge which is reaching almost epidemic proportions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter tonight and, indeed, I am grateful to the Minister of State for being here.  After many years of strife, killing, hardship and suffering a ceasefire was finally arranged between the Government of EI Salvador and the FMLN.  That ceasefire came into effect on 1 February last and is being monitored by UN forces.  Under the terms of the New York peace accord which led to the ceasefire the nature and structure of the Salvadoran military and security forces are to be altered significantly and reduced substantially during the course of the next two years.</P>
      <P>The chairmen of the United States Senate sub-committee on foreign operations and on western hemisphere affairs, Senators Leahy and Dodd, are, it seems, of the view that Congress is prepared, in the light of the new situation, to delete any new funds for the El Salvador military aid account from the US fiscal provision. El Salvador urgently needs funds for humanitarian purposes and for the much delayed process of restructuring and reconstructing a shattered economy in which many thousands of families have been displaced.  As I understand it, there is a disposition in Congress in Washington to channel all of the funds originally earmarked for military aid in 1992 into the new fund for transition to peace to be used in support of the implementation of the peace agreement, including the demobilisation of combatants on the Government side and on the part of the FMLN.  Against that background I find it impossible to understand the Bush administration's proposal to grant further military aid to the Government of El Salvador amounting to $35 million for 1992 and $40 million for 1993, with the possibility that $28 million in unallocated aid from previous exercises might also be provided for military aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1980 successive administrations in the United States have channelled $1.1 <Col N="1486" /> billion of military aid into El Salvador. Those funds have supported widespread oppression and have resulted in slaughter and suffering in that country throughout that period.  It is surely time for the United States' administration to accept the fact that its Central American policy has been wholly misguided, that it has been inimical to human rights and obstructive of the emergence of viable democratic systems in the area.  Bearing that in mind, I would invite the Minister and the Government to support my case to oppose any further US military aid to the Government of El Salvador, to put those views forthrightly to the US administration at the earliest possible moment and to seek support for them among our partners in the United Nations.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy has mentioned, on 31 December 1991 the Salvadoran Government and the Farabundi Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) reached an historic accord with the aim of putting a definitive end to the armed conflict in El Salvador.  The final peace agreements were signed in Mexico City on 16 January 1992.  These call for major reforms in El Salvador's judicial and electoral system, the establishment of new human rights safeguards, reform and reduction of the armed forces, the disarming, over a nine month period, of the FMLN and their integration into the political life of the country. These agreements represent a major and positive advance in a situation of armed conflict which has lasted for 12 years and which has resulted in the deaths of at least 80,000 people.  Ireland, together with partners in the European Community and the other members of the international community welcome this important development as an historic opportunity to put an end to the conflict in El Salvador and to bring peace and reconciliation to its people.  Together with the international community, therefore, we will be concerned to ensure that <Col N="1487" /> nothing is done that could hinder or destroy progress in this direction.</P>
      <P>Among the proposals in the peace accords is the call for a reduction and scaling down of the army in El Salvador although, of course, not its total abolition. This is in keeping with the Central American regional disarmament framework within which it is the intention, through regional negotiations, to reduce armaments to a level commensurate with the needs of legitimate defence.  At the San Jose Ministerial Conference on 24 and 25 February 1992, which I attended, Ministers of the European Community and the countries of the Central American region agreed that reaching a regional balance of arms and military forces at as low a level as possible would substantially contribute to the consolidation of the peace process as well as to the economic development of Central America.</P>
      <P>According to the information available to me, the United States has asked Congress for approval for a package of $286 million in aid to El Salvador.  I understand that $246 million is to be in the form of economic aid and $40 million is to be in the form of military aid, the bulk of which is, I am informed, intended for subsistence purposes such as food, clothing, tents and medicine for the army in El Salvador.  It is my understanding that, in accordance with the peace accords, the Government of El Salvador plan to reduce the army to half its present strength over the next 24 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dukes is aware, the detailed implementation of the peace agreements in El Salvador is being monitored and verified by the United Nations, who are already on the ground in El Salvador in substantial numbers. On 15 January the Security Council approved the sending of 1,000 officers to the new UN force in El Salvador.  This force will consist of two components, one <Col N="1488" /> civil and the other military.  It will also incorporate the division for human rights which has been operating in El Salvador since last July.  The United Nations force on the ground will be monitoring and verifying the separation of the forces, the scaling down of the army and its reorganisation and retraining.  In this context, it will also be following closely the use to which any aid, including military aid, is put.  Together with partners in the Twelve and other members of the international community, I will be keeping myself fully informed of UN reports in these matters.</P>
    <P>The situation on the implementation and verification of the peace agreements will also be monitored by the group of friends, that is, Spain, Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico, who were actively involved with the Secretary General in assisting the negotiation of these peace accords and who therefore have a particular interest in following their implementation and ensuring that they are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the major concern of the international community as a whole is to see these agreements implemented and to aid the restructuring of the country.  We have reached an important and historic stage in the peace progress, not just in El Salvador but in the entire Central American region.  We have in these peace agreements the necessary ingredients to ensure reconciliation and development in El Salvador. We in Ireland, along with our partners in the European Community and the other members of the international community, will be paying close and careful attention to the monitoring and verification role of the United Nations in El Salvador and to ensuring that all that can be done will be done to realise the result intended in the peace agreements.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.45 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 March 1992.</P>

      <P>It has never been the practice for Ministers for Justice to report to the House on the progress of specific Garda investigations. I do not propose to depart from that practice now other than to say that the Garda investigation into this brutal murder is continuing.</P>
      <P>The Provisional IRA, who claimed responsibility for the murder of Mr. Oliver, attempted at the time to somehow justify this terrible crime.  The response they received from the people of the Cooley area, and from the rest of the country, has been one of total and utter rejection and condemnation.  The people of this island are sick and tired of the continuing atrocities of the Provisional IRA who are responsible for a long litany of murder and mayhem, North and South and further afield, for the past twenty years.  The revulsion and contempt felt by the people of Cooley, and by Irish people generally, as a result of this crime was accompanied also by an acute awareness of the evil threat posed by the Provisional IRA to every member of the community and to the democratic institutions of our State.</P>
      <P>There is a responsibility on all of us to ensure that the policy of intimidation by terror as practised by the Provisional IRA is resisted and that we support and co-operate with the forces of law and order who act on behalf of, and with the consent of, the community.  It must be made clear to those who wish to have their way by violence and terror that their policies and methods are unacceptable and that we reject them out of hand.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Deasy's question, the position is that the security arrangements at banks are the subject of constant review by the banks in consultation with the Garda Síochána.  The protection of staff, customers and money is discussed at regular meetings between the Garda authorities and representatives from the banks.  The provision of armed guards by the banks has not been the subject of discussion. However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they would not be in favour of such a proposal and I would agree with that view.</P>

    <P>Can I make it clear that no person may simply be committed to prison merely for the non-payment of a civil debt.  Committal usually takes place only after other <Col N="1088" /> avenues to enforce the debt have beeen exhausted.  There already exists a statutory mechanism in the Enforcement of Courts Orders Acts, 1926 and 1940 for the making and variation of instalment orders by the District Court in these cases.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day a person may still be committed to prison for failure to comply with the terms of an instalment order made or varied by the court.  But that final step may not be taken until it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that failure to pay on the part of the debtor was due to his wilful refusal or to his culpable neglect.</P>
    <P>As I said in response to a written question on 10 March 1992, consideration is being given in my Department to the introduction of a system of attachment of earnings to secure payment of judgment debts generally as well as court fines. This would require legislation and any proposals which I may have in the matter will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>

      <P>That is the position obtaining at all law centres, with the exception of three, and the number of people on waiting lists on 19 March 1992 at each law centre where it is the position was approximately as follows: Athlone, 29; Castlebar, 36; Cork, North Mall, 180; Cork, South Mall, 140; Dublin, Gardiner Street, 750; Dundalk, 25; Galway, 86; Letterkenny, 73; Limerick, 191; Sligo, 44; Tralee, 100; Waterford, 100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three exceptions are Aston's Place, Tallaght and Ormond Quay Law Centres.  The Aston's Place centre will be closing on the opening of the Clondalkin and Finglas Centres, so no new applications have been taken since March 1991.  All the staff are engaged in clearing <Col N="1090" /> the waiting list which has been reduced to 67.  The demand on the Tallaght Centre is such and the waiting list so long, 500 approximately, that by February 1992 it had become unrealistic to keep adding further names to the list.  As new applicants now call, they are informed that they should contact the law centre in January 1993 to have their names put on the waiting list.  In Ormond Quay a waiting list is not kept but applicants are requested to contact the law centre again on a specific day and on that day appointments would be offered on a &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo; basis to a number of those who returned.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the view that the scheme will require further development so that the waiting period, which I referred to, which applies in some cases can be shortened but, because of the need for careful management of public expenditure, particularly at this time, this is something that will have to be done on a phased basis in line with what we can afford to pay.  The arrangements which the board have put in place, in accordance with the provisions of the scheme, to deal with cases of emergency continue to operate effectively.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, it is not correct to suggest that the scheme is free.  Contributions are required of legally aided persons relative to their means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the continuing and pressing need to contain public expenditure, significant improvements have been made in recent years in the civil legal aid service. Since this Government took office in 1989 the board's annual grant-in-aid has been increased substantially in each of the subsequent years.  Vacancies for solicitors and administrative staff have been filled and additional staff have been recruited. Three new law centres were opened <Col N="1091" /> recently at Castlebar, Letterkenny and Dundalk, another two centres will be opened this year in the greater Dublin area, in Clondalkin and Finglas.  This will bring to 16 the number of full-time centres operating round the country.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the board that the opening of further part-time centres is under active consideration and also that it intends to put forward proposals in the near future for a further expansion of the scheme in 1993.  My response to any such proposals will, of course, depend on the budgetary situation at the time.</P>
      <P>During 1991, the income qualification limits for services under the scheme were raised from £5,500 disposable income per annum to £6,200, with a wide range of allowances increased to make more people eligible.  The threshold below which legal services are made available for the minimum contribution of £19 was increased to £4,400 disposable income per annum from the previous figure of £3,500.  This was the first revision of means test limits since 1986 and its purpose was to restore eligibility levels under the scheme in real terms to those which applied when it was first introduced.</P>
      <P>In March 1991 a Ministerial Policy Directive was issued to the board under the provisions of the scheme to enable legal assistance to be provided to complainants in legal proceedings in respect of cases of rape or aggravated sexual assault.  Extra staff were made available for this purpose.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of additional resources to the Legal Aid Board the position is that notwithstanding the very difficult budgetary position the grant-in-aid to the legal Aid Board has been increased again this year, for the third successive year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to have legislation to place the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory basis ready as soon as possible having regard to the numerous other important and urgent items of legislation that are being proposed as part of my legislation programme.  However, the non-statutory nature of the scheme is not and never has been an impediment <Col N="1092" /> to its operation and development.  This is evidenced by the fact that the scheme has expanded substantially since its inception and that important features of the scheme have been altered without undue formality to meet client needs which were not anticipated at the beginning but were subsequently recognised as matters that should be provided for within the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 68, 79, 82 and 84 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Garda crime statistics are not maintained in a way which would show the proportion of cases in which the victim <Col N="1093" /> was a spouse who had been subjected to domestic violence.  It would in fact be quite difficult for the Garda to isolate this statistic with any degree of accuracy.  The normal situation is that the Garda are called to deal with a domestic disturbance, sometimes involving parents, sometimes children, sometimes perhaps neighbours or other parties.  If the situation has been brought under control it may not be necessary &mdash; nor indeed desirable &mdash; for the Garda to proceed, then, to establish precisely who, if anybody, may have assaulted whom, whether the parties had a husband and wife or other relationship with each other and so on.  If there was reason for gathering such information for the purpose of a criminal prosecution, it would obviously be a different matter, but if the parties have settled their differences and are now prepared to admit that violence occurred, then it is quite simply impossible for the Garda to produce a complete picture on the incidence of violence.</P>
    <P>The number of occasions on which the Garda are called to deal with family rows indicates quite clearly however that the problem is one of significance.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the period from November 1991 to date the Garda have had 1,877 calls in the Dublin Metropolitan Area to deal with domestic disturbances.</P>
    <P>While it would not be possible to say that a spouse had been the victim of violence in all of these cases, there is no doubt that in a proportion &mdash; and probably a significant proportion &mdash; of them either a spouse or co-habitee would have suffered some violence either physical or psychological.  More often than not of course &mdash; and statistics produced by bodies such as the Legal Aid Board confirm this &mdash; the victim is a woman.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, there is now a heightened awareness that the incidence of criminal attacks on women generally is a problem of significant proportions.  I am pleased to say that this increased awareness is matched by a growing determination on the part of law enforcement agencies &mdash; including the Garda Síochána &mdash; to tackle <Col N="1094" /> the problem with every means at their disposal.</P>
    <P>An essential step in dealing with the issue is that it be brought out into the open and discussed.  For this reason as announced in the Law Enforcement Package for 1992, violence against women &mdash; including domestic violence &mdash; will be the subject of specific attention by law enforcement agencies this year.  As part of this endeavour, my Department will sponsor a national conference on the subject later in the year &mdash; hopefully in October &mdash; which will be addressed by experts from this country and elsewhere. This, I expect, will make a significant contribution to enlightened debate on the matter and improve understanding of what we need to do, as a society, in order to deal effectively with it.</P>
    <P>Another example of the attention being given to this issue by the Garda authorities is a joint research project into the problem being undertaken by the Garda College and St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.  This project is being undertaken in two phases.  The first phase will identify the relevant aspects of the problems and the second will involve the development of a programme to ensure that Garda procedures and training equip them fully with the skills and facilities to deal effectively with the problem.</P>
    <P>Of course some very important legislative measures in this field have been introduced such as the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 and, more recently, the Criminal Evidence Bill.  The Bill sets out to protect the victims of domestic violence by clearly establishing the circumstances in which the spouse of an accused is competent or compellable to give evidence.  For example, a wife will be obliged to give evidence for the prosecution if her husband is accused of violence against her or of violence or a sexual offence against a child.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the issue of domestic violence is being given every attention with a view to ensuring that the problem is effectively and sympathetically dealt with.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that through intelligence gathering and surveillance operations they are aware that <Col N="1096" /> a small number of persons are involved in the importation of drugs into this country. However, there is no evidence of any increase in the number of criminals with the financial resources and the organisational skills necessary to import large amounts of drugs into this country.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that the problem of drugs is one which will continue to receive the highest priority. The Garda authorities monitor the situation very closely and they constantly review and adapt their strategies to deal with it.  These strategies include close liaison with customs authorities and continuous international co-operation with police forces abroad so as to curb the supply of illicit drugs in this country.</P>
      <P>Intelligence-based strategies are extremely important in combating the importation of drugs and the closest international co-operation is therefore essential.  Such co-operation is being furthered and enhanced in a number of areas in which my Department is involved.  The TREVI Group has as its principal aim to encourage and facilitate police co-ordination and co-operation in Europe against criminal activity including drug trafficking, and it concentrates on practical measures and initiatives to achieve this.  In addition, the European Council has decided that a Europol Drugs Unit should be established as soon as possible to act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit for, in particular, drug-related information between member states.</P>
      <P>Initiatives have also been taken in the legislative area.  One of the most effective measures which can be taken against drug traffickers is to deprive them of the profits gained from their illegal activity and work on a Bill dealing with this matter is proceeding as a matter of priority.  I expect to be able to introduce this Bill at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While every effort is made to deal with drug abuse through law enforcement, this alone cannot solve the problem. Every member of society has a role to play and this role can be as important as the Garda response.  The Government is aware that there is a need to tackle the <Col N="1097" /> drug problem on every front through a national drug strategy.  As part of this work my colleague, the Minister for Health, last year launched the Government Strategy to prevent drug misuse, which sets realistic and achievable objectives for the reduction both in the supply of and demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy and the House that the drug problem has and will continue to be the subject of ongoing attention by the relevant authorities.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that those courthouses in Dublin city which are provided and maintained by the Office of Public Works are in generally good condition.</P>
      <P>A few courthouses in Dublin and all courthouses outside Dublin are the responsibility of local authorities under the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935.  I accept that many of these courthouses are in deplorable condition due mainly to the reluctance of local authorities over the years to spend money on them.  For this reason, the Government in March 1990, decided in principle to transfer this financial responsibility to the Exchequer.  Unfortunately the very difficult financial situation and the continuing need to contain public expenditure has meant that it has been possible to implement the Government decision only to a very limited extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the available funds have been sufficient to enable only a small number of capital projects to be approved and it <Col N="1098" /> has not been possible to recoup any part of local authority expenditure on courthouse running costs.  Regrettably there can be no change in that position for the current year.  Local authorities are, accordingly, expected to continue to make provision for courthouse running costs and essential repairs as heretofore.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping the matter under continuous review and it is my intention to implement the Government decision in full as soon as the financial situation permits, but I must emphasise that all of the courthouses in need of refurbishment cannot be dealt with at the same time. Financial resources will, I expect, continue to be limited for some time yet so that priorities will have to be set between the various premises requiring attention. So far as possible the cases of greatest need will be dealt with first.  I am satisfied that in due course the new arrangements will lead to a significant improvement in the standard of court accommodation.</P>

    <P>Records are not maintained in a way which would enable the Minister for Justice to say exactly how much the investigation of a particular criminal offence was costing.  All gardaí have a role to play in the investigation of major crimes of this kind and remain alert to the possibility that information coming into their possession in the course of their routine duties may be relevant to the investigation.  The Deputy will appreciate that would be quite impossible to trace and account for the contribution made <Col N="1103" /> by each and every member of the force in cases like this.  Two things can be said however &mdash; firstly that the additional cost of investigating major crimes of this nature is quite considerable and, secondly, that no effort has been or will be spared in this instance to bring the perpetrators to justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Given the wide range of measures introduced by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, which provide a sound framework within which the problem of under-age drinking can be tackled, I do not accept that it is not possible to enforce the law relating to under-age drinking. The basic approach behind these measures is to make it as difficult as legislatively feasible for a person under 18 years of age to purchase or otherwise obtain alcohol or to consume it other than in a private residence, and, where these rules are broken, to make it possible for the Garda to seize it.  It would be inappropriate to introduce new measures until there has been more time to assess the impact of the measures introduced by the 1988 Act.  There is reason to believe that the existing measures are beginning to have a positive effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the view that the problem of under-age drinking cannot be solved by legislation alone.  The social, cultural and economic factors involved in this problem must be taken into consideration.  It is for this reason that I promote and encourage the idea of community-based initiatives and the Garda Síochána have been encouraged to become involved in organising and assisting such local initiatives to deal with alcohol abuse by persons under age.  I understand that there is Garda involvement in 26 existing voluntary local identity card schemes, which by and large are operating successfully, <Col N="1105" /> and that moves are afoot to establish further schemes in other areas.  The indications are that local schemes backed by a strong community involvement make a positive contribution to tackling under-age drinking and I consider that for the present at least, the way forward lies in the development of further such schemes rather than in the introduction of a national scheme with all that that entails.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that a section 47 order prohibiting sales of drink by self-service methods in outlets such as supermarkets and off-licences is necessary to supplement the wide range of measures already in place to curb under-age drinking. I will continue to keep this matter under regular review but in so doing I will have to have regard to the repercussions, financial and otherwise, of such an order for the outlets concerned.</P>

      <P>I must begin by referring to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 147 of 19 February and informing the Deputy that having now received information from the Garda for the purpose of answering today's questions it seems to me to be quite probable that the reply he received to his earlier question on 19 February had the unintended effect of misleading him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities who, in accordance with normal practice, were asked for material for a reply to that earlier question focused their attention on computer data held centrally in the criminal records office at Garda headquarters and stated that information had neither been sought by Social Welfare nor supplied to them from that source.  The reply given to the Deputy, which was based on this information, was, unfortunately, incomplete because it took no account of the possibility that information might be provided by the Garda other than through the Criminal Records Office at Garda <Col N="1108" /> headquarters.  The incompleteness of the reply, which was due to a genuine misunderstanding, is regretted.</P>
    <P>I have now been informed by the Garda authorities that, in accordance with their duty under the appropriate social welfare legislation to assist in the control of schemes administered by or on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare, the Garda at local level transfer information regarding persons prosecuted for street trading offences to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>With regard to the attendance of a Garda at the recent social welfare appeals hearing mentioned by the Deputy I am also informed by the Garda authorities that a member of the force was summonsed in that case by the Social Welfare Appeals Office to attend the hearing for the purpose of giving evidence in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.</P>

      <P>Participation by prisoners in education is voluntary and quite a large number of prisoners do not participate.  Consequently, information in relation to the overall education levels and attainments of prisoners is not available.</P>
      <P>Education in prison is provided principally by the Vocational Education Committees with other education agencies such as the Open University, the University of Limerick and regional technical colleges also participating.  The courses provided range from basic literacy and numeracy to third level education. At present the Department of Education provides 130 full-time teacher equivalents to work in prisoners and places of detention and prisoners who wish to participate in an education are accommodated irrespective of their ability or attainments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The methods appropriate to education in prison relate far more closely to the approaches of adult or community education <Col N="1110" /> than to traditional school-based education.  Because of this approach, whereby the education is geared to meet the specific needs and interests of the prisoner, and because of the fact that the majority of prisoners are in prison for short periods, conventional &ldquo;performance indicators&rdquo; of attainment are not appropriate.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the number of ordinary civil cases heard in the District Courts declined from 74,132 in 1988 to 58,845 in 1990; if this trend continued in 1991; and whether this reflects, in any way, on the efficiency of the courts in this type of case or on the pressure of other business.</Quest>

      <P>The numbers of ordinary civil cases dealt with in the District Court in the years referred to by the Deputy are as follows: 1988, 74,132; 1989, 66,714; 1990, 59,845; 1991, 66,982.</P>
      <P>These figures are in respect of legal years ended 31 July.</P>
      <P>A wide variety of factors affect the numbers of civil cases being brought before the District Court.  During the period mentioned by the Deputy and dating back to 1982, the jurisdiction limit of the District Court in civil cases was fixed at £2,500.  Due to inflation, the number of claims under the jurisdiction limit of £2,500 would be expected to decline.  Claims above the District Court jurisdiction limit would be appropriate to be dealt with in the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the District Court jurisdiction limit of £2,500 mentioned has been increased, by the Courts Act, 1991, to £5,000.  As a result, the <Col N="1111" /> volume of civil business before the District Court is again likely to increase.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the major problems that exist in country towns in the west of Ireland where an unprecedented amount of casual trading is carried out illegally; if he will allow county councils to introduce regulations to prohibit such trading on public streets; and if he will provide for the designation of areas where such trading can be carried out as has been done successfully in Roscrea, County Tipperary for a number of years.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of some difficulties relating to casual trading activities which have arisen in certain areas of the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The basic intention of the Casual Trading Act, 1980 is to enable local authorities, free from central Government control, to decide the places within their functional areas where casual trading may lawfully take place, and by means of by-laws and/or conditions attached to casual trading permits to regulate such trading.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are empowered under the Act to designate casual trading areas, and where such areas are designated it is an offence for a casual trader to trade elsewhere in the functional area of that local authority.  There is no limit on the number of areas which a local authority may designate.  Where a local authority does not exercise their power to designate, a licensed casual trader who may trade in any public place of that local authority is still subject to any restrictions imposed by road traffic or other legislation.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the local authorities themselves to assess the implications of choosing not to designate one or more casual trading areas.  It is a matter of regret, in my opinion, that some local authorities choose not to take the steps open to them under the Act.</P>

      <P>At national level, there are in excess of 80 Community measures, already adopted under the programme, which require transposition into Irish law.  Thirty-seven of these are overdue, but the Government are committed to ensuring their implementation at the earliest possible date.  The majority of the remainder will become due this year, with the balance coming into force in 1993 and after. It can be expected that most of the 63 items yet to be adopted will also require transposition into national law.</P>

      <P>The Government are anxious to ensure the ongoing viability of the national lottery so as to safeguard this important source of funding for the many socially desirable programmes which are now assisted by the national lottery.</P>
      <P>Occasional large jackpots are popular with players.  They help to sustain public interest in the lotto and encourage additional players to participate.  They thus help to ensure its on-going success.</P>
      <P>To put a &ldquo;cap&rdquo; or ceiling on the size of lotto jackpots would, I feel, run the risk of undermining public interest in participation and could well jeopardise the long term success of the game.

I also indicated that, in designing the new charge to produce broadly equivalent revenue, my aim would be to take account of established administrative control and enforcement arrangements to the extent that revenue <Col N="1122" /> collection considerations allow.  The Government are at present considering the details of the administrative arrangements to apply and the results will be reflected in the forthcoming Finance Bill.

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the way in which the fee for public house licences as announced in the 1992 budget, will be computed; the multiplier of rateable valuation he proposes to use for this purpose; and the alternative method he intends using in relation to liquor licences for hotels.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 106, 107 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>I announced in the budget that the annual charge for public house licences would, in future, be based on the rateable valuation of the premises concerned.  A similar approach would be applied in relation to liquor licences for hotels although, in setting the applicable rate, account would be taken of the fact that the valuations of such premises reflected wider considerations than bar turnover alone.  In framing these proposals, I considered that the present uniform rate of £100, which is applicable to all premises, irrespective of location and turnover, is highly inequitable and that this inequity would be further accentuated by any across the board increase.</P>
      <P>I have subsequently received representations from both the Licensed Vintners Association and the Vintners Federation of Ireland asserting that many publicans already face severe difficulties and that these problems would be greatly exacerbated by the implementation of the approach to licensing outlined in the budget.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, however, that in most cases, possession of a licence from the State to sell alcohol conveys significant benefits and opportunities for profit and I intend to follow through on the original proposal.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the detailed provisions for the new system, which will be contained in the Finance Bill, I will seek to ensure that all types of liquor licences are treated fairly and equitably having regard to the different nature, conditions and scope of the various type of licences.  The points raised by the publicans' representatives will be considered in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In framing this proposal, I should say that my objective has been to ensure that the State receives a fair return for the benefits conveyed by the restricted issue of liquor licences.  I am satisfied that these new charges, which will be modest as a <Col N="1125" /> proportion of turnover, should not be unduly onerous on publicans.  I would point out, in that context, that the Government have refrained from increasing excise duties on alcohols and that, consequently, the real level of tax on alcoholic drink has fallen significantly, in recent years.</P>
    <P>I also announced in the budget that applicants for certain licences, including publicans' licences, will be required to produce a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  The Finance Bill will contain the necessary provisions to allow me extend tax clearance in this way.  I would emphasis that tax clearance does not give rise to any liability where none already exists.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline separately for each Government Department the following information, (a) the number of visual display units currently installed in each Government Department, (b) the number of personal computers, excluding dedicated word processors, installed in each Government Department and (c) the number of dedicated word processors in each Government Department.</Quest>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy cannot be compiled under the categories requested.  The term &ldquo;visual display unit&rdquo; can include personal computers and networked workstations.  For the purposes of part (a) of the current question a narrower definition covering terminals with no processing power of their own, dumb terminals, linked directly to a mainframe or minicomputer has been used.  In the Civil Service these are normally used for transaction processing, eg taxation cases or social welfare claims. Some of these do run office automation software such as word-processing as well as transaction processing software.</P>
      <P>The figures at (b) include personal computers both stand alone and operating on networks.  All of these machines are capable of running word-processing as well as other office automation software such as electronic mail, spreadsheets and databases.</P>
      <P>Dedicated word-processors, i.e. machines which are capable of running only wordprocesing software, are no longer purchased or used in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the reliefs available under the disabled drivers scheme established by the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, applicants must satisfy one or more of the medical criteria specified in those regulations. Assessment of claimants is made by reference to these criteria by the directors of community care and medical officer of health in the local health boards.  I understand that the person in question has been refused certification by his local director of community care and is not, therefore, entitled to the reliefs available. However, that decision may be appealed to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, c/o National Rehabilitation Board, 25 Clyde Road, Dublin 4, if an appeal has not already been lodged.  It would not be appropriate for me to interfere with the professional judgments of the medical personnel involved in the operation of the existing scheme.</P>

    <P>**These estimates are very tentative and are subject to a wide margin of error.</P>
    <P>The figures for 1989-90 and 1990-91 are provisional and subject to revision.</P>
    <P>Some of the cost figures now provided differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>In regard to the estimates above relating to the cost to the Exchequer of Export Sales Relief, &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief and the reduced rate of tax for manufacturing profits, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises might not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of each cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Notes on Table</P>
    <P>Export sales relief and &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief</P>
    <P>The cost estimates relating to export sales relief and &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief are based on the assumption that the profits involved would have been charged at the standard rate of corporation tax, which varied from 50 per cent to 43 per cent for the years in question, were it not for the reliefs.  These reliefs were terminated from 5 April 1990, with the profits becoming chargeable to tax at the 10 per cent rate where they qualify under the appropriate provisions.</P>
    <P>The figures for each year include the tax relief relevant to accounting periods which ended in that year and to earlier accounting periods in so far as such relief was allowed in that year.</P>
    <P>Manufacturing profits</P>
    <P>These figures represent the estimated loss to the Exchequer arising from the charging of manufacturing and other qualifying profits at reduced rates of corporation tax instead of at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>Reduced rate of corporation tax for small companies</P>
    <P>The reduced rate of tax was terminated as respects profits and interest arising after 1 April, 1989.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 84&rdquo; loans</P>
    <P>These figures include preference share financing which is a minor element in the total.  The figures are gross figures, and do not take account of the yield from the levy on section 84 loan interest which was introduced in 1986.  This levy yielded £24.9 million in 1989, and £27 million in 1990.</P>
    <P>Capital Allowances</P>
    <P>The cost figure included for each year in respect of income tax is estimated by reference to accounting periods ending in the year to 5 April immediately preceding each of the years in question, eg year ended 5 April 1980 relates to the column headed 1980-81.  For corporation tax the cost figures relate to accounting periods ending during each of the years in question.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has satisfied himself with the equity of the system known as co-ordinated pensions, whereby persons in semi-State bodies have their annual income from their pensions fund reduced by a sum equivalent to their contributory old age pension; if he will outline the approximate number of workers affected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general purpose of the system of pension co-ordination for public servants who have full PRSI cover is to ensure that the total retirement pensions of these employees, i.e., their occupational pensions plus their entitlements under the social welfare code, are not excessively high by comparison with their colleagues who have modified PRSI cover.  I am satisfied that the system is equitable, and that in achieving its purpose it strikes a fair balance between the employees' entitlement to an adequate level of income on retirement on the one hand, and the cost implications for the State as employer on the other.  I should add that the practice of pension co-ordination for employees in full PRSI cover is not confined to semi-State bodies &mdash; it also applies elsewhere in the public sector and is a feature of some private sector pension schemes.</P>
      <P>In the time available, it is not possible to furnish the number of public servants to whom the pension co-ordination system applies.  However the total number of public servants in full PRSI cover is approximately 150,000, and the vast majority of these employees are in occupational pension schemes which provide for pension co-ordination on the general lines described by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer signed a customs declaration on 2 March 1990 declaring that he had transferred his normal residence to Ireland.  On the basis <Col N="1147" /> of this declaration he is regarded as resident in this country for the years 1989-90 and 1990-91.</P>
      <P>The effect of the taxpayer's declaration was that he was able to import a car and personal effects free of duty and value added tax.  However, in view of the information supplied the Commissioners have informed me that the taxpayer should contact the Collector, Customs and Excise, Government Buildings, The Glen, Waterford, (Telephone 051-77011) who will arrange with the inspector of taxes to re-examine his residence position in this country.</P>

      <P>In the interview to which the Deputy refers I accepted that net emigration may recur in the future, when economic activity picks up in those countries to which Irish emigrants have traditionally gone, and which are currently in recession.  To acknowledge this is not, however, to suggest that emigration is an acceptable solution to Irish unemployment. I do not consider that emigration would be a satisfactory long term solution to Irish unemployment.  Rather, I believe that it would be unrealistic, in any assessment of prospective developments, to ignore the potential impact of migration on the labour force and unemployment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The broad thrust of the Government's strategy for expanding economic activity and employment is as set out successively in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i><Col N="1148" /> the Programme for Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> That strategy is working.  It has restored unemployment growth and is set, as international activity picks up, to underpin further expansion of sustainable jobs.  The Government acknowledge, however, that even more rapid economic progress, and employment growth, is required having regard to prevailing high levels of unemployment and prospective increases in demand for jobs. In this context it has taken a variety of initiatives, including the Industrial Policy Review Group, the Task Force on Employment and the Tourism Task Force; and to further assist in strengthening the employment growth potential of our economy, the Government have proposed an all-party Oireachtas Committee on Employment.</P>

      <P>EIB global loans are lines of credit opened to intermediary banks and other financial institutions, which on-lend in smaller amounts for investment projects corresponding to the EIB's financing criteria which are set out in Annex I.  EIB makes these loans on strictly commercial terms.</P>
      <P>Additional criteria may be operated by the intermediaries concerned.  ICC and ACC accounted for the bulk of the loans granted to Irish firms.  To encourage investment in small firms the State provided exchange risk cover for these loans confining them to firms with fixed assets of less than £1 million and employing fewer than 100 people.</P>
      <P>The EIB has provided the following information: Between 1973 and end-1991, the EIB assisted a total of 1,708 Irish small and medium sized enterprises through global loans totalling IR£148.5 million, as opposed to the figure of £145,500,000 which appears in the question on the Order Paper.  The average size loan to individual companies over the period was IR£87,000.</P>
      <P>Names and details of specific firms are not available as the loans are negotiated privately through the commercial lending institutions.  Annex II gives a size breakdown of enterprises by number of employees and a breakdown of the loans by sector which may also be of assistance.</P>
      <P>Intermediaries who administer global loans apply the same eligibility criteria regarding credit worthiness to loans financed under the global loans scheme as they do to their own existing loan facilities.</P>
      <P>Under the global loans scheme, funds are only advanced by EIB to the intermediary according as specific projects are identified and approved.</P>

      <P>The second phase of the Royal Canal Restoration Programme commenced in January 1990 and involves the restoration of the Royal Canal stretches between Blanchardstown and the River Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restoration works involve the dredging of the canal to navigational depth, removal of spoil, installation of new lockgates and the rewatering of levels as required.  The final full set of lockgates needed for the city sections of the canal are currently being installed by the Office of Public Works at the North Strand.  The remaining dredging work, between Binn's Bridge, Drumcondra and the River Liffey at North Wall Quay, will be carried out during the summer. Agreement has also been reached by the Commissioners of Public Works with Iarnród Éireann for the replacement of the railway culvert on the canal, east of <Col N="1153" /> North Strand bridge, with a new swing bridge.  This should be installed before the end of the year.  With the completion of these works it will then be possible for boats to travel on the Royal Canal from the Liffey to Mullingar.</P>
    <P>Once the major engineering works associated with the restoration of this stretch of the canal have been completed the Office of Public Works hopes to undertake follow up environmental improvement works and restock the canal with coarse fish.</P>
    <P>The works currently being carried out by the Office of Public Works on the canal will dramatically improve the environment in this area and provide a visible and valuable amenity for the local residents which can be appreciated and enjoyed by all.</P>

      <P>The plot of land in question forms part of the north bank of the Royal Canal between Granard Bridge and Kirpatrick Bridge in Castleknock, County Dublin.  For the most part, the canal bank along this stretch is relatively wide and offers considerable scope for development as a canalside amenity area.  The area adjoining the canal bank is comprised of three housing estates namely, Delwood, Brompton and Roselawn.  The Office of Public Works commissioned a special report from consultants to determine how the potential of the bank could be realised and the area integrated with adjoining properties.</P>

    <P>During the course of the restoration works in this section of the canal in June 1990, the intention was to carry out limited <Col N="1154" /> bank clearance works to provide access along the bank.  However, some residents from the Roselawn estate objected and the works were deferred pending discussions.  To date, despite patient and protracted discussions, the residents have not yet withdrawn their objections to the development of the bank.</P>
    <P>In view of the interests of all the residents of the locality and the considerable costs incurred by the office of Public Works in having a detailed plan drawn up for the development of the bank as an amenity area I have now requested the Commissioners of Public Works to ensure that they finalise their discussions with Roselawn residents and proceed with their plans for the implementation of the consultants recommendations as soon as possible.</P>

Felling was prohibited pending an examination of the proposal by the Forest Service of my Department.

This arrangement has not worked satisfactorily in recent years because of the reluctance of local authorities to spend money on courthouses.  For this reason the Government decided in principle to transfer financial responsibility for courthouses to the Exchequer.  Unfortunately the very difficult financial situation and the continuing need to contain public expenditure has meant that it has been possible to implement the Government decision only to a very limited extent.</P>
      <P>To date, the available funds have been sufficient to enable only a small number of capital projects to be approved and it has not been possible to recoup any part of local authority expenditure on courthouse running costs.  Regrettably there can be no change in that position for the current year.  Local authorities are, accordingly, expected to continue to make provision for courthouse running costs and essential repairs as heretofore.</P>
      <P>On the plus side, however, the Minister for Finance took a decision to writeoff outstanding local loans fund charges relating to courthouse accommodation with effect from 1 January 1991.  The effect of this is that any local authority which in the past, and up to the end of 1990, borrowed money from the local loans fund to pay for the renovation of a courthouse does not now have to repay it.</P>

Such competitions are, in the normal course, advertised in the national newspapers. The last time such a competition was advertised by the Civil Service Commission was in July 1990.  Qualifying written tests were conducted during October 1990 and candidates who attained sufficiently high placings in those tests had competitive interviews.</P>

He was admitted and had surgery peformed on 29 October 1990.

One such postponement arose because, due to an oversight, steps were not taken in the prison to ensure the offender was fasting from the previous night.

      <P>The area of the law concerned here is occupiers' liability.  It is complex and involves a wide range of interests.  These interests may be divided into two broad categories: the many types of occupier, including farmers, householders, tenants, State authorities, even the State itself, and the different legal classes of entrant, invitees, licencees and trespassers. <Col N="1171" /> Given the complexity of the law, the many different interests involved and the fact that the law is currently in a state of transition, the matter of possible legal changes is an ideal one for examination by the Law Reform Commission. I understand that the Attorney General has formally requested the President of the Commission to undertake that task.</P>
      <P>As soon as the commission complete their work, the question of any possible amendment of the law will be addressed.</P>

They are aware, however, that dog fights, which of their nature would involve some degree of organisation, have taken place. All reports or intelligence in relation to such incidents are very fully investigated and are where appropriate referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to the initiation of proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities also inform me that the particular matter referred to by the Deputy is the subject of a full and thorough Garda investigation.  It is not the practice for the Minister for Justice to give detailed information to the House about individual Garda investigations except in singular instances where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that such a course is deemed to be appropriate.

      <P>Garda records show that in the Cork city area, 19,221 burglar alarm calls were received in 1989, 20,597 in 1990 and 20,299 in 1991.  On average the number of those calls that proved to be false was 97 per cent.</P>
      <P>This very high level of false calls in the Cork city area is a reflection of the situation being experienced countrywide. This means that the alarms systems in question, which were intended as a useful instrument of crime prevention, are now, on balance, operating in a way which is wasteful of resources and hampers the gardaí.  False calls can be attributed to carelessness, poor quality equipment and faulty installation/maintenance.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply to Question No. 239 on 3 March 1992, the Garda Commissioner has put proposals to my Department for a new policy to deal with the unacceptably high level of false alarm calls.  The details of this policy are being finalised at present and I intend to make an announcement shortly in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">

      <P>The Garda Síochána have always endeavoured to promote good relations between the force and all members of the community including young people.  As part of the training, gardaí are encouraged to involve themselves in social and sporting organisations at community level so as to enable them to play a full part in the life of the community and build a sound relationship with young and adult members of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years a number of specific measures have been taken to build a closer relationship between gardaí and young people.  The Garda community policing scheme places special emphasis on contact with young people in the <Col N="1175" /> organisation of youth events and involvement in youth clubs and other organisations which cater for young people. There are now community gardaí working in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway who have a special role in working with young people and the benefits of their work are already apparent in the areas in which they work.</P>
    <P>Last year saw the implementation of the first reforms of the Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme since its inception in 1963.  There is now a national juvenile office at Garda DMA Headquarters, Harcourt Square which co-ordinates and monitors the operation of the scheme throughout the country.  Other new developments to make the scheme more effective in helping young people who become involved in crime include: a new and greater emphasis on the use of a caution rather than prosecution of young offenders; tailoring of Garda supervision to meet the individual needs of each juvenile; improved and extended training of juvenile liaison officers and rostering of juvenile liaison officers for night and weekend working to ensure better contact with parents and young people involved in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Garda schools programme is now in operation in primary schools in Tallaght, Coolock and Portmarnock in Dublin and will be extended to schools in Cork and Limerick later this year.  The programme involves specially prepared classroom visits by selected and trained members of the gardaí with the purpose of helping young people to develop positive attitudes towards law enforcement and the gardaí.  The schools involved have regular visits from the community gardaí based in their area who are involved in the scheme.  The gardaí give talks on topics such as crime, vandalism and road safety, with particular emphasis on cycling, skateboards and motorcycles. They also discuss the grave risks to young people from alcohol and drugs and encourage them to develop a positive attitude towards their local environment. They are also encouraged to develop an <Col N="1176" /> understanding of the garda's role in their community.</P>
    <P>In addition to JLO and schools programmes which are organised by the Garda authorities, there are also a number of community-based projects in which the gardaí co-operate with the probation and welfare service and statutory and non-statutory agencies in helping young people to steer clear of crime. These projects include the GRAFT project in Ronanstown, the KEY project in Killinarden, the WHAD project in Cherry Orchard and the Outreach project in Southill, Limerick.  The co-operation of the different agencies in the running of these projects is indicative of the need &mdash; as is now recognised internationally &mdash; for a much wider response to juvenile crime than that which can be provided by the Garda Síochána on its own.  This need for more broadly-based co-operation is also reflected in the involvement of Assistant Secretaries from the Departments of Justice, Education, Environment, Health, Labour and Social Welfare as well as representatives from Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and the IDA in the interdepartmental committee on crime problems in certain urban areas which was established last November.  I am aware that the committee are currently focusing on the needs of young people in the Ronanstown area and that there will in due course look at the needs of young people in areas of Cork and Limerick cities.</P>

I am <Col N="1177" /> convinced that the temporary loss of manpower to the Garda Síochána in providing contingents for such missions is far out-weighed by the long-term benefits which accrue to the force through the experience gained by the members who serve on them, though clearly there is a limit to how much we can do in this regard.  The despatch of a 15-Garda contingent to Yugoslavia will not unduly affect the quality of service provided in this country by a Garda force whose current overall serving strength is 10,871.</P>

      <P>There is a long-standing arrangement whereby unemployment benefit and assistance claims are certified by the Garda Síochána where claimants reside over six miles from their nearest social welfare exchange.  The involvement of the gardaí in this certification work has ensured a more convenient service for claimants and proved highly effective in controlling abuse of the unemployment payment schemes.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, discussions have taken place between representatives of the Garda Síochána and officials of my Department and the Department of Social Welfare with a view to making alternative arrangements for the certification of unemployment claims at locations where this work is causing undue disruption to normal Garda duties.  Substantial progress has already been made in eliminating disruption at busy Dublin stations and I understand that the Department of Social Welfare are currently considering certain measures which would relieve the burden of certification work at both urban and rural Garda stations.

      <P>The report of the advisory group on prison deaths was published in October, 1991. The report contained 57 recommendations which suggested improvements in practice and procedure, staff training, improvements in general facilities for prisoners, the provision of additional institutions, changes in design and so on.  To date 26 of these have been implemented including the extension of medical orderly cover, the setting up of suicide prevention groups in each institution, the review of special observation lists, improvements in committal assessment arrangements, introduction of resuscitation equipment, improved psychological services, access to prisons by the Samaritans and so on.  In addition new types of specially designed windows, which reduce the risk of suicide have been introduced and will be extended to other prisons in the course of new developments.  Arrangements are also in train for the implementation of a further 13 of the recommendations.  The remaining recommendations &mdash; some of which were envisaged by the advisory group as being long term in nature &mdash; are being taken fully into account in the context of overall development in the prison system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>The overall strength of the Garda Síochána is kept under regular review in the light of ever changing policing needs and circumstances.  The current Garda strength of 10,871 is of the order of police manpower which this country can sustain at the present time and which is appropriate to our needs.  The current ratio of gardaí to population compares very favourably with the police/population ratio in other EC member states and I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána is well resourced by international standards.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion inherent in Question No. 171 that there have been widespread closures and down gradings of Garda stations and that the developing needs of towns and villages have not been taken into account in the distribution of Garda manpower.  Neither I nor my predecessor have closed or downgraded any Garda station and the manning levels at each individual Garda station is constantly monitored by the Garda authorities to ensure that the service provided is commensurate with local policing needs.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the current Garda strengths at stations in County Kildare have been decided having regard to the policing needs of the county in the context of the overall demands on Garda manpower which must be met.  They assure me that measures are being taken to meet the crime situation in the county.</P>

The funds available under this scheme are fully committed and, consequently, it is not possible to make a grant available for the refurbishment of the athletics track at Cork Regional Technical College.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the valid enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>In the case of Drumshanbo national school there were 224 pupils validly enrolled in the school on 30 September 1991, which warrants a staff of principal plus six assistants for the 1992-93 school year.  The school will also have the services of a full-time remedial teacher.  The post of seventh assistant will be discontinued with effect from 31 August 1992.</P>
      <P>There were 12 pupils enrolled in a repeat sixth class on 30 September 1991. Pupils who have completed sixth standard in a national school should transfer to a post primary school in accordance with accepted practice.  Only in exceptional circumstances will such pupils, if retained in a national school, be considered to be validly enrolled for staffing and other purposes.</P>

    <P>It may be assumed that the vast majority of, if not all, schools who returned themselves as providing German at the various levels are providing it as an examination subject.  The number of candidates taking German in the intermediate certificate examination has more than doubled from 1989 to 1991 while at the leaving certificate the increase has been 56 per cent.</P>
    <P>The number of schools offering German in 1987-88 was about 230.  There has, therefore, been a significant increase in recent years in the number and percentage of schools providing German both as part of the new junior certificate programme and to leaving certificate level.  This increase reflects the importance attached by my Department to modern languages in the context of European integration and the Single European Act.  It follows the introduction some years ago of a scheme whereby post primary schools which were introducing a second modern continental language into their curriculum, could apply to my Department for assistance in the form of a part-time hours allocation over and above normal staffing arrangements to <Col N="1196" /> enable them to do this.  This scheme is still in operation and I am satisfied that it has contributed and will continue to contribute to the increase in the number of students taking German at post-primary level.</P>

      <P>The position is that in 1971 an arrangement was made through the Library Council, whereby local authority librarians would provide library services to primary schools.  My Department agreed to make a grant available for this purpose.  The grant has been increased for 1992 from 38p per pupil to 47p per pupil.</P>
      <P>The grant is paid in respect of all primary school pupils in each local authority area.  The money is distributed to the chief librarian of the local authority area and, supplemented by other funds at the disposal of the librarian, it is used to buy books for lending or distribution to schools.</P>
      <P>In 1989 my Department provided an allocation of £1 million funded by the national lottery for the replenishment of the stock of books used for the national school libraries scheme.  In the case of second level schools the Department make grants available for the running costs of the schools and it is open to schools to buy books for their libraries out of these grants.</P>

      <P>A grant-in-aid of £1.775 million has been allocated to SFADCo for administration and general expenses associated with tourism promotion and traffic development in 1992.  This level of grant-in-aid was set in the context of a very difficult budgetary situation and I cannot offer any hope of an increased allocation.  I would point out that the grant represents a 1 per cent reduction on the allocation of £1.8 million set for 1991 and less than 5 per cent on the actual 1991 outturn.</P>

The group highlighted the deficiencies they found in the present organisation of this service and made extensive recommendations concerning the improvement of the operational management of out-patients departments.  Following publication of the report, my Department formally requested all acute hospitals to take the necessary steps to implement the recommendations in the report including those relating to out-patient services.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently been in touch again with all acute hospitals reminding them of the need to implement these recommendations at the earliest possible date.  In particular, I am anxious that an out-patients service group be established in each hospital with a view to putting in place an effective appointments system for patients attending out-patient clinics.  All hospitals have been requested to report back within the next month, to my Department, on the progress made to date on implementing the recommendations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 and 232 together.  It is the Eastern Health Board's policy that the need for dental treatment in national primary school children be identified through school screenings and that treatment offered is based not on demand, but on need.</P>
      <P>The change from a demand-based system to a planned systematic service was introduced following a detailed study of the dental services in the Eastern Health Board area in 1989.  Changes in the pattern of disease and the emergence of new technology mean that greater improvements in oral health can be achieved by targeting the service at specific age groups.</P>
      <P>The system is now in place in all Eastern Health Board areas of examining children on an incremental basis in school classes and providing comprehensive dental education, preventive (fissure sealing) and treatment services for children. The objective is to ensure that children have at least three examinations during their primary school years.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that, in this way, children for whom a service was previously rarely, if ever, demanded&mdash;often those in lower socio-economic groups &mdash; and those in greatest need of dental care, will be screened, advised of the services available, educated in dental hygiene and referred for care as necessary.</P>
      <P>This, therefore, does not represent a curtailment in the service but rather it is a development that seeks to provide the optimum service to those in need.</P>
      <P>Emergency and scheduled maintenance services, of course, continue to be provided at Eastern Health Board health centres.</P>

      <P>The ratio of consultant paediatricians per thousand children aged 0-14 in Ireland is 0.06.  Comparisons with other European countries are difficult because of the absence of a standard definition of a consultant or specialist.  In addition, larger European countries may have a greater range of paediatric sub-specialisation making valid comparison even more difficult.</P>
      <P>Ireland compares favourably with our nearest neighbours in the United Kingdom where it is easier to make comparisons due to the similarity of the structure of the medical profession.  The relevant ratios are as follows: Ireland, 0.06; England and Wales, 0.08; Scotland, 0.09; Northern Ireland 0.05.</P>
      <P>The higher ratios in England and Wales and Scotland may be attributable in part to the fact that the complement of consultant paediatricians may not have fallen in line with the fall in the population in the 0-14 age group in those countries.</P>

Should a consultant feel that a patient's condition has deteriorated while on the waiting list and require <Col N="1225" /> immediate attention, they will receive the appropriate treatment as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most effective management of <Col N="1226" /> cancer in a modern health service involves a multi-disciplinary approach. Consultants dealing with treatment of cancer would be haematologists, radiologists-radiotherapists, oncologists and surgeons who would all be involved in the treatment of cancer related cases as part of their workload.  Each major general hospital would therefore be involved in dealing with cancer patients in the first instance.  Where further more specialised treatment is required the patients are referred to specialist units such as those mentioned below.  Increasingly, major surgery is a high technology procedure often necessitating a team of surgeons from different specialties and also requiring close co-operation with the diagnostic specialties.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we have a national radiotherapy service provided at St. Luke's-St. Anne's Hospital in Dublin and at Cork Regional Hospital.  Last year my Department made capital funds of approximately £480,000 for the purchase of a new cobalt unit in Cork.  Considerable investment, both state and voluntary, has been made in recent yeas in the radiotherapy unit at Cork Regional Hospital with the provision of a linear accelerator at a total cost of over £873,000.</P>
      <P>Bone marrow transplantations, a key element in the treatment of leukaemia, is carried out at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  Provision has been made in this year's capital programme to provide for the development of a new bone marrow oncology unit a St. James's hospital.</P>
      <P>A new unit for oncology patients at Crumlin was opened last October at a total cost of £1.7 million and funding has been allocated to bring this unit into full service in 1992.</P>
      <P>Charities and voluntary agencies play a very valuable part in the approach to cancer treatment in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, charities such as Aid Cancer Treatment in Cork and the Children's Cancer Research and Development Fund Committee in Our <Col N="1227" /> Lady's Hospital have been particularly successful in raising funds to enhance and complement the publicly funded services.</P>

The data collection commenced in the greater Dublin area in 1990.  The coverage is being extended on a phased basis and the Southern Health Board were asked to nominate a co-ordinator for the project last summer.  The co-ordinator is now assisting the Health Research Board in the completion of treatment data, an important indicator of drug misuse, which will be available retrospectively from the beginning of 1992.  The Dublin data base collects information from a range of indicators which include persons charged for drug offences, seizures of illicit drugs, AIDS/HIV data, drug-related hepatitis <Col N="1228" /> B cases and drug-related deaths.  It is the intention to extend these indicators, where appropriate, to the Southern Health Board as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>There are 34 permanent speech therapy posts in the Eastern Health Board area. Five of these are currently vacant and the Eastern Health Board have made a number of unsuccessful attempts to fill them.  At present the equivalent of 3.5 speech therapists are employed in the Tallaght area.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are difficulties about the level of speech therapy provision in certain areas of the country.  I intend to establish a group to review the services for people with physical disabilities. The provision of speech therapy will be considered in that context.</P>

The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989 limit first time applicants for a driving licence for a motor cycle to a category A1 licence which covers motor cycles of 125 c.c. or less.  To be eligible for a provisional licence for a more powerful machine, a person must have held a full category A1 licence for at least two years.

      <P>My Department issued a circular to planning authorities last January asking them, <i>inter alia,</i> to make it their objective to decide planning applications within the statutory two month period and only in exceptional circumstances to seek further information.  Where such further information is necessary, planning authorities were asked to seek it as soon as possible after the receipt of application and to decide the application, as far as possible within one month of receipt of such further information.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present for an amendment of the statutory period for determining a planning application.  I will, however, be monitoring the response to the January circular and will, if necessary, bring forward further measures to speed up the processing of applications at local level.</P>

      <P>As this road will not form part of the network of national roads, the timing of construction work on it is primarily a matter for Dublin County Council.  The cost of the work would normally fall to be financed by the local authority from their own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants for regional and county roads.  In the current year, these grants total £1.382 million.  Special road grants have been provided towards the cost of two sections of the road, Fonthill-Neilstown and Nangor Road-Boot Road, including £200,000 this year in respect of the latter section.</P>

      <P>The Government have on several occasions made clear their concerns regarding the use of lethal force by the Northern Ireland security forces.  The matter has been raised at several meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  In particular, attention has been drawn to specific incidents in which individuals have been killed by the Northern Ireland security forces in circumstances which had given rise to controversy or public concern.  As the Deputy is aware, there are prosecutions pending against members of the British Army in a number of recent cases and in a number of others the police investigations are proceeding. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on those cases at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the more general questions involved, the Government have called for a thorough examination of the whole area of the use of lethal force by <Col N="1243" /> the security forces in Northern Ireland, including the investigative process in such cases and the adequacy of the existing law to meet the clear needs of the situation. The British authorities have indicated that they are willing to consider the possibility of a change in the law and that the subject is receiving close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to seek progress on this very important issue which goes to the heart of public confidence in the law and the security forces in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>In 1979, when Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the Irish Government recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the <Col N="1244" /> sole legal Government of China.  Diplomatic relations are conducted with China on that basis.  At that time, Tibet was recognised internationally as part of the People's Republic.  That situation remains unchanged.  The question therefore of recognising Tibet as an independent and sovereign state does not arise.</P>
      <P>A central concern of Government policy on Tibet remains nevertheless the respect and protection of the human rights of Tibetans.  Our concern and those of our partners in the Community at the continuing reports of abuses in Tibet have been and continue to be brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities. As recently as 20 February 1992 at the regular session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the Presidency, on behalf of the member states of the Community, called once again on China to guarantee respect for human rights, in accordance with its international obligations.  This call included a specific reference to respect for human rights in Tibet.  While a draft resolution on human rights in China, including Tibet, failed on a procedural motion, the discussion at the Human Rights Commission served to ensure that the situation of Tibet and the human rights of Tibetans were once again brought to the fore.</P>

      <P>I understand that the returns from the 1991 census in Britain will begin to appear from next month and that information regarding persons born in Ireland will be made public in due course.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of ethnic classification the Deputy will be aware that the Irish were not among the groupings listed for ethnic classification in that census.  He will recall that there were differing views within the Irish community on the desirability of a separate listing.  The question of commissioning data relating to those who nevertheless identified themselves on the census form as of Irish ethnicity is under active consideration. While all useful information on the Irish community in Britain is to be welcomed, as the Deputy will appreciate, this data may not give an accurate representation of the Irish community in Britain, given the self-definition required.</P>

      <Quest>whether, in light of the enormous suffering of Cambodians from the presence of hundreds of thousands of landmines in their country, this country supports the call for an international ban on the manufacture, possession, transfer, sale and use of landmines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government shares the Deputy's concern in this matter.  The widespread presence of landmines throughout the Cambodian countryside is undoubtedly a considerable hazard for the local inhabitants and a major obstacle to the safe return of the thousands of refugees from Thailand to Cambodia. This very serious problem is fully recognised by the international community and by the United Nations.  The UN is taking steps to ensure that border crossings and routes are cleared of mines and other hazards, in accorance with the terms of the Comprehensive Political Settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United National convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or <Col N="1247" /> to have indiscriminate effects, which was opened for signature in 1981, prohibits the indiscrimate use of mines in particular in areas where there is a high concentration of civilians.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a signatory of this convention and strongly supports its provisions.</P>
    <P>The Government believe firmly in the need for restraint in the manufacture, possession, transfer and sale of all conventional weapons.  The European Council in Luxembourg in June 1991 adopted a Declaration on Non-Proliferation and Arms Exports which expressed the European Council's alarm at the stockpiling of conventional weapons in certain regions of the world and the council's belief that far-reaching international action was needed immediately to promote restraint and transparency in the transfers of conventional weapons and of technologies for military use, in particular towards areas of tension.</P>
    <P>Together with her European Community partners and Japan, Ireland tabled a resolution at the United Nations last year which called for the establishment of a United Nations register of armaments which would initially include information on transfers of certain categories of conventional weapons.  Later on, it is envisaged that the register will be expanded to include other information on armaments and the categories of armaments to which the register applies may also be extended.  The Government would welcome the inclusion of landmines in the scope of the register and will give serious consideration to such a proposal at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>Funds for immigrant groups in the US were provided by the Government for the first time in 1990.  The sum allocated in that year was £200,000 and the same amount was allocated in 1991.  The sum provided in this year's Book of Estimates is £50,000; this reduction in the allocation was reluctantly made by the Government in the light of the difficult budgetary situation and the need to find savings wherever possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the announcement of the 1992 allocation, I have received representations from, among others, Catholic <Col N="1249" /> charities and the Emerald Isle Advice Centre, both in New York, and the Irish Immigration Center in Boston.  During my recent visit to New York, in the course of which I met representatives of immigrant groups and visited the Bronx Young Irish Centre, I had an opportunity to assess the situation at first hand.  In the light of my discussions in the US.  I propose to explore further what scope may exist for additional funding of immigrant groups in the current year.</P>
    <P>Funding for immigrant groups in Britain is provided by the Department of Labour through the DION Committee which operates under the aegis of the Irish Embassy, in London.  An amount of £250,000 per annum was disbursed in 1987, 1988 and 1989; this figure increased to £500,000 per annum in 1990 and 1991. A sum of £500,000 has been provided by the Government in the current year.</P>

      <P>Ireland's already has diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation. These are conducted on its behalf by the Irish Embassy in Moscow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's network of diplomatic relations, both resident and non-resident, is small and must remain so for the foreseeable future, given our limited financial and personnel resources.  Possibilities for its extension are examined from time to time in the light of our national and international interests and the availability of the necessary resources.  It is established practice in <Col N="1250" /> regard to diplomatic relations to proceed only by agreement between the countries concerned.  Announcements are made by agreement at the appropriate time and it would be contrary to international practice to speculate publicly in advance of any such announcement.</P>

      <P>The number of permanent employees in Irish Sugar prior to privatisation i.e. as at 1 March 1991 was 1,636.  Since privatisation, Greencore plc is of course no longer a State-sponsored body under the aegis of my Department. However, in Greencore's 1991 Annual Report for year ended 30 September 1991, the average annual employment in the group for 1990-91 was given as 1,874. I understand that the current level of employment is about 2,000.</P>

      <P>Under Article 3.3 of Council Regulation No. 857/84, member states were obliged to establish a national reserve to cater for producers whose milk deliveries during the quota reference year (1983 in Ireland's case) were affected by animal disease or certain other exceptional factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national reserve for this purpose was established in Ireland in November 1984 when Exchequer funds of £5 million were made available to purchase seven million gallons for re-allocation to producers who qualified under the scheme.  The re-allocation <Col N="1259" /> of the entire seven million gallons available took place in early 1985.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 333 and 334 together.</P>
      <P>The basic Community Regulations governing the milk quota system are Council Regulations Nos. 856/84 and 857/84 together with the implementing Commission Regulation No. 1546/88. The national legislation is set down in S.I. No. 416 of 1985 as amended by S.I. Nos. 51 and 143 of 1987 and No. 49 of 1989.</P>
      <P>Quotas were allocated by my Department to co-operatives and dairies on the basis of the quantity of milk deliveries made to them in the calendar year 1983. Producers were in turn allocated quotas on the basis of the quantity of milk supplied by them during 1983.  Producers who did not deliver milk in 1983 would therefore not have been entitled to a basic quota unless they purchased or leased land from which milk was delivered in 1983 or qualified for an allocation from one of the national reserves which were set up for certain special category producers e.g., producers with animal disease problems, new entrants and participants in Community schemes for the non-marketing of milk.</P>

      <P>In December the Libyan authorities stated that they had no objection to the importation of boneless beef from Ireland.  Officials of my Department and of the Department of Foreign Affairs visited Tripoli in January for veterinary and trade discussions.  This resulted in the signing of a veterinary protocol on beef and dairy products and an agreement on wider trade and agricultural co-operation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 375 and 376 together.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Agriculture (Research Training and Advice) Act, 1988, provides that the first director of Teagasc shall be appointed and may be removed from office at any time by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Each subsequent director shall be appointed and may be removed from office at any time by Teagasc with my consent.</P>
      <P>In accordance with this procedure, the chairman of the board of Teagasc wrote to me on 4 March 1992 seeking my consent to the appointment of Dr. Liam Downey, whose term of appointment as director of ERAD expires on 31 March 1992, to be the director of Teagasc on the retirement of the current director, Dr. Pierce Ryan.  I have given my consent to this proposed appointment.  The contractual terms and conditions pertaining to the appointment will be considered by myself and the Minister for Finance at a future date.  I can assure the Deputies that the various procedures laid down in the 1988 Act will be complied with.</P>
      <P>I must point out to Deputies that at this stage, all that has happened is that Dr. Downey is returning to the body from which he was seconded when he was appointed director of ERAD.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that 29,000 tonnes of potatoes were imported into Ireland in the period March/June of last year; if he accepts that most of these imports could be eliminated if the storage capacity of Irish potato growers were to be increased; and if he intends to make further moneys available from the OPRD to enable farmers in this country to extend their storage capacity and to provide ancillary equipment so that the full demands of the Irish market can be adequately met from the native sources of supply.</Quest>

      <P>Grant aid amounting to £2.1 million has been approved under the Operational Programme for Rural Development (OPRD) (1991-93), which is funded jointly by the State and the EC.  Under the OPRD scheme for the potato sector, the Department has approved 137 projects, which will attract a total investment in the region of £5 million.</P>
      <P>The projects being aided are mainly for the provision of new storage, in insulation and ventilation of existing storage, and storage handling equipment.  My Department has estimated that investment under the OPRD scheme will provide additional storage capacity for 15,000 tonnes and improved storage for 30,000 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> There are no further moneys available under the scheme, which continues until the end of 1993.  Aid is also available for the potato sector under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 866/90 in respect of projects designed to improve the processing and marketing of agricultural products.  Under this scheme (1990-93) eight potato projects have been approved to date.  These include the provision of new storage for 13,000 tonnes and improved storage for 3,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The additional storage capacity and storage improvement being provided under both of these schemes should, when completed, enable producers to extend the marketing year for the Irish potato crop and thus reduce considerably our dependance on imports.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that although full payment can continue for six weeks after the death of a spouse in the case of a person in receipt of unemployment assistance which includes an adult dependant allowance, the pre-retirement allowance is reduced to single rate immediately upon death of an adult dependant; if he considers that this affords equitable treatment to persons who opt for pre-retirement allowance; the steps, if any, he will take to remove this anomaly from the social welfare code; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The arrangements for after-death social welfare payments were extended in last year's Social Welfare Act to include the continuation in payment of the adult dependant allowance for a person of six weeks after the death of an adult dependant.  This arrangement is a feature of benefits such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>There is no similar arrangement in the case of long term pension and allowance schemes, including pre-retirement allowance. The extension of the arrangement to the pre-retirement allowance would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

    <P>The resulting net yearly value of capital is added to any other direct income or earnings the pensioner may expect to receive during the coming year.  Where an old age pensioner is married, the means of both spouses are assessed, and each spouse is assumed to have half of the means of the couple.  The resulting aggregate amount is divided by 52, and £1 is added, to derive the weekly means.</P>
    <P>Weekly means up to £6 gives entitlement to the maximum rate of old age or widow's pension, which is currently £55 a week (increasing to £57.20 from the end of July 1992).  Pension is reduced by £2 for each £2 of weekly means above £6. Weekly means up to and including £58 gives entitlement or a minimum-rate pension of £3 a week.</P>
    <P>The maximum amount of savings (assuming no other means) which an old age pensioner or widow may have without receiving reduced pension is £2,987.50 in the case a single old age pensioner, £5,975 in the case of a married couple one of whom is a pensioner, and £5,400 in the case of a widow.</P>

      <P>Social insurance cover for old age and widow's pensions was extended to self-employed persons with effect from 6 April 1988.  The latest figures available relate to the contribution year 1989-90.  In that year some 125,000 self-employed persons paid social insurance contributions at the class S rate.  The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of farmers in this category is not available.</P>
      <P>The benefits payable under Class S are widow's contributory pension, orphan's contributory allowance and old age contributory pension.  Entitlement to widow's (contributory) pension can arise after the payment of three years contributions.</P>
      <P>In relation to old age contributory pension, those self-employed persons who became insured for the first time when social insurance for the self employed was introduced in 1988 and who reach pensionable age (66 years) on or after April 1998 will qualify, subject to the normal conditions.  Self-employed contributors who had been insured as employed contributors prior to becoming self employed can combine their earlier insurance to qualify for pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Providing entitlement to old age (contributory) pension to self-employed persons who, being over 56, enter social insurance for the first time in 1988 and who would have less than ten years contributions registered before pension age would have major cost implications.  The extra rate of contribution which would <Col N="1293" /> be required from self-employed contributions to provide old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 is estimated at 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment benefit on 16 January 1992.  Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition, <i>inter alia</i>, that the claimant must have at least 39 contributions, whether paid or credited, in the &ldquo;governing&rdquo; contribution year.  According to the records of my Department he has only 31 paid contributions at the appropriate rate during the period 6 April 1990 to 5 April 1991 which is the governing contribution year for his claim of 16 January 1992.</P>
      <P>He has now requested the local office for permission to sign the unemployed register retrospectively from January 1991 to March 1991 on the grounds that he was unemployed during the period. This request is being examined at present and he will be notified of the outcome at an early date.</P>

      <P>The part-time job incentive scheme is designed to allow long term unemployed persons to work part-time for up to 24 hours a week while receiving a flat rate allowance instead of their unemployment payments.  The scheme was introduced on a pilot basis in September 1986 and was extended nationwide at the end of 1988.  The allowances are currently £35 for a single person and £58 for a married person with a dependent spouse.  There are 323 persons participating in the scheme at present of which 25 reside in the Meath area.</P>
      <P>Persons accepted onto the scheme are taken off the live register and participation is limited to one year.  Surveys have shown that the comparatively low level of take-up may be attributable to the drop in transfer income participants may initially experience.  However, the combination of the allowance and the wages from the part-time job ensures that the participant is better off than if he or she had remained on the live register.</P>
      <P>I believe that this scheme has considerable potential as an incentive for long term unemployed people to get back into the workforce and I will be examining ways in which the scheme can be further developed and effectively promoted.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1977 makes unlawful, in relation to employment, certain kinds of discrimination on grounds of sex or marital status.  While the Act does not refer explicitly to sexual harassment, it has been successfully established that sexual harassment constitutes a form of discrimination prohibited under its provisions.  In a precedent case in 1985, the Labour Court ruled that freedom from sexual harassment is a condition of work which an employee of either sex is entitled to expect.  The court confirmed that it would treat any denial of that freedom as discrimination within the terms of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>An employee who considers that she/he is being or has been sexually harassed may, therefore, refer a complaint to the Labour Court under the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>In 1987, the Rubenstein report on the Dignity of Women at Work, which was prepared at the request of the European Commission, examined the legal protection in EC member states against sexual harassment at work.  It concluded that sexual harassment was contrary to the principle of equal treatment set out in Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion and working conditions.  It found, however, that Ireland was, at that stage, one of only two member states where there was a clear judicial acceptance that proven sexual harassment constituted sex discrimination.</P>
      <P>During the Irish Presidency of the EC Council of Ministers for Social Affairs, and at the initiative of the Irish Presidency, a Resolution on the Protection of the Dignity of Women and Men at Work was adopted in May 1990.  As a direct result of the adoption of this resolution, the European Commission undertook the preparation of a recommendation and a code of practice on the subject which were published on 4 December 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> The Council of Social Affairs Ministers of the European Communities on 29 November 1991 issued a Council Declaration on the implementation of the Commission recommendation on the protection of the dignity of women and men at work, including the code of practice to combat sexual harassment.  In the declaration, the Council endorses the general objective of the Commission Recommendation and invites the member states to develop and implement coherent, integrated policies to prevent and combat sexual harassment at work.</P>
    <P>My Department are pursuing consultations with the Employment Equality Agency, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers regarding the implementation of this code.</P>
    <P>While the guarantee of legal redress for victims of sexual harassment is essential, I believe that it is most important that employers and trade unions, while acknowledging the availability of legal redress to victims of sexual harassment, should put policies and procedures in place at company level to enable such issues to be handled without the need to resort to legal remedies.</P>
    <P>I know that this preventive approach is endorsed by the EEA, FIE and ICTU, all of whom have devised material for employers and employees regarding the development of policy and the handling of complaints.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question arises from a recent newspaper article concerning a report about the receivership of the company in question. However, the reference in the report to a sum of £164,467 is not to a sum owed <Col N="1306" /> by the Department but to money paid by the Department to the receiver from the social insurance fund.  That payment was made to the receiver in respect of the outstanding entitlements of former employees to arrears of wages, holiday pay and minimum notice compensation under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991.</P>
      <P>In addition, the records of my Department show that the company owes the social insurance fund a further sum of £40,662 in respect of redundancy lump sums paid to the former employees under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 1991.</P>

The business being established under the enterprise scheme must be potentially viable and be full-time and independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for participation in the scheme an individual has to be unemployed and signing on the live register, and be getting unemployment <Col N="1309" /> assistance/unemployment benefit/disability benefit for 13 weeks immediately beforehand.  Attending a training course qualifies for part of the 13 weeks.</P>
    <P>Through its co-operative unit and community enterprise programme FÁS offers financial assistance to groups prepared to set up enterprises.  Support services provided through these programmes include: flexible training packages for what the group needs at various stages of development; development grants for product investigation and group development; enterprise worker grants &mdash; to employ an enterprise worker to develop specific business ideas to the point of start-up; commercial aid grant towards management costs; and commercial aid grant in the form of wage subsidies for commercially viable projects in manufacturing and selected services sectors. Advice and access to other State supports are also offered.</P>
    <P>FÁS also operates the employment incentive and subsidy schemes which provide assistance to employers, including small businesses, to recruit additional staff through the payment of subsidies. The incentive scheme encourages the recruitment of long term unemployed persons, early school leavers and other disadvantaged persons through the payment of a subsidy of £60 or £45 for 39 weeks.  The recently introduced subsidy scheme encourages the recruitment of persons who have been on the live register for at least eight weeks through payment of a subsidy of £54 for 52 weeks provided the recruit is retained in employment for 78 weeks.</P>
    <P>CERT assistance is provided by means of its business start-up scheme which helps persons interested in setting up enterprises to test and launch new tourism and catering businesses.</P>

      <P>NOW is a European Community initiative which aims to promote equal opportunities for women in the field of employment and vocational training in the period to end-1993.  The Department of Labour as the designated national authority for the European Social Fund appointed a national co-ordinator and support structure for the NOW initiative as required by the Commission of the European Communities.  The national co-ordinator is an official of the Department of Labour, the designated support structure is the Council for the Status for Women.</P>
      <P>The NOW operational programme for Ireland was agreed by the Euopean Commission in December 1991.  The selection of projects to be funded under the programme is being completed.</P>
      <P>Twenty three project sponsors have been given financial assistance to further develop their proposals.  Decisions on the funding of projects up to the end of 1993 will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>Due to the very large number of applications and the limited funding available under NOW, it is not envisaged that further applications will be sought under the current Community Support Framework.</P>
