      <P>In an address to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 4 May last, President Mitterrand proposed that biennial meetings should be held of the Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe, to alternate with the Summit meetings of the CSCE.  It has now been decided to hold a Council of Europe Summit on 8-9 October 1993.  The Summit will take place in Vienna, as Austria will at that time hold the Council of Europe's Presidency. It is my intention to attend the Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the French President's initiative for a Council of Europe Summit.  With the disappearance of the Communist bloc, enormous changes have taken place in the political landscape of Europe.  It is, therefore, appropriate <Col N="1722" /> that European organisations should re-examine their roles and consider how best they can contribute to the creation of stability in the new Europe that has emerged from the end of the Cold War.  The Council of Europe has a significant part to play in this regard.  It has the important task of assisting the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe to develop their democratic infrastructures and to integrate into Europe's wide network of governmental and parliamentary co-operation.</P>
    <P>Already Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, Poland and Bulgaria have been admitted as full members of the Council of Europe and applications from a number of other Central and Eastern European countries are under consideration.  Next year's Vienna Summit is intended to give the necessary political direction to the Council and to assist it in making its contribution, along with other European organisations, to the task of helping the new European democracies become an effective part of the peaceful and productive pattern of European co-operation.</P>
    <P>However, I am strongly of the view that for the Summit to be successful it will have to be very carefully planned and prepared.  Over the coming months we will be co-operating with other members of the Council of Europe to ensure this. Finally, I believe that the question of holding further meetings of Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe can best be decided following the outcome of next year's Vienna Summit.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that, within the European Community there is a constant, ongoing conflict between the needs of widening the Community and deepening it and that one way of avoiding that conflict would be by giving an enhanced role to the Council of Europe?  Would he agree also that if the Council of Europe is to become an effective body there needs to be a change to the treaty establishing it to prevent the situation continuing whereby an individual member state of the 27 can block a convention from coming into <Col N="1723" /> operation, even though it has agreed to the convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a need not alone to widen but to deepen the European Community.  The appropriate expert groups within the Council of Europe have been examining for some time ways of streamlining the supervisory mechanism of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is desirable that the Community should be widened and deepened.  There are applications to be dealt with shortly relating to enlargement to include some of the EFTA countries and other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it is an aspect that will have to be examined as we look at the number of states which want to become members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Deputy is referring not only to our original Programme for Government 1989-1993 in the national interest but also to the commitments contained in the review published last autumn.  As has been stated on several <Col N="1724" /> occasions, the vast majority of the original commitments have either been implemented or are in the process of implementation.  As a result, it was possible in many cases to set new priorities in the review last year.  The Government are making good progress on a wide front.</P>
    <P>All the main macro-economic objectives have been fulfilled.  The debt-GNP ratio is now close to 100 per cent of GNP, the revised target for 1993 instead of the 120 per cent target originally set.  The standard rate of tax has been brought down to 27 per cent.  Much progress has been made in reducing the tax wedge in recent budgets.  We have maintained a stable exchange rate policy, especially over recent weeks.  Job creation targets for the industrial promotion agencies have been largely fulfilled, despite an adverse international climate.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Education has been published, and the third level grants scheme has been radically overhauled and improved.  The plan for social housing is being implemented.  The living standards of social welfare recipients have been more than maintained.  Common Agricultural Policy reform did have full regard for Ireland's special position, and did take account of the interests and well being of farmers and consumers alike, and does safeguard the fabric of rural society.  Widescale Oireachtas reform has been introduced, or is under active consideration. The White Paper on Marital Breakdown has been published.  Most of the other legislation promised has either been already passed, introduced, or at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>I announced in the course of my Bodenstown speech that there would be an increase in ODA from next year.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht European Council created no obstacles to Ireland's participation in the front rank of European nations, and the commitments to cohesion and the Delors II proposals based on them are very satisfactory. There are good expectations that the new Cohesion Fund will be established as from some time next year.</P>
    <P>We have succeeded in relaunching dialogue in Northern Ireland, and are working <Col N="1725" /> for a positive result.  A long paper was published last summer on the potential of North-South economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the Government have undertaken many initiatives that are not in the programme, that derive from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> or because particular needs have arisen.  Looking at the programme, therefore, only gives a partial view of the Government's activity.  Equally, not every measure outlined in the programme has proved possible to implement in the exact form envisaged or can be regarded as a major priority. All such political programmes have to be implemented pragmatically, depending on what is feasible and desirable, and taking account of other priorities, with the final criterion being one's best judgment as to what is in the national interest at a particular time.</P>
    <P>The high degree to which policy aims and commitments have been implemented by Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1987 compares most favourably with the many broken pledges of the preceding period.  If the Deputy cares to look back and see how little of the 1982-1987 Fine Gael-Labour Coalition's Joint Programme for Government was ever implemented, he will fully appreciate how much better this Government have done.</P>
    <P>With a new Government being formed last February, causing some postponement of a meeting due, the monitoring committee held its first meeting on 29 April.  A further meeting was arranged in July which unfortunately had to be cancelled, because of other engagements. That meeting is now planned to take place shortly, but in any case the power of decision in relation to the implementation of the various parts of the programme obviously rests with the Government as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that in stark contrast to the rather glowing picture he paints, this is a four-year programme and we are now well into the fourth year of the term of office of this Government.  Would the <Col N="1726" /> Taoiseach not agree that the employment creation element is a flop and that we have 300,000 people out of work, that public liability insurance which was supposed to be reformed and improved has not been changed, that the hospital waiting lists have increased by 10 per cent, that the standardised means test has not been introduced, that the special priority that was to be given to deal with the massive housing crisis has not been reflected in the programme for social housing, and that, in fact, it is a farce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the capitation grant which was supposed to be improved has rested at £28 for primary schools for the past five years and that, in addition, far from reforming the higher education grants, the Taoiseach has dismantled the system?</P>

Deputy Higgins has not asked a question that I have to answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Among the items listed by the Taoiseach in relation to the Programme for Government was the question of the Programme for Social Housing.  I put it to the Taoiseach that as a programme to solve the housing problems, it is totally inadequate.  Given the growing housing lists and the inadequate response of the Government, would the Taoiseach not agree that the Government should review that aspect of the programme with a view to building houses?  The waiting lists are longer than ever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the social housing programme was slow in getting off the ground and many local authorities did not make any real effort to initiate it in the early stages.  However, I assure the Deputy that the Minister for the Environment is carrying out a review of its progress and undoubtedly, he will report back to Government in due course on this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible, at this stage, to provide definitive information on the number of local <Col N="1735" /> authority dwellings which will be started and completed in 1992.  The indications are, however, that some 1,300 starts and some 1,500 completions, including acquisitions, will be achieved.</P>
      <P>The capital provision for the 1992 local authority house construction programme provides for 1,000 new &ldquo;starts&rdquo;, and, in addition, caters for some 550 houses which were approved to commence in 1991 but which local authorities did not get to construction stage by the end of that year.</P>
      <P>Returns on their housing operations, including the house construction programme, are made by local authorities on a quarterly basis.  The latest complete return in relation to housing completions has been published in the Housing Statistics Bulletin, June Quarter 1992, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library.  This indicates that 530 completions had been achieved by the end of June, 1992.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously telling me that although these returns are made on a quarterly basis, he cannot give us any more information than is available for the first half of the year?  If in the first half of the year 530 houses have been completed, how do the Government expect that 1,500 will be completed for the rest of this year?</P>

If 530 houses were completed in the first half of the year how does the Minister pretend that 1,000 houses will be completed in the second half of the year?  How can the Minister pretend that, and then tell me that he has not got any up-to-date information? Is the Minister not just bluffing on this?</P>

      <P>If we find that completions this year are equivalent only to the number of houses held over since last year then it is clear that the programme is not making any progress.  Will the Minister agree that it is a very strange situation when less than one-third of the total capital allocation for local authority housing this year is being made available directly by the Government&mdash;£18.5 million out of a total of £41.5 million?  The local authorities are actually providing the bulk of this from there own capital resources.  Would the Minister agree that 1,500 houses, even if we reach that, is a very small figure when we find one local authority&mdash;I am referring to Dublin Corporation&mdash;saying that 90 per cent of their housing applicants, the people who will have to be housed out of these 1,500 that will be completed, have estimated gross incomes of less than £8,000 per annum and over 80 per cent of those people have incomes of less than £6,000 per annum?  Will the Minister agree that even if we reach his targets for this year, which I seriously doubt, this programme is only a flea bite compared to the total needs?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Directive 91/328/EEC of 21 June 1991, requires those member states, including Ireland, which do not have a system of regular roadworthiness testing for cars already in operation to have such a system fully operational by 1 January 1998.  It is intended to publish a discussion document, as soon as possible, on the implementation of the directive in Ireland.  It would not be appropriate to anticipate the contents of this document pending its finalisation by the Government. Concerns such as those expressed in the questions will, of course, be taken fully into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that certain requirements here will have to be fulfilled before this directive can be imposed on the Irish motorist? Would the Minister also agree that if car prices had been reduced to the European average, which was supposed to have been achieved in 1992, this would make things easier for car owners?  Car <Col N="1738" /> insurance on the Continent costs about half what it does here.  There is a lack of public transport in most rural areas here which is not the case in most continental countries.  Therefore, all families depend on a car.  The state of our roads, particularly our county roads, is deplorable.  If these were kept to the standard at which they are kept on the Continent perhaps we would not need road tests on cars. The cost of this test at about £45&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of five countries&mdash;Ireland, Denmark, France, Portugal and Italy&mdash;all other European member states have compulsory roadworthiness testing. Obviously economic factors have to be taken into account.  However, it is just a question of economics but essentially a matter of road safety.  For example, in 1990 the Garda initiated 43,000 prosecutions in Ireland in respect of vehicle defects.  These included faulty brakes, lights, bald tyres and so on.  As Foras Forbartha indicated in 1975 that 8 per cent of all fatal accidents were as a result of defective vehicles.  It is important, certainly from a road safety point of view, that we have testing of vehicles in Ireland.  It is also important from a environmental point of view to prevent noise from defective vehicles or additional emissions into the atmosphere disimproving air quality as a result of vehicles emissions equipment not being in order.  Those factors have to be taken into account and the Government will certainly do that in the context of the discussion document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Society for the Irish Motor Industry have recommended this.  The Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i><Col N="1739" /> have recommended this as have the task force on employment.  It has been suggested that perhaps 1,100 extra jobs would be created, 300 in vehicle testing and 800 in follow-up repair work although, since there is some under employment in the motor industry, I am not certain that there will be 1,100 additional jobs.  The cost of testing a vehicle is estimated at about £30 and not £45 as the Deputy suggested.</P>

      <P>Will we see a greater effort to put our roads into good order, particularly country roads which are attacting no money from the Department of the Environment?  The state of our roads is the reason cars are in such a lamentable state and relatively new cars are being wrecked.  The white lines have disappeared from the roads.  Local authorities cannot afford to maintain the roads.  Surely the first priority of the Department of the Environment should be to make our roads safe before telling everybody else to expend large sums of money which many have not got so that we can comply with a directive.</P>

      <P>Staffing of the Environmental Protection Agency is a matter for determination by the agency, subject to the consent of the Ministers for the Environment and Finance as to numbers and grading.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 provides for a variety of means for staffing the agency.  It has already been indicated that it is intended to transfer the staff of the Environmental Research Unit who are engaged in environmental functions, as well as the regionally based remaining staff of An Foras Forbartha, into the new agency but this and other such transfers will require consultation with the agency, other public authorities concerned, and the unions-associations representing staff concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Act also provides for staff to be seconded or transferred to the agency from local authorities?  In that event, could the Minister of State tell us how the local authorities will carry out the functions that the Environmental Protection Agency will be requiring them to carry <Col N="1741" /> out?  Will the Minister indicate whether there is any intention to make any net addition to the resources that we have to achieve the kind of objectives that underly the Act?  If there will be no net extra staff where are we going to see the extra environmental protection coming from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that section 30 of the Act allows for the transfer to the agency of staff not just from local authorities but from public authorities generally. However, it is not envisaged that we will not have additional staff.  We will have additional staff employed by the agency, particularly in those specialised areas where we do not currently have satisfactory staffing resources.</P>
      <P>One of the main functions of the agency is to carry out a licensing system, and a centrally based agency bringing together a small number of staff would be able to do that far more effectively than having these resources in every local authority such as is the case at the moment.  Local authorities in Ireland have 30,000 people employed.  Earlier we heard reference to the fact that there are housing and road problems and it is a question for local authorities, in some instances, to redeploy staff from areas where they are not in as much use now as they might have been in the past so that high priority can be given to environmental protection.  There is an enormous staff resource in the country generally. It compares very favourably with many countries which have a similar local government system and I do not believe shortage in the environmental area as a result of that.  The streamlined measures and the expertise that will be available to the agency centrally will be of great help to local authorities because at the moment many local authorities have to employ consultants in processing planning applications and licensing permits. Obviously, they will have no need to do this once the agency are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that there are very few local <Col N="1742" /> authorities which would regard themselves as being in any way overstaffed in the areas of expertise covered by the Act? Now that she has said that extra resources will be made available would she indicate the areas it is expected these extra people will cover and from where they might come?  Will they be recruited within the country or from outside and what kind of people will they be?  Would the Minister of State indicate on what the £710,000 is being spent this year in preparing for the setting up of the agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me answer the Deputy's last question first.  As I indicated during the course of the Adjournment debate the other evening when the Deputy raised this issue, the Department are upgrading the regional laboratories which will be taken over by the agency. With support under the Stride programme, we are starting a new environmental research fund which will be operated by the agency and in the process of finalising with the European Community a new data information project which, again, will be used by the agency. Given that they will be an independent body, in so far as it is appropriate, many of the housekeeping matters are being attended to &mdash; that is where the £750,000 is being spent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked from where the new staff will come.  I cannot specify exactly where they will come from but in relation to dangerous and toxic waste, for example, the agency will be licensing technical processes in the chemical, pharmaceutical and high-tech industries so specialised staff with qualifications in toxicology and expertise in that area which is in short supply in the country will be required.  Where needed, this is often hired in from the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of staffing, many of the staff will be redeployed from within the existing public sector and the environmental unit within my Department. Obviously, staff will be recruited both within the country and from outside.  In any event, we are required under European provisions to advertise staff vacancies of this kind, widely in European <Col N="1743" /> bulletins and so on and such advertisements will obviously be carried.  I envisage that people both within the country and from outside, from the public and private sectors will apply.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have not heard any local authority say that they have an abundance of staff.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard but the local authorities have enormous staff resources of 30,000 people and from the point of view of environmental protection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not talking about putting them into the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Deputy asked that if we remove some of their expertise will the local authorities have anybody left to carry out environmental protection work.  Much of the shortfall in the area of environmental protection at the moment arises from the fact that the local authorities do not have sufficient people on the monitoring and enforcement side, be it in the area of litter control or of monitoring water quality.</P>

      <P>I am aware of this report which deals with the full range of services needed by the homeless.  My Department's responsibility lies in the area of the provision of accommodation which is comprehensively addressed in <i>A Plan for Social Housing.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of homeless persons has been significantly improved by a number of initiatives taken in recent years.  The more significant of these include: wider powers, in addition to providing accommodation in local authority housing, conferred on local authorities by the Housing Act, 1988 to secure accommodation for homeless persons; assessments of housing needs undertaken by local authorities now specifically include homeless persons; more flexible financial arrangements <Col N="1746" /> have been introduced when voluntary bodies provide accommodation for homeless persons and there is increased Exchequer funding for this purpose; better liaison between housing authorities and voluntary bodies providing accommodation for homeless persons; improved arrangements to provide an emergency response service for homeless persons; new schemes of letting priorities adopted by housing authorities under the Housing Act, 1988 give greater prominence to homeless persons; and the level of capital assistance available to voluntary bodies providing accommodation for, <i>inter alia</i>, homeless persons has been increased substantially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that far from improving the position is getting worse and that it is unacceptable in a Christian country such as this that the position in relation to the homeless is getting worse at an alarming rate?  Is he aware, for example, that the hostels in Dublin city are overcrowded and that between 1990 and 1992 the number of bednights in bed and breakfast accommodation has increased to a startling 5,245 in the Eastern Health Board area?  Finally, would the Minister of State agree that the only real solution to the problem of homelessness in this city and the country in general is for the Minister and his colleagues in cabinet to restart the public house building programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to voluntary bodies throughout the country for the work they are doing in trying to meet the needs of the homeless and many other sectors of our community.  Nowhere else in the world would you find people who are so committed.  Irrespective of what may be said, we could not provide the service were it not for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept, however, that the position has not improved because it has. Increased resources have been provided. For instance, in Dublin Focus Point have provided 96 units at Stanhope Green while 155 units have been provided at Iveagh House hostel.  In addition, the <Col N="1747" /> Salvation Army at Granby Place, Dublin and the Simon Community in both Dublin and Cork have also provided units.  Every effort is being made in close co-operation with my Department.</P>
    <P>This is not just a problem for the Department of the Environment; it is also a problem for the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  For this reason the co-ordinating body, with the Eastern Health Board and other relevant bodies, are monitoring the situation.  As a result of co-ordination and the close links between the voluntary and statutory bodies the position is improving.  I agree that more work must be done but I am satisfied that improvements are taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed the Minister is arguing that the position has improved. Would the Minister not agree that, even before the 3 per cent increase in mortgage rates, in the Eastern Health Board area alone 3,000 families were in receipt of mortgage supplements?  These people were one step away from homelessness.</P>

      <P>In acknowledging the Minister's tribute to the voluntary groups working with the homeless in Dublin and elsewhere, I would ask him to have regard to the reports published recently by the Simon Community and Focus Point on the deplorable condition of hostels for homeless people, particularly in the city of Dublin?  Second, would he take the time to visit some of the hostels that exist in Dublin whose inadequacies can only be realised by visiting them? All the steps referred to by the Minister relate to local authority house building and local authority co-operation.  Does the Minister not accept that the vast majority of people in hostels in Dublin and in his own city are permanent, if not semi-permanent, residents simply because there is nowhere else for them to go?  Close co-operation with local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the exception of the Custom House Docks area and the Temple Bar area in Dublin, the tax incentives available under the urban renewal scheme will expire on 31 May 1994 as provided for in the Finance Act, 1992.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to extend the scheme to the areas suggested or to review the criteria for designating areas under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  At 1 January 1992 the scheme had given rise to private sector investment of £773 million on development projects as follows: projects completed, £257 million; projects in progress, £136 million; projects in planning £380 million.</P>
      <P>This is in addition to the Custom House Docks project valued at some £400 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the area in question, the Bond Street-Marrowbone Lane area of Dublin 8, is particularly suited to the objectives set out in the renewal scheme in that there is a strong local sense of community in the area, there is already a mix of industrial, commercial and residential use there and it is an area that suffers from severe dilapidation, as the Minister will see if he makes even a brief visit there.  Would the Minister agree that this area conforms to the other clear criterion underlying the scheme, that is, its location very near the centre of the city which makes it suitable for residential, industrial and commercial development?  Would he not reconsider the matter in view of those very strong arguments in favour of the area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted that many other centres would benefit from designation.  However, to designate on a wide basis would be counter-productive as it would make the special rating and <Col N="1751" /> tax reliefs into standard ones.  Designation must be limited in order to avoid dissipating its effect.

Following completion of the Kilcullen by-pass, which is scheduled for 1994, through traffic on the N9 will be routed via the Naas by-pass, Newbridge by-pass and Kilcullen by-pass with the result that the existing road will serve local traffic only.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that people disqualified from driving in courts in this State are still legally able to drive in Northern Ireland; if he intends to make representations to have all driving disqualifications made mutually recognisable both north and south; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>A person holding an Irish driving licence and disqualified from driving in the State is required by law to surrender his or her driving licence and cannot therefore, legally drive anywhere on the basis of that licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A visitor to this country holding a Northern Ireland licence, or a licence issued in any other country, and who is disqualified from driving in our courts, is <Col N="1753" /> disqualified from driving in the State but may continue to drive outside the State on the basis of that licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that this matter was raised recently by a district justice in the Dublin area who expressed concern about the law being undermined in so far as there is not recognition of the ban in both parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the comments of the district justice but I know that if somebody is banned from driving in this jurisdiction the licence is withdrawn and, therefore, he or she cannot use it anywhere else.  However, I am aware that a person can go to Northern Ireland and, by virtue of simply using an address there and doing a test, get a licence and drive there, which is obviously causing difficulties.</P>
      <P>However, a proposed European Community Directive will come into effect in 1996 under which a member of the European Community will be able to hold a licence in only one member state and the member state may withdraw a licence &mdash; or refuse to grant a licence &mdash; if someone has had a licence withdrawn in another country or is the subject of restrictions in another country.  The directive will improve the situation as far as the problems which the Deputy highlighted are concerned.</P>
      <P>In addition, a working group at European level is looking at this matter &mdash; and I know there are special difficulties because of the border with Northern Ireland &mdash; but, from the point of view of this jurisdiction, we withdraw the licence when someone has been convicted and, therefore, nobody could use it in Northern Ireland.  I accept that it is relatively easy to get another licence in Northern Ireland, which obviously happens in some cases.  Ireland is participating in the working group which is examining the directive and I hope that, in time, the difficulties will be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">

      <P>In the meantime, is the Minister of State saying that contact <Col N="1754" /> cannot be made with her counterparts in Northern Ireland to establish mutually satisfactory arrangements in regard to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it is possible for contact to be made and I will suggest it to the Minister whose responsibility it is.  One of the difficulties is the fact that it is relatively easy to get a licence in Northern Ireland without establishing residence and they should be stricter in regard to whom they grant a licence so that people from the Republic cannot just use an address, do a test and get a licence to cover the period for which they are off the road here.  However, I will discuss the matter with the Minister who is at a meeting of the European Council today and perhaps he will take it up with his counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems related to this question is that it is very rare for a person who has been disqualified to surrender his or her driving licence unless, perhaps, it is unwittingly produced in court and it can be seen that he or she is disqualified.  The disqualification, as the Minister will appreciate, does not come into effect until 15 days after the court hearing to enable the person to appeal.  Many people never surrender the driving licence and continue to use it in this State but more particularly in Northern Ireland.  Will the Minister agree that co-operation is needed between the Garda and the RUC &mdash; to enable them to check on people driving in Northern Ireland with driving licences issued in the Irish Republic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that giving information in this and other instances is important.  However, people who do not surrender their licence are breaking the law and if they drive with that licence in Northern Ireland they are doing so illegally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Minister is not conceding the difficulties raised by the question because, while people might be breaking the law, nonetheless <Col N="1755" /> they are doing so and it is a question of the Garda and the RUC having the information to challenge such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be appropriate that information regarding disqualification of people from driving should be available to the Garda and the authorities in Northern Ireland.  It is probably a matter more appropriate for the Department of Justice but I will pursue the matter.</P>

      <P>I refer to the full statement on the outcome of UNCED which the Taoiseach made in reply to questions on 23 June and to the reply by the Minister for the Environment to Questions Nos. 20, 22, 28, 33 and 265 of the same date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Environment Action Programme will be the main vehicle for implementing the environment aspects of Agenda 21. My Department are finalising the second review of this action programme and particular account will be taken of the UNCED dimension.  This policy review, together with the major organisational initiative of the Environmental Protection Agency, will support some of the key objectives of UNCED, in particular that of sustainable development.  Adoption and implementation of the European <Col N="1756" /> Community's Fifth Environmental Action Programme will also assist this process.</P>
    <P>My Department are completing a national CO2 strategy in consultation with other interested Departments.  This will form part of the wider EC strategy directed at ratification and implementation of the Climate Change Convention by the Community and its member states.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works are responsible for the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity.  The Department of Foreign Affairs are pursuing implementation of the financial commitments arising from UNCED.  The overall response to UNCED will involve action by a range of other Government Departments and public bodies as well as by the non-governmental and private sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, while certain decisions were taken at the Rio conference on a global basis, local authorities normally are the bodies which are responsible for the implementation of such decisions?  Does the Minister have any plans in her Department to ensure that local authorities are given the necessary finance to carry out such programmes, bearing in mind that their staffing &mdash; particularly outdoors &mdash; has been decimated over the last few years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously everybody is looking for more money, particularly as far as environmental matters are concerned. We cannot separate the issue of local authority finances from the overall position in relation to local authority financing; this is the subject of a later question.  I am a member of the Government sub-committee on this issue and we are discussing the future of local authority financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously it is my wish that local authorities will always be in a position to fund the environmental matters required of them and, in that regard, they will have to find more imaginative ways to do so through the involvement of the private sector in some instances and through local charges and levies in others where <Col N="1757" /> they do not apply at present, towards the implementation of some environmental objectives which we all demand.  There is no easy way of cleaning up the environment. It requires to be paid for which can only be done by borrowing the money, raising it through central taxation or by local charges for particular services. Obviously we need a combination of central taxation and charges at local level as well as any moneys which might be forthcoming from European sources.</P>
    <P>In the context of the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty, I hope additional moneys through the Cohesion Fund will be made available for environmental projects in the four poorer regions of the Community which include Ireland.  That should greatly help some of the major infrastructural work which has to be done on water treatment.</P>

      <P>I wish to remind the Minister that none of the undertakings given in Rio is conditional on our having access to the Cohesion Fund.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, I shall paraphrase.  There are two statements in the declaration dealing with the discouragement or prevention of the relocation and transfer of substances that could cause severe environmental degradation and a reference to the internationalisation of environmental costs which clearly relate to situations such as those with which we are coming into contact, and into conflict, in Sellafield for example.  The declaration states clearly that states undertake to protect the environment by adopting the precautionary approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What action has been taken to implement those two parts of the declaration <Col N="1758" /> that can be related directly and specifically to Sellafield, and what remedial action do the Government propose to take now, having thrown out the precautionary principle in the Environmental Protection Agency, to give effect to it as required by the declaration of the Rio conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is not true that the Government threw out the precautionary principle.  The agency is required, as one of the six requirements in their licensing operations, to take into account the precautionary principle.  As I said in my comments on the Environmental Protection Agency, if we were to be really precautionary &mdash; and this is a widely used concept in the environmental area and is something to which I have given a lot of thought &mdash; virtually nothing would happen because almost all of man's activities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that aspect in a moment; almost all of man's activities, our sheer existence, place pressures on the environment; if we were to be really precautionary we probably would not exist at all.</P>
      <P>I now turn to this country's obligations under UNCED.  Obviously Agenda 21 is the main action agenda which requires us to achieve sustainable development.  The Environmental Protection Agency and the environmental action plan are part of the process to be used here towards achieving that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a long agenda on water pollution, sewage treatment and so on that will require the expenditure of substantial moneys, to which I referred in reply to the previous question.  Under the two conventions we signed, Ireland will make resources available.  For example, the European Community committed itself to three billion ECU towards Agenda 21 and the Taoiseach has already <Col N="1759" /> said in the House that Ireland will make a contribution of about £7 million over a two to three year period.</P>
    <P>The main consequences of the Rio conference are that the world's population is projected to increase by 100 million each year during the nineties; we are losing a third of the land affecting 850 million people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we are required to redeploy resources from the developed countries to the less developed countries &mdash; that matter was discussed in the House last week in the context of Overseas Development Aid &mdash; and this country has to play its part in that process, a greater part than it played in recent years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to make a bigger contribution towards alleviating the kind of poverty that puts huge pressure on less developed countries in terms of human need and the environment.  It is not true to say, as Deputy Dukes does, that we have already fallen down on this. The United Nations General Assembly next month will discuss the implementation of Agenda 21 and the UNCED conclusions, and will establish the sustainable development commission. Ireland will play its part in that context particularly through membership of the European Community.  Most of what has to be done in relation to UNCED will be done in a European-wide context.  While the limit on greenhouse gases and the bio-diversity convention must be dealt with locally and on a national basis, we have also agreed to implement many of these issues in a European-wide context, which is what we will be doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17, 41 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of progress by local authorities on each of the measures introduced in <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> are contained in the housing statistics bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Information in relation to 1991 will be found in the Annual Housing Statistics <Col N="1762" /> Bulletin, 1991, and the June 1992 bulletin gives the most up-to-date information currently available.  Similar information for the period up to 30 September 1992 will be contained in the next bulletin.</P>
    <P>The 1992 capital provision for the shared ownership scheme has been fully allocated to local authorities but there is scope to reallocate capital to any local authority that may require additional resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the shared ownership scheme has, in essence, been a failure and that the main reason is that applicants need reassurance regarding the long term value of the unpurchased equity of a house, in other words the part of a house that would be rented from the local authority?  If we were to go through a period of high inflation, this cost would get completely out of control.  Would the Minister not agree also that people are deterred by the vast volume of legal documentation involved?  The scheme advertised that applicants would require only £1,000 upfront, but the legal costs are capitalised, become part of the mortgage and have to be repaid over the term of the scheme, in other words, it is a hidden cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the scheme is a failure.  By 30 June 1992 local authorities had reported that more than 2,300 applications had been received.  Nearly 900 of those applications had been approved in principle and 181 transactions completed.  During the second quarter of 1992 there has been a considerable increase in activity under the scheme, with 112 transactions being completed in the period.  That compares to 46 completed transactions in the first quarter.  The capital allocation for the scheme is £35 million in 1992; in 1991 £1 million was spent.  The Department make allocations early in each year and monitor expenditure at intervals throughout the year.  However, the Department would not have the figure of the level of commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> In relation to the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Shea, the administration of the shared ownership scheme is the responsibility of local authorities.  It is their responsibility to ensure that the scheme is made available in their areas and that applicants are properly advised. The system is administered by county councils, county boroughs and the Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State does not concede that the scheme is a failure, would he at least accept that it is not producing results at the speed originally intended by Government?  In particular, would he accept that a national scheme designed to alleviate a massive housing need cannot be shaping up to its requirement when it produces a mere 181 completed transactions?</P>
      <P>Given the figures quoted earlier by Deputy Dukes, would the Minister accept, particularly in relation to the Dublin region where more than 90 per cent of the tenants who would be considered under the scheme are excluded because of income levels, because they are in receipt of social welfare payments or on an income level at which they could never qualify because of house prices in Dublin, that there is a need to build some variation into the scheme, if it is to work, to have consideration for the prices of houses in these areas.  I understand that other areas in the country, such as Galway, have similar difficulties and where the national income at social welfare level is fixed the scheme cannot operate effectively because of the very high price of houses in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat I do not accept that the scheme is a failure.  I would accept, however, that it was slow in getting off the ground and that in some local authority areas it could have been promoted to a greater extent.  I am satisfied &mdash; and I have given the figures for the last quarter &mdash; that the scheme is a good one and is giving people an opportunity, which they would not otherwise have, to purchase their homes.  I believe <Col N="1764" /> it is making an impact on the present housing shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps does the Minister of State propose to take to rectify an anomaly that has arisen in relation to shared equity?  For example, in the borough of Wexford where the agency for shared equity approval is the Wexford County Council and the agency for loan approval is Wexford Corporation, is a dual application required?  Some confusion concerning the actual processing of loans has caused great difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister comment on the fact that some local authorities, one of which is in the Kilkenny area, can accommodate social welfare recipients under the scheme because of low house prices?  Such a possibility cannot exist in areas where housing has a very high premium such as Dublin, Galway and other areas.  Is the Minister aware of the discrepancy that exists where a vast number of the potential applicants under this scheme are automatically disqualified because of income levels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1765" />
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We have ongoing meetings with county managers in relation to this scheme.  As I have indicated, we were disappointed that some areas were not promoting it.  I undertake to have the matter the Deputy raised examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that after almost two years the scheme is a failure as some local authorities have processed no application under this scheme, at least until recently?  Would he agree that it would be much more positive if the £35 million were allocated to local authorities for the purpose of building traditional local authorities houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that some local authorities have not been as positive in promoting the scheme as I would have liked.  I do not accept that the scheme is a failure.  Neither do I accept that the £35 million should be given to local authorities because we have a new approach in relation to the needs of housing today which is much wider. Local authorities are not the only people who should be building houses.  I am satisfied that the moneys being allocated in this area and other areas of the social housing plan are worth while and are helping to broaden the way in which we attend to the needs of the people in the community most in need of housing.  I am satisfied that the plan for social housing is doing that in a very positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not working.  The Minister cannot even tell us how many houses are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether the scheme was intended for families on social welfare?  Is he aware that in Dublin not a single family on social welfare has been able to avail of the scheme?  If that is the case will he examine the submission from Dublin Corporation in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is for people who have the ability to pay.  It is a scheme that has attracted people who <Col N="1766" /> could not take out a full mortgage; under this scheme they can.  There is no point in allowing people to take out a mortgage today when they will be on the housing list next week.  The principal criterion for eligibility is the ability of people to pay and local authorities must bear this point in mind.  As indicated already, some local authorities appear to give no discretion and I will have that examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the three major difficulties I outlined earlier in relation to the scheme are inherent in the scheme and have nothing to do with how the scheme is administered by local authorities?  Has the Minister any proposals in relation to the value of the unpurchased equity getting totally out of hand, in other words where the rented portion of the purchase price is affected by inflation over a period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy that the scheme is a failure. There are aspects of it we can examine and review and we will certainly do that. I repeat, I am satisfied that this is a good scheme.  It has given people an opportunity, which they would not otherwise have, to purchase a house of their own. Certainly the shared ownership scheme has done that in a very positive way but there are aspects of it we can review.</P>

      <P>It is agreed that business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m.?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that No. 10, in respect of the motion from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, be decided without debate? Agreed.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to No. 9, which is a time allocation motion in regard to the three constitution Bills, I propose that it should not be taken without debate but rather that a debate lasting no more than one hour be allowed on that subject.  The issues dealt with in the constitutional Bill are profoundly fundamental. They concern the right to life of women and the right to life of unborn children.  They are important issues of human rights and issues which have to be reconciled.  If the Government believe that these issues are important enough to put in a Constitution, surely they are important enough to be discussed in this House for a period longer than 16 hours. Rushing this sort of issue epitomises all that is wrong with politics in Ireland at present.  The politicians now in Government have found this issue &mdash; the substantive issue &mdash; too difficult to handle in this House.  They are afraid they might not bring all their members with them on the detail of the issue.  Instead they decide to dump the issue on the heads of the Irish people and into the hands of the courts rather than deal with it themselves as they are elected to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is profoundly wrong to impose an artificially abbreviated timetable for any debate on an amendment to the Constitution.  In amending the Constitution we are making a decision for the next generation of Irish people and not just for the term of one Government. When the 1937 Constitution was debated in this House no artificial timetable was imposed.  When amendments to that Constitution in regard to PR and in regard to membership of the European Community were debated in this House no artificial timetable was imposed on the debates here.  The only time in recent memory when an artificial timetable was imposed was in 1983 and it is significant that it is precisely because the House did <Col N="1887" /> not debate that issue properly that we now have to debate it again so soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe, Sir, that it is wrong to have a timetable of 3 December for his matter.  The House should have sufficient time to debate a matter as important as this over several weeks so that the appropriate consensus can be reached.  As far as this party are concerned we have sought reasonably to achieve consensus even within the artificial timetable imposed by the Government. Attempting to get this House to do its solemn business in such a way is wrong particularly when it affects the right to life of women and the right to life of unborn children.  It is wrong, it should not be done and this House should not agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to object in the strongest possible terms to the ordering of business under Item 3 today.  There are two grounds on which I want to object.  The first is in relation to the ordering of the 12th, 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.  My concern, and I have put this to the Taoiseach very strenuously, is that we are going down exactly the same path as we were forced down in 1983.  Everyone in this House will remember the division and the divisiveness that was caused by that debate and also the mess we are in because of it.  I have to say to the Taoiseach that what he is proposing in this House today is a major error in terms of constitutional development in this country.  Even at this late stage the Taoiseach should reconsider what he is doing.  It is his responsibility not to diminish the value of our Constitution.  What the Taoiseach is proposing today in terms of Second Stages of Nos. 3, 4 and 5 on the Order Paper is, I believe, not upholding his responsibility as the protector of our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly in regard to No. 9 on the Order Paper today this is a global motion in terms of ordering our business.  It is a <Col N="1888" /> new device which the Government have discovered in the past two years.  It is basically undemocratic and not in the best interest of how we should conduct our business.  I would urge the Taoiseach, on both counts, to reconsider what he is about to do and what would be the disastrous consequences of what he is putting before the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not going to listen to anything we say on this side of the House at this stage given that he was not prepared to add even an hour and a half to the debate tonight to enable some additional speakers to participate in what is a major change in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>The proposals before us will limit contributions, assuming each speaker takes their full 45 minutes on the Second Stage. This will limit to 14, out of 165 Deputies, the number of contributors from this House to the debate.  That is a disgrace. The Taoiseach who, on the one hand, declares that he is for openness and is anxious for consensus, is trying to mislead people both inside this House by proposing a guillotine in this way on this debate.  We are not dealing with a simple matter.  We are dealing with the lives and the health of women and they represent more than half of our population.  We have no right, as a House dominated by men to take this decision lightly.  It is a disgrace that the Taoiseach is insisting on forcing this debate through in a matter of three days.  I would urge him, even at this late stage, to reconsider because what he is doing, in effect, is building up anger outside this House in relation to what he is trying to do.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my disappointment that these Bills are to be railroaded through the House.  I am <Col N="1889" /> particularly disappointed with the time allocations.  I thought we made some progress in the Electoral Bill where we had 20 minute slots for speakers which was reasonable.  Now we have 45 minute slots, which, as Deputy McCartan has stated, will allow only 14 Members from this side of the House to contribute.  I consider this is gravely injurious to me and to the other Independent Deputies.</P>

There is a long and proud tradition here which regards the right to life as belonging to the unborn as well as to those who have been born.  This respect for the sanctity of unborn human life was enshrined in Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution in 1983 by referendum of the people.  The provision declares that:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its law to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1983 abortion was, of course, prohibited here by section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which makes it an offence to unlawfully use any means with intent to procure a miscarriage.  Section 58 is still the relevant provision of our criminal law.</P>
    <P>If one were to try to summarise what was the purpose which those who proposed and voted for the amendment of the Constitution in 1983 had in mind, one could perhaps put it most succinctly by saying that the amendment was designed to preserve the prohibition on unlawful abortion contained in the 1861 Act.</P>
    <P>In its decision in the X case on 5 March of this year the Supreme Court gave its interpretation of Article 40.3.3º on both the substantive issue of abortion and on the right to travel out of the State to have an abortion.</P>
    <P>The effect of the decision on the substantive issue is that termination of pregnancy is permissible in the State where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by such termination and that a risk of suicide may constitute a real and substantial risk. That is the test laid down by the Supreme Court.  The court also decided by a three to two majority that, while an injunction will not be given to restrain a woman from travelling abroad to obtain an abortion where there is a real and substantial risk to her life, such an injunction can be <Col N="1895" /> given to restrain travel abroad to obtain an abortion where there is no such risk.</P>
    <P>The issue of information and counselling did not come before the Supreme Court in the X case but in previous cases that court decided that the dissemination of information on abortion is unlawful having regard to Article 40.3.3º.  One effect of the decision in the X case appears to be that it is not unlawful to communicate information to women who would be entitled to a termination of pregnancy under the decision.</P>
    <P>The decision has generated a very wide debate and concern about its implications. Initially, much of the debate focused on the implications of the decision for Protocol No. 17 to the draft Maastricht Treaty.  The reason that Protocol had been written into the Treaty was that, since EC law takes precedence over any conflicting provision of the Constitution, there were fears that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 40.3.3º, abortion might be imposed on this country under EC law.  To meet those fears Protocol No. 17 was annexed to the Maastricht Treaty.  I will be coming back to Protocol No. 17 later on.</P>
    <P>The Government took immediate action to address the issues raised by the decision in the X case.  On 10 March 1992 a Cabinet sub-committee was established under my chairmanship of examine the implications of the judgment.  The Government subsequently decided, on 10 April 1992, that a referendum should be held on the right to travel and the right to information, covering not only EC citizens and countries but all persons and countries, and that the other issues arising from the Supreme Court's judgment would be considered for legislation and/or referendum depending on the Government's decision on recommendations of the sub-committees.</P>
    <P>On 9 June 1992, prior to the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty the party leaders of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats subscribed to a statement to the following effect:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> All the Leaders who have signed this statement agree that the right to information, appropriately regulated by law, and to travel will be copperfastened in a further Referendum in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Legislative and/or Constitutional changes arising from the Supreme Court decision on Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution will be placed before the Dáil by the Government as soon as is practicable and, in any case, by the autumn.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with the Bills, individually, I wish at the outset to give a brief outline of the effect of each Bill. I shall be dealing at some length with the complexities of the issues involved later in my contribution.</P>
    <P>The first point I want to make about the amendment proposed in the Twelfth Amendment Bill is that it will leave undisturbed the existing affirmative acknowledgement in Article 40.3.3º of the right to life of the unborn, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.  The amendment will be an addition to the existing Article 40.3.3, not a substitution for it.  The effect of the amendment is to afford full protection to the lives of pregnant women.  Under the amendment, where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such that her life is endangered if the pregnancy continues, the pregnancy may be lawfully terminated, if that is necessary to save her life.  The amendment therefore accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in every respect except suicide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It negatives the decision in respect of suicide but in no other respect.</P>
      <P>The proposal in the Thirteenth Amendment Bill would ensure that Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution cannot in future be invoked to prevent a woman travelling abroad, whatever the purpose of her journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, the proposal in the Fourteenth Amendment Bill would ensure <Col N="1897" /> that Article 40.3.3º cannot in future be invoked, as it was in a number of recent cases, to prevent the dissemination, in accordance with conditions to be laid down by law, of information about services lawfully available in another state. The particular service which we are talking about here is, of course, abortion.</P>
    <P>The substantive issue, which is dealt with in the Twelfth Amendment Bill, is the one that clearly has attracted most controversy and debate.  Before dealing in some detail with this amendment I think it is only right to place on the record of this House the Government's appreciation of the willingness of other parties in the House to endeavour to achieve a consensus on how best to approach this matter.  Unfortunately, that consensus did not prove possible but I believe that the process of trying to achieve it at the very least threw some light on the many complexities involved.  To the extent that there are some who support, in effect, abortion on demand, clearly there never was a prospect of consensus with them.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed on this issue is the insertion into Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution of the following additional wording:</P>
    <P>It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be only too well aware, this wording has been strongly criticised by groups who stand at either end of the debate on this difficult, complex and controversial subject.  I hope to persuade the House and the people of our country that the more extreme views expressed on either side of the debate should be rejected and that the amendment now being proposed should be accepted as a moderate and balanced response to the problem presented.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Supreme Court's decision was to permit termination of <Col N="1898" /> pregnancy where there is real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by such termination and that a risk of self-destruction may constitute a real and substantial risk.  The amendment reflects this test in every respect except that it excludes a risk of self-destruction. The Government do not regard it as acceptable that such a risk should be available as grounds for termination of pregnancy.  There is considerable room for subjective judgement in assessing whether a risk of suicide exists and the availability of such a ground for termination would carry the danger of opening the way to widescale abortion.  It is quite clear that the experience in other countries has been that grounds for abortion related to health, physical or mental, lead to abortion on demand.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, the test laid down by the Supreme Court is being retained.  Under the amendment all treatments necessary to save the life of an expectant mother will be allowed.  Her entitlement to have her right to life vindicated will be safeguarded. The constitutional right to life of the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother conferred by Article 40.3.3º is not being diminished. Intervention affecting the life of the unborn is only justified where it is necessary to save the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>The importance which the Government attach to the need to protect the life of the mother is the reason we have not been able to accept the amendment put forward by the Pro-Life campaign. That amendment seeks to confine the possibility of termination of pregnancy to situations where it is the indirect or unsought side-effect of treatment necessary to save the mother's life.</P>
    <P>In proposing their formula the Government were conscious of the fact that, apart from terminations arising in cases such as cancer of the uterus, ectopic pregnancy and treatment of breast cancer, there are other life-threatening illnesses, either associated with pregnancy or exacerbated by pregnancy, in which the need to take action involving termination <Col N="1899" /> of the pregnancy to save the woman's life may have to be considered.</P>
    <P>This is where the Government differs from the pro-life groups.  These groups are prepared to say, and have said repeatedly, that there are no medical conditions, without any exception whatsoever, in which what they call a &ldquo;direct&rdquo; termination is necessary.  They speak as if there was total unanimity among all doctors and all medical specialists on this issue, but that clearly is not the case.</P>
    <P>Writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 October the Chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists stated that in a survey of their membership carried out last April a substantial minority felt that there were rare cases in which, because of the risk to the mother's life, direct termination of pregnancy was medically indicated.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 October, an eminent cardiologist was reported as saying the following:</P>
    <P>In the practice of cardiology over the past 30 years I have seen women whose lives would undoubtedly have been endangered had their pregnancies been allowed to go full term and I can state that unequivocally.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the radio on 12 October the President of the IMO stated that there were differing views among their members on this question.</P>
    <P>In the face of comments like these and others, how can anybody reasonably demand of the Government that no account should be taken of the possibility, however remote, that termination of pregnancy may be necessary to save life in the case of the other life-threatening conditions I have mentioned.  Neither the Government nor anybody else who supports the proposed amendment has said that these life-threatening conditions occur frequently or are common. They are rare conditions but they cannot be ignored, especially when we are framing a constitutional amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Pro-life groups make much of the distinction between &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; termination mainly on the basis that an indirect termination is an unintended effect of other treatment.  It seems to me that this distinction could not serve as the basis for a constitutional provision on this subject.  It is difficult to see how it can be maintained, for example, that in removing a cancerous womb there is no intention of terminating the life of the foetus when that result is clearly foreseen from the very outset and is inevitable.  As a matter of law foreseen consequences of an act are, of course, intended.</P>
      <P>If our law was that only so-called &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; terminations were permitted, how would that affect new treatment methods for ectopic pregnancy which apparently &ldquo;directly&rdquo; remove the foetus from the fallopian tube?  Surely it is not being suggested that this treatment should be made unlawful, but would that not be the effect of a provision which would permit only &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; terminations?</P>
      <P>Another difficulty in replying on the &ldquo;direct&rdquo;/&ldquo;indirect&rdquo; distinction is that these concepts do not always seem to mean the same thing to different people. I have heard it argued publicly by a Pro-Life spokesperson within the past couple of weeks that the new form of treatment for ectopic pregnancy is, in fact, indirect termination of the life of the foetus. Indeed it can even be argued that it is difficult to see how any operation, the sole purpose of which is to save the life of the mother, could be regarded as a direct killing of the foetus.  On that criterion any intervention permitted by the Twelfth Amendment Bill would be indirect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that a distinction between so-called &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; termination cannot be written into the law without threatening existing medical practice, particularly in the case of ectopic pregnancies.  The Government's proposal is clear and straightforward and will not prevent what is necessary from being done in our hospitals to save the lives of mothers as <Col N="1901" /> is done at present.  To introduce such a distinction into the amendment would be to introduce confusion and uncertainty for doctors, their patients and the courts and this is something which the Government cannot accept.  In the Government's view the only acceptable test is whether the action is necessary to save the life of the mother and the question of whether the action needed for that purpose constitutes direct or indirect termination is beside the point and, in any event, is not capable of an unequivocal answer in all situations.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing here is that a provision be inserted in our fundamental law &mdash; the Constitution &mdash; that is likely to remain unaltered for the foreseeable future.  In that situation we must do all we can to get the provision right and we would be failing in our duty to women and to their entitlement to protection where there is a risk to their life if we refused to take account of the fact that cases may arise, however infrequently, where the woman's life would be endangered by continuation of the pregnancy. If there were to be only one case in one million, or even ten or more million, we would have to take account of it. There is a duty on all of use to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no warrant whatsoever for any suggestion that the amendment will open the door to abortion.  It is most emphatically not an abortion amendment.  Far from making the law concerning abortion more permissive, as some people are wrongly suggesting, the amendment will have exactly the opposite effect: it will prohibit abortion in circumstances where it is now permitted without disturbing existing medical practice and without putting mothers' lives at risk.  It is a provision that arises from a woman's entitlement to protection where there is a risk to her life and it <Col N="1902" /> enshrines that protection.  I would submit that in all conscience we could do no less than we are doing.  The Government's proposal ought to satisfy the concerns of all of those who wish the law of the land to protect the life of the unborn in Ireland.  It would be a tragedy for the unborn if the amendment were to be defeated in the forthcoming referendum by a combination of those who do not wish the unborn to be protected by the law &mdash; i.e. who in greater or lesser degree favour permitting abortion in this country &mdash; and certain misguided persons on the Pro-Life side who seem to be blind to the merits of the amendment from their own point of view.</P>
      <P>I do not think, either, that there is any basis for suggesting that the test whereby a termination is permissible where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother is out of line with what our law was even before the X case.</P>
      <P>First, the 1861 Act which prohibits abortion does not contain a blanket prohibition. What it prohibits is &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; abortion.  The use of the word &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; has from the beginning given rise to the view that the act envisaged that there were circumstances in which the termination of a pregnancy was legally permissible and the general view always seems to have been that termination necessary to save the life of the mother was legally permissible.  If therefore a case had come for decision by the courts solely by reference to the 1861 Act, it seems highly probable that a termination of pregnancy in those circumstances would have been allowed.</P>
      <P>Secondly, our Constitution provides in Articles 40.3.1º and 2º an explicit guarantee to protect and vindicate the right to life of all persons, including, of course, expectant mothers.  It is reasonable to suggest that if a court had to choose between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the foetus, that explicit constitutional guarantee would impel the court to save the life of the mother.  Judge O'Flaherty in the X case intimated that the court would have come to the same decision, even if Article 40.3.3º did not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1903" /> Thirdly, even considering Article 40.3.3º, it seems to me that the provision, looked at critically, inevitably raises, as the Supreme Court recognised, the question of what happens when there is a conflict between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the foetus. That is a question which most people, in common with the Supreme Court, will agree should be answered in favour of the mother.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the suicide aspect, the substance of the Supreme Court decision is, in my view, fully in line with preexisting law and I imagine is widely acceptable.  That is why the proposed amendment reproduces the substance of the decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The inclusion in the amendment of the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; has been criticised by some particularly on the basis that it is offensive to women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that when I explain the reason for its inclusion it will not be seen in that light.</P>
      <P>The phrase reflects the Supreme Court decision in so far as it provides that the risk must be to the life of the mother in the sense that, unless the risk is avoided, she would die.  The phrase is taken from the Chief Justice's judgment but it is clear that the other judges also had in mind a risk to life rather than a risk to health. The reality which we cannot ignore is that in other jurisdictions risk of damage to health is the ground which has led to widescale abortion on demand.  It is in order to prevent that situation developing here that the phrase is included in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some doctors have expressed concern that the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; could have the effect of restricting a certain flexibility which under current medical practice doctors are permitted to exercise in the <Col N="1904" /> best interests of the patient.  It is suggested that in any medical condition there is a spectrum of gravity and it is impossible to identify a precise point at which the risk changes from a risk to health to a risk to life.  The concern of the doctors involved seems to be that the wording may result in their being forced to have a greater degree of certainty about the risk to the mother's life before providing treatment which may result in the loss of the foetus &mdash; whereas normal medical practice cannot operate on the basis of certainty but only on the basis of probability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that I can provide reassurance on this point.  The intention of the amendment is that a risk to health unrelated to a risk to life is not sufficient to warrant termination of the life of the unborn.  It is not the intention of the amendment to affect in any way the degree of probability of risk to life that is necessary to warrant treatment resulting in termination.  In the X case the Supreme Court laid down the test as being a real and substantial risk to the mother's life arising as a matter of probability. There is nothing in the proposed wording which would change that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to allay fears which have been expressed by some that the use of the word &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; in the amendment might result in pregnant women being denied necessary medical treatment to protect their health.  There is no basis for such fears.  Under the amendment women will continue to receive all necessary medical treatment to protect their health.  Current medical practice in this regard will not be affected.  Under current medical practice the question of termination of pregnancy only arises where there is a threat to the mother's life.  After all, the amendment does no more than adopt the test laid down in this regard by the Supreme Court in the X case and there has been no suggestion that medical practice regarding necessary treatment to protect <Col N="1905" /> women's health has been affected in any way since that decision.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; should be omitted from the proposed amendment really boils down to this &mdash; that it should be possible to terminate the life of an unborn child where there is no risk to the life of the mother.  Let there be no doubt about one thing.  The amendment as it stands will allow all necessary treatment to be provided for an expectant mother, even if it would result in the loss of the life of her unborn child, in all circumstances where her life is at risk.  There is no basis whatsoever for any suggestion that the amendment we are proposing here today will leave a woman without protection in any situation where her life is endangered.  The clear intent of the amendment and the clear meaning of the words it uses in that medical intervention will be allowed in all situations where it is necessary to save the mother's life because of a life-threatening physical, medical condition that she is suffering from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government saw any way that the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; could be omitted without giving rise to a real danger that this might eventually lead to abortion on demand, we would leave them out.  It can be argued that a reference to &ldquo;life&rdquo; on its own should be sufficient &mdash; on the basis that &ldquo;life&rdquo; means &ldquo;life&rdquo; and not &ldquo;health&rdquo; and that the reference to &ldquo;life&rdquo; in the existing Article 40.3.3º has been interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case as not including health.  However, the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; formed part of the test enunciated by the Chief Justice in that case.  If those words were to be omitted now from a constitutional provision which reproduces the essence of that test, significance might well be read into that omission.  In a future &ldquo;hard&rdquo; case health unrelated to a life-threatening condition might be found <Col N="1906" /> to be a ground for abortion, as happened in Britain in the Bourne case with the results we are all familiar with.</P>
      <P>Health unrelated to a threat to life has never been a ground for medical intervention where it is foreseen and therefore intended that the death of the unborn child would result.  Unforeseen death of the foetus in the course of a medical intervention to protect the mother's life or her health, where all due care is taken to preserve the life of the foetus, is, of course, an entirely different matter and is not prohibited by law anyway.  What the proposed Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution seeks to do is to maintain a just and proper balance between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the unborn child.</P>
      <P>A further criticism which has been made of the amendment is that it does not provide adequate protection for women in a situation where there would be a risk of the life of the mother being shortened rather than of her immediate death.  In particular it has been suggested that the proposed amendment would not allow a woman to have her pregnancy terminated if she suffered from a medical condition &mdash; for example, a severe heart condition &mdash; which did not pose an immediate threat to her life but which would result in her early death if her pregnancy continued to full term.  It has been suggested that the use of the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; implies that there must be an immediate risk to the mother's life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that this does not follow.  In the X case the Supreme Court held that termination of pregnancy is permissible where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother which can only be avoided by termination.  The formulation &ldquo;which can only be avoided&rdquo; seems to be at least as stringent as &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court also found that the risk to the mother's life need not be immediate.  In fact it expressly rejected a submission that termination would be permissible only if it were established that an inevitable or immediate risk to the life of the mother existed.  The proposed amendment does not disturb or change that finding in any <Col N="1907" /> way and does not require an immediate risk to life.</P>
    <P>Immediate necessity for termination of a pregnancy and immediate risk to the mother's life are, I suggest, two different things.  The words &ldquo;necessary to save the life&rdquo; mean that a pregnancy could be terminated if the doctors were able to form the view that, even after childbirth and recovery of the mother from it, other treatment for whatever she was suffering from would be ineffective to save her life.</P>
    <P>On the substantive issue one of the key questions which the Government had to address was whether the implications of the Supreme Court decision in the X case should be dealt with by way of legislation or an amendment to the Constitution.  I know that some Members of the House are of the view that to proceed by way of legislation, rather than an amendment to the Constitution, would be better. However, any legislation which would be introduced without an amendment of the Constitution would have to accept in full the findings of the Supreme Court in the X case, including the finding that a risk of suicide would be a ground for abortion. Suicide as a ground could not be removed by legislation alone.  Also, without an amendment the possibility could not be excluded that at some future date the grounds for abortion could be widened.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that concerns have been expressed that to deal with this matter by way of an amendment to the Constitution carries with it the danger of an emotive and divisive public debate.  The fact that a particular issue gives rise to strongly held and often opposing views can hardly be accepted as a reason for not allowing the people to have a final say on that issue.  There is a substantial body of opinion among the general public that the position now obtaining under Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, in so far as a risk of self-destruction can serve as a ground for termination, is at variance with what many people thought it would be when that provision was adopted by referendum in 1983.  The Government consider that it is only right that the people should be given a say as to <Col N="1908" /> whether they want that position modified now.</P>
    <P>Should it transpire that the people decide not to adopt the Twelfth Amendment, the Government have decided to introduce legislation instead to regulate the position obtaining as a result of the X decision.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, will be dealing with this aspect in the course of his contribution to this debate.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary suggestion has been made in some quarters that, by indicating at this stage their intentions about legislation in the event of the proposed amendment not being adopted, the Government are in some sense issuing a threat to people who may not be satisfied with the proposed amendment from a pro-life perspective to, as it were, &ldquo;vote for it or else.&rdquo;  This suggestion is, of course, nonsense.  The plain fact of the matter is that if the position obtaining after the X case is not addressed by way of an amendment to the Constitution, it can only be dealt with by legislation.  The Government are proposing an amendment of the Constitution and, after full and careful consideration of what is involved and of all the implications, are proposing the form of amendment which they are satisfied meets the needs to safeguard the lives of pregnant women while at the same time giving the maximum possible protection to the right to life of the unborn child consistent with that. If that amendment is defeated, which incidentally I do not believe will happen, it is the Government's firm and considered view that the only practicable alternative is to legislate on the basis of the X case.  That is simply a fact.  It is not meant to be a threat to anybody or to put pressure on them to vote in a particular way in the referendum.  The reality of the situation is that, if the Government are not prepared to indicate at this stage what form our legislative proposals would take in the event that the constitutional amendment did not pass, we would be open to legitimate criticism.  I fail to see how anybody can seriously suggest that we are to be faulted for ensuring that the people will be fully informed about the <Col N="1909" /> whole picture when they vote in the referenda on 3 December.</P>
    <P>The question has also been raised whether legislation should be introduced which would supplement the amendment, if passed.  It seems to me that the test proposed in the amendment is a straightforward one based on whether or not termination of pregnancy is necessary to save the life of the mother and should not give rise to difficulty in practice.  The Government are not at this stage persuaded of the need for such supplementary legislation.  We will, of course, listen carefully to any views expressed on this matter during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that Protocol No.17 to the Maastricht Treaty saves the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3º from the effect of EC law which, under the Constitution, takes precedence over any other conflicting provisions of the Constitution.  The Protocol was designed to ensure that abortion would not become legalised in the State by virtue of EC law.  The Protocol relates to Article 40.3.3º as it stood on 7 February 1992 when the Treaty was signed.  On the face of things Article 40.3.3º as interpreted by the Supreme Court should retain the protection of the Protocol when the Treaty comes into effect and this would mean that abortion could not in any event be legalised beyond the extent permitted by the Supreme Court.  The Solemn Declaration on the Protocol to the Treaty, adopted by the member states on 1 May 1992, provides that in the event of a constitutional amendment of Article 40.3.3º the Contracting Parties to the Treaty will, following the entry into force of the Treaty, be favourably disposed to amending the Protocol so as to extend its application to any such constitutional amendment.  If the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution is passed the question of invoking the procedure set out in the Solemn Declaration with a view to securing an amendment of the Protocol will be taken up.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Government have taken a balanced and considered approach to the very difficult problems <Col N="1910" /> associated with the substantive issue.  We recognise the genuineness and the depth of people's feelings and concerns about this whole subject&mdash;whether from a pro-life, pro-choice or other point of view. Our objective is to do what is right in the public interest.  We have been motivated by deep concern for the right to life of the unborn.  We are also fully committed to the protection of the right to life of the unborn.  We are not prepared to take any chances where the life of the mother is at stake and we want to ensure the maximum possible protection of the right to life of the unborn consistent with that.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Thirteenth Amendment Bill regarding travel.  The background to the proposal in this Bill must be seen in the context not only of the Supreme Court's decision in the X case but also in the context of EC law.</P>
    <P>In that case, three of the Supreme Court judges decided that the constitutional right to life of the unborn took precedence over the constitutional right to travel of the mother so that an injunction can be granted by virtue of Article 40.3.3º against women going abroad for an unlawful abortion (i.e. one in which there is not a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, as enunciated by the Supreme Court).</P>
    <P>With regard to the EC aspects, the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty provides that nothing in the Treaty or in the European Community Treaties shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.  Assuming that the Maastricht Treaty comes into force, the Protocol will then form part of the European Community Treaties and it will be for the European Court of Justice to decide what the Protocol means.</P>
    <P>The Irish Courts will be bound by that court's interpretation of the Protocol. The main purpose of the Protocol was to ensure that abortion would not become legalised in the State by virtue of EC law &mdash;freedom of travel to other EC states for an abortion was not envisaged as being affected.  However, the argument has been made that the Maastricht Protocol, if passed, would copperfasten the effect of the Supreme Court judgment in <Col N="1911" /> relation to travel and would nullify rights of free movement conferred by the EC and Maastricht Treaties.</P>
    <P>Whether this is correct depends, of course, on the proper interpretation of the phrase in the Protocol &ldquo;the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3º &rdquo;.  It can be contended that the issue of an injunction in Ireland against a woman within the jurisdiction to protect an unborn life within the jurisdiction is an application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3. On the other hand it can also be argued that the phrase must be intended to refer to effects in Ireland only and cannot restrict movement or actions outside Ireland.  That has been the contention of the EC Council's Legal Service.</P>
    <P>Freedom of movement of persons is one of the freedoms guaranteed by the EC Treaties.  It is part of the Community's legal order that people are free to move to any place in the Community, either to work or to establish themselves, or to provide or receive services.  This freedom, as is clear in particular from provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, is a fundamental principle of the Community and will be of growing value in the years to come.  Because of the fundamental importance of freedom of movement in the EC, it is likely that if in future the European Court had to deal with the issue, it would decide that the Protocol did not envisage Article 40.3.3º having extra-territorial effect and that injunctions against leaving the country for another EC member state could not be issued consistently with EC law.</P>
    <P>However, to avoid any uncertainty about the matter, the Solemn Declaration on which the Government got agreement among EC partners affirms in effect that the Protocol as it stands protects the right to travel between EC states and under generally recognised rules of interpretation of international treaties&mdash;I am referring in particular to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties&mdash;the Declaration would have to be taken into account in interpreting the Protocol.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposed constitutional <Col N="1912" /> amendment on travel is designed in any event to put exercise of the right to travel beyond doubt and to make it clear that it cannot be restricted by reason of Article 40.3.3º.  This is in line with the commitment in the statements of 9 June 1992 of party leaders, which I have already mentioned.  It will also ensure freedom to travel to all States, not just to other member states of the EC.  It is fair to say that there is wide support for the Government's proposal on this matter.</P>
    <P>I come now to the third Bill, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill on freedom to provide and receive information.  This issue did not, as I have said earlier, come before the Supreme Court in the X case.  However, the Supreme Court decided in cases in 1988 (the <i>Well Woman Centre</i> case) and 1989 (the <i>Grogan case</i>) that the dissemination of information on abortion is unlawful having regard to Article 40.3.3º.  Following the X case that prohibition extends only to information on abortion not covered by the decision (i.e. abortions in cases where there is not a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother).  In the <i>Well Woman Centre</i> case, which is at present before the European Court of Human Rights on allegations of breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights, the State has conceded that point.</P>
    <P>The information issue was raised before the EC Court of Justice in the <i>Grogan</i> case.  The effect of the decision of the Court of Justice is that, while lawful abortion in a state constitutes a service within the meaning of the EC Treaty, it is not contrary to Community law for a member state in which abortion is forbidden to prohibit the distribution of information about abortion services available in another member state where there is no economic link between the provider of the abortion service and the distributor of the information (in the particular case the distributor was a students' association).  The court did not specifically decide, but could be taken as implying, that if there was such a link the distribution of the information would be <Col N="1913" /> permissible under Community law.  That aspect, including the conditions which might be placed on the provision of information, has not come before the court in any case.</P>
    <P>Recently, on 7 August 1992, the High Court granted a permanent injunction in the Grogan case restraining the students from distributing information on abortion clinics abroad.  The judge in the case identified a profound distinction between the distribution of the documentation and information in which the students were engaged&mdash;distribution to the community at large and university students in particular&mdash;and communication of such information to a clearly defined and extremely restricted type of person indentified by the Supreme Court in the X case.</P>
    <P>As in the case of travel, the question of the freedom to give and obtain, in the State, information about abortion facilities in another EC state has been raised in the context of the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty.  The argument has been made that the Protocol would nullify rights to information conferred by EC law.  The Solemn Declaration on which the Government got agreement among EC Partners deals with the matter.  It affirms that the Protocol protects freedom to obtain or make available in Ireland information relating to services lawfully available in member states.  The Declaration also provides that the information may be subject to Irish legislation that is in conformity with Community law.  As I have already said, under generally recognised rules of interpretation of international treaties, the Declaration would have to be taken into account in interpreting the Protocol.</P>
    <P>On the basis of what we know from the Grogan case, as dealt with by the Court of Justice, there is no absolute right to information under EC law &mdash; the right indeed may be subject to appropriate conditions laid down in national laws. The fact is that member states have a reasonable margin of discretion to decide what should or should not be permissible in their national laws on abortion information and some EC states have controls <Col N="1914" /> on public advertising of abortion services.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the question of the right to information is before the European Court on Human Rights at present in a case involving the Well Woman Centre.  The court is due to issue its decision on 29 October but there are no grounds for believing that that will interfere in any way with the amendment on information.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment would enshrine in the Constitution the right to receive and impart information subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law.  This, again, is in line with the commitments given in the party leaders' statement.  The amendment would not permit directive counselling but would permit non-directive counselling.  Directive counselling, as I understand it, is systematic guidence and advice and involves abortion referral.  Non-directive counselling, on the other hand, consists of the provision of information and does not involve abortion referral.  Non-directive counselling would clearly be covered by the right to obtain or make available information which is provided for in the amendment.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with publication of the Constitutional Amendment Bill on information the Government have agreed the publication of the Minister for Health's proposals for legislative controls on the supply of information.  Those proposals can only be published in draft form at this stage because they are dependent on the amendment of the Constitution being carried in the referendum that is proposed. The Government's view is that the House and the people should be aware of what the Government's approach would be on supply of information.  My colleague the Minister for Health will be speaking further on this matter in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one final point.  The decision of the Government has been to put the issues to the people as separate amendments in separate referenda on the same day rather than in one amendment which would deal with the issues together.  It is the view of the Government <Col N="1915" /> that the advantage of separate referenda is a greater degree of choice in that the people will be enabled to exercise their choice separately in respect of each issue.  Voters will be able to vote for or against each issue and each amendment will be decided in its own right and on its own merit.  There appears to have been a general welcome for that approach among the public and I am sure that Deputies will agree that it is the most democratic way of dealing with these important issues.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bills to the House.</P>

      <P>It is only right at the start of this debate we recall the circumstances which have given rise to the constitutional referenda proposals now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very end of January 1992 a report was made to the Garda that a 14 year old girl had been the victim of sexual abuse and statutory rape and was pregnant. The girl's parents reached the conclusion that the pregnancy resulting from rape should be terminated.  On 27 January 1992 she told her parents and she and her parents learnt from the local doctor that she was pregnant.  It was accepted by the court that this tragic young girl, referred to as X, had confided in her mother that when she learnt she was pregnant she had wanted to kill herself by throwing herself downstairs.  On 31 January 1992 she again said much the same to a member of the Garda Síochána. During the return journey from England she told her mother that she had wanted to throw herself under a train <Col N="1916" /> when she was in London and that she would be rather dead than the way she was.  In the presence of another member of the Garda, when her father commented that the situation was worse than a death in the family she stated, &ldquo;Not if it was me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following her return from England she was taken by her parents to an experienced clinical psychologist.  He found that she was emotionally withdrawn, in a state of shock and had lost touch with her feelings.  He took that as indicating that she was coping with the appalling crisis she faced by denial of her emotions.  He stated that she did not seem depressed but that she coldly expressed a desire to end matters by taking her own life.  The psychologist was of the opinion that she was capable of committing suicide, not just because of depression but because she could calculatingly reach the conclusion that death was the best solution.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister did not refer in detail to the facts of this case in his speech.  In the High Court Judge Costello accepted that there was a risk that this tragic young teenager might take her own life.  He held, however, that it was much less and in a different order of magnitude than the certainty that the life of the unborn would be terminated if the injunction were not granted.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the case give rise to substantial public controversy.  A Supreme Court appeal was brought and was successful.  In dealing with the circumstances in which a pregnancy can be terminated by way of abortion, a majority of the Supreme Court concluded that a pregnancy may be terminated if it was established as a matter of probability that its continuance involved a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  The court concluded that there was no doubt that such a risk existed from the uncontested evidence heard by the trial judge in the High Court.  The court did not differentiate between a physical condition which poses such risk and a mental condition.  The Chief Justice stated:</P>
    <P>In my view it is common sense that <Col N="1917" /> a threat to self-destruction such as is outlined in the evidence in his case, which the psychologist clearly believes to be a very real threat, cannot be monitored in that sense and that it is almost impossible to prevent self-destruction in a young girl in the situation in which this defendant is, if she were to decide to carry out her threat of suicide.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Egan stated:</P>
    <P>The risk must be to her life but it is irrelevant, in my view, that it should be a risk of self-destruction rather than a risk to life for any other reason.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice O'Flaherty agreed with this conclusion, as did the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy.  The latter stated:</P>
    <P>I am wholly satisfied that a real and substantial risk that the girl might take her own life was established; it follows that she should not be prevented from having a medical termination of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The only judge who dissented from this conclusion was Mr. Justice Hederman. This decision of the Supreme Court resolved a controversy that had raged on and off within the State since 1982 as to the exact meaning of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, Article 40.3.3º. It confirmed that this Article, rather than totally prohibiting abortion, as its original proponents contended, contemplated abortion lawfully taking place within this State.</P>
    <P>The result of the X case was not merely to allow this young girl to again travel to England to have her pregnancy terminated but also to entitle her to have an abortion in this State if she sought one in the tragic circumstances in which she found herself.  While it was not necessary for the court to decide the issue of the girl's right to travel, having regard to her entitlement to terminate her pregnancy within the State, the judges of the court nevertheless addressed that issue due to its essential public importance.  By a majority they concluded that a woman's right to travel outside the State could be <Col N="1918" /> impeded by way of court injunctions in circumstances where she intended to have a pregnancy terminated and where there was no real and substantial risk to her life.</P>
    <P>It is, I believe, no exaggeration to state that the result of the Supreme Court case with regard to the circumstances of this tragic 14 year old girl and her family was greeted with a universal sigh of national relief.  It was, I believe, a general view that a pregnant young teenager who is the victim of rape and her family should not be put through such a legal trauma. There was a belief that the young girl and her family should have been left to make decisions that they believed right in the interests of the girl's welfare and that the State should not have interfered.</P>
    <P>For many of those &mdash; and I include myself in this &mdash; who opposed the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution in the referendum campaign in 1983 the case in a very stark way highlighted the possible different interpretations that could be put on the words contained in it and the manner in which its constitutional provision could impact on the lives of ordinary people trapped in personal tragedy. It was always my view that this provision was a constitutional time bomb waiting to go off.  What is surprising is that it took almost 10 years to explode.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the specific constitutional proposals before the House there are some general comments I want to make with regard to the difficult issues with which we are confronted.  Neither the Fine Gael Party nor the overwhelming majority of people on this island want to see general abortion available in Ireland&mdash;what some people refer to as &ldquo;abortion on demand&rdquo;.  In saying that, I reiterate what was said in the House on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to both myself and many of my colleagues during the difficult and emotional debate that took place on the Eighth Amendment Bill in 1983.  It was then and is again important that this be put on the record because in 1983 anyone either inside or outside the House who for good and considered reasons was opposed to the holding of that referendum and who disagreed <Col N="1919" /> with the wording which was eventually inserted in the Constitution found themselves labelled abortionist and anti-life. In 1983 for totally cynical political reasons the Fianna Fáil Party sought to so label and besmirch Members of this House and others for their own cynical electoral gain.  From the speech given by the Minister for Justice today, it is apparent that Fianna Fáil intend to again travel along that road during the course of the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>There was a hope following the coming to office of the present Taoiseach that no similar games would be played by Fianna Fáil with such sensitive and difficult issues.  There was a glimmer of hope that we were entering a new political era and that difficult social issues would be honestly and openly addressed.  The Government's behaviour during the past two weeks, however, clearly illustrates that this is not so.  If there is a single lesson that should have been learned by politicians inside this House and, indeed, by lobby groups outside it, it is that this whole area is far too complex to simply be dealt with by the insertion of an extra sentence or two into our Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>To highlight this, it is worth briefly recalling the claims made by the proponents of the 1983 amendment, one of the most vociferous of which in this House was the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, together with other members of the current Government, including the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Warnings then sounded as to the ambiguity contained in the wording of the Eighth Amendment and their diversity of possible interpretations were ignored. The fact that these warnings were sounded by the then Fine Gael Taoiseach, Dr. G. FitzGerald, the then Attorney General, Mr. Peter Sutherland, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> and by many other <Col N="1920" /> members of the Fine Gael Party both in Government and on the backbenches simply resulted in allegations that such people were in some way soft on abortion.</P>
    <P>For the Fianna Fáil Deputies I have referred to and the lobby groups who operated outside this House, such as PLAC and SPUC, nothing was ambiguous. In 1983 everything was clear in absolutist terms.  Specualtion that the wording might not say what its advocates propounded was labelled dishonest. Those who queried its wording and the dangers of its application were the objects of hate-mail.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling what that advocates of the Eighth Amendment said they intended and contended with certainty would be achieved.  First, and foremost, they claimed it would outlaw abortion in all circumstances.  In this they were totally wrong and, now, of course, it is the Supreme Court and not themselves who are to blame.  They stated it would not affect the right of pregnant women to travel abroad; in this they were wrong also.  They contended that such a constitutional provision would provide a sort of atmosphere that would result in a reduction in the numbers of Irish women going abroad to terminate pregnancies; in this they were also wrong.  In 1983, approximately 3,000 Irish women, according to official figures, had abortions in England; in 1991 over 4,000 Irish women had abortions in England.</P>
    <P>The primary result of the 1983 amendment was to ensure that more people in Ireland were informed about the availability of abortion outside Ireland than would previously have considered abortion as an option.  It also has now provided for an implicit constitutional right to abortion, which right is now to be made explicit, in the terms of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>Assertions made by Members of this House in 1983 who are now in Government with regard to the effect of the 1983 amendment are of relevance in the context of the debate we are to have in particular on the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  They are relevant <Col N="1921" /> because we have seen in recent days that the proponents of the wording contained in the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill are unwilling to listen to those who are expressing concern as to its contents and worries about its impact.</P>
    <P>At the weekend, the Minister for Justice, was praised for his outstanding rhetoric at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting on Wednesday last which reportedly satisfied his political colleagues that the course the Government are charting is correct and that the constitutional amendments proposed by them are both legally and politically sound.</P>
    <P>I have, in recent weeks, had an eerie feeling that Members of this House and many of the lobby groups outside this House, are locked in a 1983 time warp. The reports I have heard of the Fianna Fáil meeting of Wednesday last have confirmed to me that we are truly back to the future.  From the Minister's speech this evening it is clear that the Fianna Fáil party, at least, have learned no lessons. I would caution those members of Fianna Fáil who are relying on the Minister's presentation of Wednesday last, and his presentation today, to be wary of convincing ministerial rhetoric and assertions.</P>
    <P>To his Fianna Fáil colleagues and those who will vote on this issue on 3 December next, and those who will vote in this House, I say judge the reliability of what the Minister is now saying against the accuracy of what he said in 1983.  If they do, they will see substantial reason for concern.  On 23 February 1983, the present Minister, Deputy Flynn stated, according to the Dáil Official Report, Volume 340, Column 979:</P>
    <P>I believe the amendment of the Constitution is not just desirable but essential, because the Constitution does not contain any specific protection for the unborn child... it [the amendment] will reinforce the existing law as we know it and it will guarantee that any future decision regarding abortion or the legalising of abortion, or any <Col N="1922" /> related matter, will have to be done by further referendum...</P>
    <P>Further on the same debate, exclaiming &ldquo;what a magnificent document the Constitution is&rdquo; the Deputy continued:</P>
    <P>The insertion of this amendment in the Constitution will mean simply that abortion cannot and will not be made legal either through legislation or judicial decision.</P>
    <P>Never a man to drop a hyperbole when he spies one on the distant horizon, returning to the same theme on the 2 March 1983, the present Minister stated at Column 1584, Volume 340 of the Dáil Official Report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It [the amendment] will act as a magnificent deterrent... to passing down a decision that they [the Supreme Court] will know, by referendum result, does not reflect the minds and the wishes of the majority of our people.  It will not be possible then to read abortion into the Constitution...</P>
    <P>Never has someone been proved so starkly wrong.</P>
    <P>As for those who expressed concerns about the exact meaning of Article 40.3.3º and its possible application the present Minister dismissively stated:</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, confusion is one of the main strategies, the main aim of the abortion lobby... they are seeking to impress and impose their aspirations and attitudes on the majority who do not share their permissive latitude in the matter of abortion and any shilly-shallying now or any devise to thwart or confuse or worse to abandon the enabling legislation, as far as I am concerned would be regarded as a victory for the abortionists.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the then members of the Fianna Fáil party in 1983 greatly admired the rhetoric of Deputy Flynn in this House as it was admired in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party rooms last week.  Presumably, they equally appreciated the politics of the matter and the ease with which the label &ldquo;abortionists&rdquo;<Col N="1923" /> could be attached to those who then disagreed with Fianna Fáil.  No doubt there are some within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party rooms who see the current referendum as yet another opportunity to so label those who disagreed with them.  It is remarkable that in the light of the present Minister's track record on this issue, that assertions made by him as to the correctness of the Government's approach can be taken so seriously and that reservations expressed by others can be so easily dismissed.</P>
    <P>Following the X case there was substantial public discussion about the issues of travel and information, but little if any detailed discussion with regard to the actual application of the main decision of the Supreme Court; that is, the decision that under the Constitution abortions can take place here where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. Government comment was confined to a statement that a Cabinet sub-committee was examining the issue and that it would come forward with proposals for legislation and/or a further constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>In the light of the strictures by the Supreme Court on the Oireachtas for its failure to enact legislation, following the 1983 referendum, it was widely expected that at the very least detailed legislative proposals would be forthcoming and that there would be a considered and comprehensive public debate.  There was a diversity of views about the need for a further constitutional amendment, but if one was proposed it was expected that recognition would have been given to the fact that something more than a simple constitutional prescription was required. Unlike 1983, no Opposition Party was waiting in the long grass to ambush the Government for reasons of political expediency.  Unlike Fianna Fáil in 1983, the Fine Gael party did not and have not aligned themselves with any of the lobby groups who address these issues from a narrow and blinkered perspective.</P>
    <P>It was a cause of astonishment to Fine Gael that the sole Government proposal with regard to this aspect of the problem <Col N="1924" /> is that there now be included in the Constitution an additional Article which is contained in the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which states:</P>
    <P>It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction.</P>
    <P>Astonishingly, the Government propose to publish no legislation to provide for the detailed implementation of Article 40.3.3º and this additional provision, despite advice from the Attorney General that it is required.  In this, they are not only ignoring what was said by members of the Supreme Court but also ignoring the advice of their own Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The new Article proposed if incorporated into our Constitution, will have the following effect: (1) It will make express provision in the Constitution for abortion and the termination of pregnancies; (2) it will allow an abortion to take place where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of a young girl or woman, but not where there is a real and substantial risk to her health; (3) the risk to life will have to derive from an illness or disorder and not from any other source and (4) if a pregnancy poses a risk that the mother may commit suicide an abortion will be prohibited in this State.</P>
    <P>The document published by the Government as the Attorney General's advice on the day when this proposed wording was made public asserts that:</P>
    <P>The amendment accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in every respect except suicide.  It therefore sets out to negative the decision in respect of suicide but in no other respect.  The effect is that where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such as that her life is endangered, the pregnancy may <Col N="1925" /> lawfully be terminated if that is necessary to save her life.</P>
    <P>Similar assertions were made today by the Minister for Justice.  I intend to deal with the issue of suicide at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I first wish to deal with the statement that the amendment &ldquo;accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in every respect except suicide&rdquo;.  The four members of the Supreme Court also were of the view that a pregnancy which posed a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother could be terminated, each expressed this view in a somewhat different way.  The only majority judgement of a member of the court to contain an expressed distinction between life and health is the judgement of the Chief Justice which stated:</P>
    <P>If it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother, which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy, that such termination is permissible having regard to the true interpretation of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice O'Flaherty stated:</P>
    <P>The law in this State is that surgical intervention which has the effect of terminating pregnancy bona fide undertaken to save the life of the mother, where she is in danger of death, is permissible under the Constitution and the law.  The danger has to represent a substantial risk to her life, although this does not necessarily have to be an imminent danger of instant death.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Egan stated:</P>
    <P>A pregnancy may be terminated if its continuance as a matter of probability involves a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>The late Mr. Justice McCarthy stated:</P>
    <P>When there is a real and substantial risk attached to her survival, that is, the mother's, not merely at the time of application but in contemplation at <Col N="1926" /> least throughout the pregnancy, then it may not be practicable to vindicate the right to life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>For many women the constitutional line and distinction expressly drawn between life and health is grossly offensive. However, it is not only offensive but also dangerous and ill-advised.  It is a grave error to believe that this distinction can be easily drawn.  In discussions which the members of the Fine Gael Party have had with the medical profession it has been consistently stated to us that the timing of certain treatments could be affected by such distinction and that as a result women's lives could be placed at risk. This could particularly apply, for example, with regard to the treatment available to women who suffer from breast cancer or cancer of the cervix. Similar difficulties could arise with regard to the treatment of cardiac disease. Decisions about the treatments which should be given and the timing of such treatments for such illnesses should be left to the medical profession in consultation with their patients, that is, in consultation with the women who are affected by such illnesses.  Neither women nor doctors should feel at risk of treatments being withheld for fear of court action being taken by some individual or group.</P>
    <P>We have already seen in the days since the publication of this wording a substantial conflict between Ministers as to its meaning and intent.  Apparently the Minister for Justice sought to put this confusion to rest at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting last Wednesday, in further comment since then and again today in the House. However, I have already learned from the experience of 1983 that what is relevant here is not what politicians believe the wording to mean but what the wording expressly states and the manner in which the courts interpret it.  This distinction has rung alarm bells throughout the medical profession and is of substantial concern to many women throughout the State.  It is in the context of this distinction that the Fine Gael Party are <Col N="1927" /> concerned that the Government proposal is substantially flawed.</P>
    <P>It is not correct for the Attorney General to argue that this formulation is one accepted by the court; nor is it correct for the Minister to so argue.  It is a formulation solely contained in the judgement of the Chief Justice and in so far as that judgement differs between life and health it is not a distinction that the court had to address as a real issue in the case which came before it.  It was uncontroverted in the X case that the girl's threat of suicide posed a risk to her life and not to her health.  It is extraordinary that the Government should on the strength of what is a single judicial <i>obiter dicta</i> try to incorporate such a rigid distinction in our Constitution without detailed consideration of its implications.  It is even more extraordinary that the Minister in his speech today and in comments made by him during the past few days should imply that he could read the minds of the judges in the Supreme Court who made no such express distinction in the judgments they delivered.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiarly male approach to an issue of huge complexity.  Of course, there are only 13 women Members of this House but the docile acceptance of this proposal by the Fianna Fáil women Deputies is extraordinary.  I suspect that if the Government introduced legislation into this House which sought to include a provision in our Constitution which expressly allowed medical treatment in circumstances where a man's life was at risk but not his health it would be confronted by a parliamentary riot.</P>

      <P>I emphasise this is a distinction never properly teased out in the High Court hearing or in the Supreme Court judgments.  Neither has it been properly teased out by the Government. It is a distinction which should not be contained in this constitutional provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to recent comments by Ministers, I cannot help but speculate as to whether this distinction is there for political <Col N="1928" /> as opposed to sound legal and health reasons.  I suspect its inclusion is something of a political trojan horse and my suspicions have been heightened by the Minister's comments this afternoon. It is there so that it can be suggested by way of an action replay of the type of discredited approach we saw from Fianna Fáil in 1983 that those Opposition parties who wish to have it removed are in some way &ldquo;soft&rdquo; on abortion.  Statements by Ministers that the exclusion of this phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health of the mother&rdquo; could allow for easy abortion or abortion on demand should be taken with a grain of salt.  The observations of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty in the X case in this context are worth noting, where he stated that under the existing constitutional provision, unamended: &ldquo;Abortion on demand, is not something that can be legalised in this jurisdiction&rdquo;.  There should be no provision in our Constitution which raises any doubt as to the right of a woman to obtain treatment where circumstances arise that there is a probable risk to her life.  There is currently confusion and differences among members of the medical profession as to how they will apply this provision if it becomes part of our constitutional law. As is frequently said: &ldquo;when doctors differ, patients die&rdquo;.  In this instance, it can be said: &ldquo;when doctors differ, women will die&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the issue of suicide.  Part of the rationale for the government's wording is to exclude suicide or a threat of suicide as allowing for the termination of a pregnancy.  There is real and substantial concern that if a threat of suicide continued to be a general basis for the termination of pregnancy we would have in this country general abortion or abortion on demand.  This is based on the supposition that it is impossible to properly administer a law or a constitutional provision which allows for terminations in such circumstances and is based on the assumption that it would not merely be open to abuse but would <Col N="1929" /> be grossly abused.  The Fine Gael Party would have substantial concerns if the law as it applies with regard to suicide was to remain unchanged following the decision in the X case.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the issue of suicide, however, the Government have simply made a policy decision that no threat or risk of suicide should ever allow for the termination of a pregnancy and have assumed that if any exceptions to this were to become part of our law, no legislation could be enacted to ensure protection against abuse.  However, in a bizarre twist to this approach we are told we are to see legislation that the Government might introduce if the referendum on this Article is unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>There are countries where mental ill health and threats of suicide can result in pregnancies being terminated which have legislation which, in practice, works to prevent abuse and widescale abortion. There are other countries which have such legislation and where there is, in effect, abortion on demand, something I believe no one in this House wants to see.  Some of this legislation and its application in practice is reviewed in a recent paper published by Professor Anthony Clare and Dr. J. Tyrrell.  Such legislation can be drafted competently and can work or can be drafted incompetently and be unworkable.  The bona fides of the Government in their approach to this area will be clearly seen when their promised legislation is published.  However, it is extraordinary that the Government are able to draft legislation to detail how the law will apply if their referendum wording is unsuccessful but are unable and unwilling to prepare legislation on how it will apply if the referendum is successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are legitimate fears that threats of suicide as a ground for abortion could give rise to widespread abortion of a nature that would be anathema to the overwhelming majority of people in this country.  Fine Gael share these fears. However, the Government have an obligation not to lose sight of the very real problem illustrated by the X case.  In that case evidence was given that the tragic <Col N="1930" /> young victim of rape was suicidal and no contrary evidence was called on behalf of the State.  Presumably the State called no such evidence because the Attorney General accepted the truth of what the psychologist told the court.  If the Attorney General did not, it is extraordinary that the psychologist's evidence was not seriously challenged.</P>
    <P>At this stage in the debate we are entitled to ask the Government what consultations, if any, they engaged in with professional psychiatrists and psychologists who have experience in dealing with young girls and women who are the victims of sexual abuse, sexual assault and rape and who as a result have become pregnant.  As the Government are sponsoring this legislation, it is their duty and responsibility to further explain their approach to such tragic cases.</P>
    <P>No mention has been made by the Government of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Under Article 2 of that convention it is stated &ldquo;Everyone's right to life should be protected by law&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to tell the House whether the Government consider the Article they now propose be included in the Constitution protects a woman's right to life under this convention.  Has this issue been examined in any detail by the Government?  No mention of this convention was made by the Minister in his speech.  I suspect it is not an issue that has been addressed in any great detail by the Government in their considerations in bringing forward this proposal.</P>
    <P>The difficulties associated with the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill should not have to be solely addressed in a guillotined debate in the sole context of a constitutional proposal, the contents of which have only been in the public domain for 14 days.  It is the view of the Fine Gael Party that prior to a referendum being held on the substantive issue, detailed legislation addressing the difficulties involved should have been brought before this House for discussion by the Government.  There is no reason such legislation could not have been brought before this House.  Why is it that the Government have taken the view <Col N="1931" /> there is a need for such approach prior to a referendum in relation to divorce but no need for such an approach prior to this referendum?  If the Minister for Health is able to produce a draft of proposed legislation with regard to the issue of information, the Government should have been able to produce a draft of legislation addressing issues they now, apparently, intend to ignore in regard to this substantive problem.  There are, of course, other areas of genuine concern which are being ignored.</P>
    <P>An area of genuine concern to the medical profession and to women totally ignored by Government relates to a woman pregnant with a foetus that is anencephalic &mdash; without a brain.  There are about 40 such pregnancies annually and they are easily detectable during the early weeks of pregnancy.  A foetus so born cannot and does not survive.  There is a universal view in the medical profession that it should be possible within the law to terminate such pregnancies, that it is an unacceptable cruelty to require a pregnant woman to carry such a pregnancy to full term.  This is yet another area of difficulty that is being ignored in the context of the Government's proposal and has, I assume, never been considered by them.  Because of the difficulties involved in this area it cannot be properly addressed in two or three sentences in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>In regard to the right to travel and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, it appears that all sides in this debate agree that the right of a woman to travel abroad should not be impeded by constitutional constraints deriving from the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the X case a majority of the court expressed the view that where there was no real and substantial risk to the life of the mother and if she intended to go abroad to terminate her pregnancy, the courts could grant an injunction to prevent such termination.  The effect of the Government's proposal is understood to mean that no injunctions can be obtained in the future to prevent a pregnant <Col N="1932" /> woman travelling abroad whether or not she intends to obtain an abortion.</P>
    <P>The vision that the X case threw up, of pregnant women being effectively imprisoned in Ireland during the course of their pregnancy even alarmed extremist groups such as that fronted by Mr. William Binchy.  The alarm, I suspect, was more due to it being seen as a public relations own goal rather than out of any concern for women's rights to freedom of travel.  Of course, it is the freedom of women to travel which until the X case allowed us to evade addressing many of the difficult and substantial issues concerning abortion and allowed certain groups to maintain the facade that this country is an abortion-free zone.  The irrelevance of the Eighth Amendment in preventing abortion can be seen from the statistical figures referred to earlier which show that while in 1983, 3,000 Irish women per year approximately had abortions in England, by 1991 the figure was in excess of 4,000 &mdash; an increase of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The proposed Thirteenth Amendment, of course, also allows for a young girl or woman who is truly suicidal and who is regarded as such by her Irish psychiatrist or psychologist and who is denied an abortion in Ireland to go to England to obtain an abortion.</P>
    <P>The Health (Family Planning) Act of 1979 was stated at the time to be an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992 together with the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, is in effect, an English solution to an Irish problem.  For many it will highlight the hypocritical and politically schizophrenic approach we take to difficult social issues.</P>
    <P>In many Supreme Court judgments, including the judgement delivered in the X case, members of that court have emphasised that the Preamble to the Constitution records that the Constitution seeks to promote the common good &ldquo;with due observance of prudence, justice and charity&rdquo;.  The practical interaction between the Twelfth and Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment Bills <Col N="1933" /> now for the first time elevates hypocrisy to the level of a constitutional principle worthy of promotion together with the principles of prudence, justice and charity.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are welcome. However, it is unsatisfactory that the legislation that the Bill envisages has not yet been published by the Government. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Health is to tell the House the draft proposals.  If he has draft proposals, they should have been published well in advance of this debate so that reasonable consideration could be given to their implications by Members of this House.</P>
    <P>In regard to information and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, prior to the judgement in the X case, the principal impact of the Eighth Amendment was a series of court cases brought by SPUC against student groups and other agencies who were providing non-directive counselling to pregnant women which included information about pregnancy termination.  This whole area &mdash; as did the travel area &mdash; became further complicated as a result of the Irish Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty and the subsequent solemn declaration entered into in respect of that Treaty.</P>
    <P>In the court cases that ensued it was held that information could not be given to Irish women with regard to the obtaining of abortions outside Ireland and the Bill is intended to allow the making available of such information.</P>
    <P>There are many people of the view that the restraint on information has had a negative effect, that if Irish women seeking abortion abroad first felt free to obtain counselling at home, some at least might, after all the options had been explained to them, decide not to proceed to obtain an abortion.</P>
    <P>It is also extraordinary that the Government are intent on pushing the referendum Bill through all Stages in this House prior to the judgement of the European Court in the Open Door Counselling Limited and the Dublin Well Woman Centre Limited cases, which is scheduled to be delivered on 29 October next.  It is totally illogical to finalise this <Col N="1934" /> referendum Bill while the contents of this judgement remain unknown.</P>
    <P>For far too long we have dealt with this whole area from a narrow and negative perspective.  For far too long in debates such as this both inside and outside this House, men and talked about women in an offensive and unacceptable way, what Frances FitzGerald, the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women has graphically referred to as &ldquo;a disembodied debate about women's bodies&rdquo;.  For far too long we have played constitutional and political games with women's lives and the lives of the unborn.  Far too often in debates such as this, we lose sight of the fact that women do not conceive alone, that for every difficult and unwanted pregnancy a man shares the responsibility.  It has never been acknowledged in this House that without men there would be no abortions.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of people on this island are opposed to abortion but there is also now, I believe, a recognition that simplistic constitutional solutions or formulae do not and cannot provide the answer.  There is a need to take positive action, in so far as that is possible, to eliminate those circumstances that result in abortion in the first place.  The judges of the Supreme Court in the X case recognised this.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice O'Flaherty referring to the responsibility of the executive branch of Government, spoke of the positive thrust of Article 40.3.3º saying: &ldquo;The State should provide every practical assistance to pregnant women who find themselves unwillingly in that situation to help them make a decision which is in accordance with the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The late Mr. Justice McCarthy referring to the Eighth Amendment, stated:</P>
    <P>Since the Amendment contemplates lawful abortion, how may the State still, as far as practicable, vindicate the right to life of the unborn?  Legislation may be both negative and positive: negative in prohibiting absolutely or at a given time, or without meeting stringent tests; positive by requiring positive action.  The State may fulfil its <Col N="1935" /> role by providing necessary agencies to help, to counsel, to encourage, to comfort, to plan for the pregnant woman, the pregnant girl or her family. It is not for the courts to programme society; that is partly, at least, the role of the Legislature.  The courts are not equipped to regulate these procedures.</P>
    <P>The State has, of course, never enacted legislation to provide a comprehensive positive action programme such as the Article envisages.  That has largely been left to voluntary agencies, some of which over the years have been persecuted and vilified by extreme groups.  Tragically, the Government are ignoring this aspect of the Supreme Court judgement and by refusing to provide the comprehensive legislation required, are abdicating their constitutional duty to take positive action.  If the Government were truly pro-life and if they truly wished to reduce the numbers of Irish women who are currently having abortions, there would be a positive action programme being presented to this House.  Positive action is required; if not the numbers of Irish women having abortions will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>We need determined action to reduce the level of sexual crime, better family planning services with health boards accepting their full responsibilities, comprehensive sex education and education for life in our schools and the strengthening of services offering care, support, counselling and information into all aspects of pregnancy.  Such action would inevitably reduce the current demand for abortion very considerably.  No such action, sadly, is envisaged by this Government.</P>
    <P>The Government intend to push the three referenda Bills through this House with obscene haste.  It is the view of the Fine Gael Party that a more considered and detailed approach is required.  It is a mystery to everyone in the country outside the ranks of Fianna Fáil why the Taoiseach has irrevocably fixed 3 December next as the date by which the referenda must be held.</P>
    <P>The Government should postpone the <Col N="1936" /> passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas and the holding of the proposed referenda until all of the legislation necessary is published and until Members of this House have an opportunity to consider it in detailed debate.  The Government, at least the Fianna Fáil wing of Government, should stop playing political games with a difficult and serious issue that deserves better and more detailed consideration.  The people of this country deserve better than they now have on offer.</P>
    <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>To delete &ldquo;now&rdquo; and add at the end of the motion the words &ldquo;on 15 January, 1993 or on such earlier date as may be determined by the Dáil, after the Dáil had first discussed, up to and including Committee Stage, legislation designed to elaborate on the practical implementation of the provisions of this Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will take seriously this motion, that they will slow down in bringing this legislation to a completion and allow for more reasoned, detailed and considered discussion.</P>
    <P>I hope, too, that in the context of that discussion the dismissive attitude adopted in 1983 by members of Fianna Fáil to other parties and Members of this House who expressed concern at the constitutional proposal that we eventually included in our Constitution, will be given more consideration than was apparent from the approach taken by the Minister for Justice to this issue in the House this evening.  We shall be moving also, at the appropriate time, similar amendments to the other two Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>At the outset I would refer the House to the Amendment on behalf of the Labour Party which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, because of the dangers it poses to the life and other fundamental rights of Irish women, and because this House regards the subject matter of the Bill <Col N="1937" /> as being appropriate to regulation by way of legislation rather than Constitutional change.</P>
    <P>As I speak in this debate I want to make it abundantly clear, despite what has been said about me on many occasions, both in my constituency and elsewhere since 1983, that I speak as a pro-life leader of the oldest pro-life party in this State.  It is from that perspective, and that perspective alone, that I and the Labour Party reject the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution Bill &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo; amendment &mdash; in its entirely as it is presented to us by the Minister for Justice.  We regard this Bill as a brutal, divisive, and ultimately counter-productive attack on the most basic rights of Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>It is not acceptable to us, and it never will be, that our Constitution should set out to treat half of our citizens differently, just because those citizens happen to be women.</P>
      <P>From the day it was founded eighty years ago, the Labour Party has stood for life.  We have stood for the right to life, to shelter, to health and to welfare &mdash; and we have stood for them as fundamental rights.  Whether they were written into the Irish Constitution or not, it has been a fundamental tenet of my party that every Irish citizen has an equal right to all of these things.  And we have campaigned for them abroad, just as we have at home. Our record, and our consistency, in all of these issues cannot be challenged by anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have stood for the principle of a republic throughout all those years too. A republic for us involves a society built on tolerance, on freedom of expression and freedom to follow different beliefs. This Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, as it is drafted, is a brutal assault on the republic.  None of that makes us particularly special, or marks us out as different.  Most Irish people believe in the rights I have mentioned. Most Irish people believe in republican principles &mdash; real republican principles, <Col N="1938" /> not the perversions of republicanism practised by terrorists.  Most Irish political parties, too, support republican principles.  Indeed, one party leader in this House once made a famous declaration of his determination to stand by the republic.  We will all watch with interest to see whether or not he stands by, or stands idly by instead, when this attack on republican principles is voted upon this week.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being foisted on the people of Ireland by a Government that either has not thought it out, or is unable to understand, or is unwilling to admit, what the Bill actually means.  I have to say at this stage that it is typical of what we have come to expect from the present Taoiseach, who appears to believe in the idea that Government can operate with its eyes tightly shut, stumbling from crisis to crisis, without ever any clear philosophy or considered policy.  It seems clear from all of the Taoiseach's utterances on this subject that he regards this issue as nothing more than a political sore tooth, and the quicker it is dealt with the better.  It does not matter if the management of the problem actually makes it worse in the long-term &mdash; sure that will be someone else's problem.  The problem created by this Bill will be much more than a problem for politicians.  It will be a problem for the rights of women.  That is a fact that appears to have been completely ignored and passed over by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which will incorporate into our Constitution, alone among the written Constitutions of the western world, the principle of legal abortion, but it is so badly drafted that in practice, the wording of the Bill will potentially put many more women at risk than are at risk at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The most criticised aspect of the drafting of this Bill has been the use of the distinction between the life and the health of the mother.  Ministers have responded to all the criticisms of the drafting by saying &ldquo;that is not our distinction, they are the words of the Chief Justice in the X case&rdquo;.  That is one of the many myths that the Government are trying to <Col N="1939" /> perpetrate about this issue, and it is as well that it be disposed of at the outset.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice in the X case was dealing with a very particular set of circumstances, involving as we know the sort of tragedy that can devastate any Irish family, no matter how close or loving.  He was in essence adjudicating between two &ldquo;tests&rdquo; that had been put forward in the particular circumstances of that case.</P>
    <P>The first test, advocated by counsel on behalf of the family, was (and I quote from &ldquo;The Attorney General v. X and Others&rdquo;):</P>
    <P>...If it was established as a matter of probability that the continuation of the life of the unborn child constituted a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother then the conflict thus arising should be resolved by preferring the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General, on the other hand, argued in that case that the &ldquo;true test&rdquo; should be:</P>
    <P>...If it was established in any case that the continuation of the life of the unborn constituted a risk of immediate or inevitable death to the mother the termination of the pregnancy would be justified and lawful.</P>
    <P>It could hardly be clearer, in my view, that the Chief Justice in adjudicating between those two tests was deciding between the issue of &ldquo;real and substantial risk&rdquo; on the one hand, and &ldquo;immediate or inevitable death&rdquo; on the other.  The Supreme Court was not asked in the particular case to adjudicate between health and life.  If they had been, the arguments would have been entirely different.  The conclusions might more readily support the position the Government have arrived at, or they might not.  We are not in a position to know.  What we do know is that it is absurd and irresponsible to use the remarks of the Chief Justice, taken completely out of their context, as justification for these dangerous words.</P>
    <P>That is not the only irresponsibility of which the Government stand accused. <Col N="1940" /> In a statement I issued last weekend, I pointed out that Ireland has many pressing and grave economic and social problems.  They all demand the attention of policy makers and people alike.  It is completely wrong that they should be allowed to be pushed to one side of the political agenda in order to facilitiate this debate, which will increasingly divide homes and communities over the weeks and months ahead.  And for what?  To insert into our Constitution a form of words which is gratuitously offensive to every woman in Ireland, and to every man who believes in equal citizenship.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate, the only thing we can be certain of is that we will be bombarded from all sides by people who are absolutely certain of the correctness of their position.  One of the most dispiriting aspects of all of these issues is the capacity for participants to adopt absolute and fundamental positions about issues where absolutism is simply impossible.</P>
    <P>We will be lectured by doctors who assure us that doctors know best, though we are unlikely to hear from women who have suffered because of mistakes made by the medical profession.  We will be lectured by male lawyers and professors of law who will also know best &mdash; even though they could have no appreciation of the hurt their views can inflict.  We will be lectured by politicians who will argue they and they alone have the interests of the nation at heart, as if the nation consisted of only those who agree with them.</P>
    <P>Throughout all of these lectures, the people most affected by them are the people least likely to be consulted.  They will, in general, be women and girls, many of them in distress or pain, many of them suffering from physical or mental conditions of which we are being asked to take no account.  On polling day, many will cast their votes more in hope that this is the end of the matter rather than in any genuine expectation that they have solved a spiritual, emotional, and physical crisis.</P>
    <P>If this Government were serious about addressing that emotional and physical <Col N="1941" /> crisis, they would think again.  But they are not serious.  This Government are not only willing to play politics with the lives, health, feelings, emotions and beliefs of Irish women &mdash; they seem determined to do so.  And they are determined to do so in a particularly callous, brutal and unfeeling way.  I have not seen in any of the interviews with Ministers that have been broadcast or recorded over the past couple of weeks so much as a shred of sympathy for the agonising dilemma in which so many women find themselves.</P>
    <P>Let me make it perfectly clear where I stand.  I do not want an abortion regime in Ireland.  I do not intend to campaign for the introduction of such a regime.  But it is unacceptable to me, and I suspect to the great majority of people in this country, that no matter what distress or danger a pregnancy causes, no matter what caused that pregnancy in the first place, no matter what the outcome of that pregnancy is going to be, that we should by our laws and Constitution expect every woman in every circumstance to carry that pregnancy to full term.</P>
    <P>Let us make no mistake about it.  That is what this amendment, and the accompanying refusal of the Government to legislate unless the amendment is defeated, really means.  We are going to put into our constitution, if this Government have their way, a provision that will require doctors, and nobody else, to determine what might be a constitutional abortion and what might not.  That is more than an absurdity.  It is an obscenity.</P>
    <P>For the remainder of this speech, I intend to put on the record of the Dáil the detailed views of the Labour Party in relation to the three amendments proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposed amendment in relation to travel in the Thirteenth Amendment Bill is a new subsection (presumably 40.3.3ºi) to read as follows:</P>
    <P>Subsection 3º of this Section shall not limit freedom to travel between the State and another state.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1942" /> The wording proposed by the Government presumes that there is a right of travel but is this correct?  Such a general right is not referred to in the Constitution anywhere.  We will be putting an amendment on Committee Stage of this Bill to insert a positive right to travel in Article 40.3.2º</P>
    <P>The amendment must also protect the right to receive a service lawfully available elsewhere, as well as simply the right to travel, and we will be putting down amendments to that effect also.</P>
    <P>The courts have held that the unborn is implicitly protected by other provisions of the Constitution, apart from Article 40.3.3º.  I refer to statements in McGee v. Attorney General and Norris v. Ireland). So these other provisions could be relied on in a travel injunction case, since the amendment relates only to limiting the scope of Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    <P>The wording proposed by the Government in the Fourteenth Amendment Bill is:</P>
    <P>Subsection 3º of this section shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state.</P>
    <P>Again, this wording is negative rather than affirmative.  It does not create a right to give and receive information.  Neither does it prohibit the Oireachtas from banning information.  It is unreasonable to expect people to vote on this without an idea of the conditions to be laid down by law.  In addition, it is essential to protect the right to counselling and to assistance as well, and we will be putting down amendments to try to achieve that.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps another indication of the haste with which this legislation has been brought before the House that we were informed this afternoon by the Minister for Justice that his colleague at some time during this debate will give some draft ideas on the legislation that will be introduced. That is not good enough.  This issue is far too serious and urgent for the House to wait upon draft legislation to be put before us by the Minister for <Col N="1943" /> Health.  If the Government had been organised in what they were doing, that legislation, even in draft form, would have been before the House prior to the commencement of this debate.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;another state&rdquo; in that Bill should be &ldquo;another jurisdiction&rdquo; since, for example, abortion is generally unlawful in parts of the state of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) but is generally lawful in the jurisdiction of England and Wales.</P>
    <P>Even a cursory examination of these two Bills, which we support in principle, reveal bad and sloppy draftsmanship which must, in our view, be corrected on Committee Stage if the amendments contained in them are to serve the long-term purpose for which they are intended.  But the mistakes in these Bills pale into insignificance baside the truly draconian meanings and interpretations which potentially can arise from the Twelfth Amendment Bill, the substantive issue, with which I now propose to deal.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the proposed changes to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution represent an intensely sensitive issue, which involves the lives, health, feelings, emotions, and beliefs of every Irish woman and girl.  These changes must be examined carefully in that light. So far, the confusion spread by the Government's different interpretations of what the proposed text means has only served to illustrate now little consideration has been given by Ministers to so sensitive an issue.  It was absolutely appalling to witness the different interpretations given in the hours immediately after the wording was presented.  It showed yet again the lack of discussion and proper preparation by the Government before publishing the wording.</P>
    <P>It is worth making the point at this stage, in case there is any misunderstanding about it, that this Bill was not required by the joint declaration signed by the four party leaders prior to the Maastricht referendum.  It was the Labour Party which drafted the relevant passages of that declaration dealing with <Col N="1944" /> these issues.  We were careful to make a clear distinction at the time between, on the one hand, the agreed determination of the four party leaders to copperfasten rights of travel and information, and on the other, the right of the Government to bring forward proposals for legislative and/or constitutional change when the Cabinet sub-committee had finished its work.</P>
    <P>All the evidence suggests that the Cabinet sub-committee did no serious work whatever on this issue.  It seems instead to have functioned as nothing more than a vehicle for the rivalry between the two political parties in Government, with the smaller party allowing themselves to be rail-roaded into decisions they clearly did not support.</P>
    <P>Indeed, according to my information, at least one of the members of the sub-committee, the night before the Government meeting which finally decided the issue, was discussing a quite different form of words with a delegation he met. If that is an indicator of how little concern was being shown by the sub-committee to getting it right, it is no surprise that the Government have ended up in the present mess.</P>
    <P>This confusion also serves to make the point that it is almost impossible to legislate for a complex set of circumstances by seeking to insert one sentence into the Constitution.  The ultimate outcome of the so-called &ldquo;Pro-life Amendment&rdquo; foisted upon us in 1983 is further proof, if proof is needed.</P>
    <P>As a result of all this cheap internal politics, the Government are proposing to add words to the existing provision of the Constitution, so that, <i>in toto,</i> Article 40.3.3º would read as follows:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.  It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where <Col N="1945" /> there is an illness or disorder of the mother which gives rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction.</P>
    <P>According to statements made by the Government this wording accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in the X case, in respect of everything except the threat of suicide.  Of course this is a distortion of what happened in the Supreme Court.  The net, basic, effect of the Supreme Court decision in the X case was that an abortion is permissible in this jurisdiction in certain circumstances defined by the court.</P>
    <P>The bottom line effect of the amendment, whatever Government Ministers may argue is this: if this amendment is accepted, the Constitution will provide for the carrying out of legal abortions in certain circumstances.  The principle of legal abortion is, therefore, being proposed for insertion into our Constitution. However, the situation is not nearly as simple as appears from this description of the effect in principle.  The circumstances in which abortions may be carried out are far from clear &mdash; and it is entirely possible that the amendment, as it is drafted, may in fact render illegal certain operations which may be lawful now.</P>
    <P>Almost every single word in the Government's proposed amendment is loaded with potential meaning.  No one can predict at this stage whether or not this issue will become the subject of litigation in the future, or what the result of litigation will be.  What is clear is that statements of &ldquo;Government intent&rdquo; are a meaningless basis for predicting the outcome of any future test by the Supreme Court.  The words will be judged on what they mean, and not on what the present Government would like them to mean.</P>
    <P>The principal dangers in the form of words proposed by the Government lie in the following words: &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;, &ldquo;save&rdquo;, &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;, &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;, &ldquo;not being at risk of self-destruction&rdquo;. The potential meaning and consequence of each of these words, both <Col N="1946" /> individually and taken all together, could place many women at risk.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; in this context implies restrictiveness.  The essential meaning of the word is to imply that terminations would only take place where they are absolutely unavoidable. While many would agree with this in principle, in practice it could lead to situations where necessary terminations are delayed until a medical emergency has occurred.</P>
    <P>This is compounded by the use of the term &ldquo;save the life&rdquo;.  It is easier to understand the potential meaning of this term if it is contrasted with an alternative &mdash; for example, &ldquo;protect the life&rdquo;.  One protects someone's life from the probability of a medical emergency happening in the future.  One saves someone's life from the consequences of that emergency.  For instance: a woman with cardiac disease becomes pregnant.  Her doctor is satisfied that at some stage during the stress of a pregnancy, her life may be at serious risk from a heart attack.  In a regime devoted to protecting her life, immediate or early termination of the pregnancy would be an option.  In a regime aimed at saving her life, termination could also be an option &mdash; but perhaps not until the heart attack was imminent or had already happened.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;As distinct from the health&rdquo;, has attracted so much comment and apart altogether from the innate offensiveness of this term, which implies that the health of women is not an area of concern, and is redolent of a controversy in this State forty five years ago, the use of this term is very dangerous for women.</P>
    <P>To take a similar example, this time involving a woman suffering from high blood pressure, if it was the medical opinion in her case that she was unlikely to die as a result of a pregnancy, but was at serious risk of a debilitating stroke, it might not be possible to recommend a termination &mdash; since it would be her health, and not her life, in the literal sense, that would be at risk.</P>
    <P>One could go further.  The use of the term &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; could <Col N="1947" /> also rule out operations that would be perfectly legal now, if they were necessary to save the health, as distinct from the life, of a woman.  In other words, in any situation where it is &ldquo;merely&rdquo; the health of the woman that is at risk, both &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; abortion could be illegal.</P>
    <P>To take an example.  Suppose a newly pregnant woman is involved in a serious car accident, which involves extensive damage to her spine and lower back, internal bleeding, and so on.  While her condition can be stabilised and maintained, extensive and immediate surgery is necessary to ensure that she will walk again.  There may be the risk that the foetus in her womb will be inadvertently killed or damaged in the course of the surgery.  This would be what the &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; movement call an indirect abortion. It is only necessary to save the health, that is, the ability to walk, of the mother. It is entirely doubtful that it could be regarded as legal under the proposals put by the Government before this House.</P>
    <P>Taken together, these phrases &ldquo;necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother&rdquo; also mean that there will be a number of grey areas, where it is impossible to be certain that mothers at risk to their health will be fully protected.</P>
    <P>For example, if chemotherapy is withheld from a pregnant woman in the early stages of cancer, that will not, in the immediate sense, literally threaten her life, but it will aid the progression of the disease, and will almost certainly shorten her life.  Since the proposal is to allow women's lives to be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; rather than protected or prolonged, it is entirely arguable that this provision will rule out terminations in &ldquo;life-shortening&rdquo; situations, and allow them only in immediate &ldquo;life-threatening&rdquo; situations.</P>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; is referred to in the explanatory document circulated by the Government as being necessary to include ectopic pregnancies. It appears that the Government intention is to rule out all forms of psychological and psychiatric disorders.  In reality, <Col N="1948" /> some such disorders do have &ldquo;life-threatening&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;life-shortening&rdquo; physical manifestations &mdash; anorexia nervosa, for instance, can be a very dangerous physical condition, even though its origin is psychological.  Acute or chronic depression can also have dangerous physical consequences for its victims.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government have ruled out the possibility of a termination based on the &ldquo;risk of self-destruction&rdquo;.  This appears to be a blanket ban &mdash; no matter how imminent or certain the risk is.  It denies a termination to the woman or girl who threatens suicide, but it also denies it to the girl who is in a suicidally depressed state and has already slashed her wrists twice.</P>
    <P>This ignores the fact that any decision-making process involving the provision of terminations on the grounds of threatened suicide would involve psychiatrists, psychologists, and possibly social workers, and would have to take account of a wide range of factors.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I have to say that I regard it as both wrong and unacceptable that the profession of psychiatry appears to be treated in this debate as if the opinions of that profession were in some way less valid than those of physicians or obstetricians.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of sneering at the notion of a woman or a girl being a genuine or potential suicide risk, as if it were some kind of excuse.  There has been too much rumour-mongering, and too much innuendo, about the circumstances behind the X case, as if we should not be expected to accept the facts already accepted by a judge of the High Court and the entire Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Only last night, on the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme on RTE, an eminent doctor needlessly and mindlessly repeated the myth that these circumstances were &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo;.  The truth is that there is a substantial body of literature in this whole area.  That literature shows quite clearly that suicide is an occasional outcome of refused abortion. The literature also shows that suicide among pregnant women and girls has <Col N="1949" /> fallen in those jurisdictions which permit abortion on psychiatric grounds.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the literature is of course subjective, but it is also instructive, and perhaps, it is especially relevant to us.  One eminent study, for example, concluded that &ldquo;the awareness of deviance from the norms of the social group may make a suicide attempt or threat more likely&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To put it another way, if a girl is young, or single, or the victim of a sexual assault or incest, and becomes pregnant, she is going to be far more vulnerable to psychological or psychiatric damage. That damage can be compounded far more by her religious or cultural beliefs, or the beliefs of those whose support and approval she needs, than it would be by, for example, her financial circumstances. A girl in this situation, even if she is surrounded by love and affection, can find herself totally alone.</P>
    <P>Even though the circumstances of her pregnancy might involve no willing participation on her part, she can come to believe that she has betrayed not only her loved ones, but all the values they have tried to instil.  It is when that girl is entirely alone, isolated from support and marginalised from those she cares about, that she is most at risk.  Are we seriously going to say that she does not matter?  If we make our law as inflexible as we are proposing, that is precisely what we are doing.</P>
    <P>I have a daughter, and there is no law in the land that would prevent me from reaching out to my daughter, or I hope to any child in trouble, to help in any way I could to put that trouble right.  I am not unique &mdash; far from it.  Many Members have children, and all of us represent children as much as we represent their parents.  All of us believe, and want to believe, that if any of our own children need us, we will be there for them.</P>
    <P>What that means is that we must recognise, no matter how painful it might be, that there are times when the only way we can relieve pain and suffering, and remove risk to children, is to rely on the advice of psychiatrists and other professions <Col N="1950" /> who can see too clearly the danger they are in.</P>
    <P>Under the Government's Bill, terminations of pregnancy will never be allowed in the case of victims of rape or incest &mdash; unless of course those victims are also suffering from some highly dangerous physical illness, which threatens to kill them in the short-term.</P>
    <P>The reality &mdash; and it is a reality that we must face as parents as well as legislators &mdash; is that there are some circumstances where rape and incest can result in life-threatening psychiatric conditions.  It may be unpalatable, but unless we want to place young girls, already victims of monstrous injustice, at further risk, we will delete this provision.</P>
    <P>The Government are proposing that no legislation will accompany this constitutional change, even though we now know that all the legal advice available to the Government is to the effect that legislation is also necessary.</P>
    <P>A failure to legislate would place doctors in the position of being the sole arbiters of what was or was not a constitutional protection.</P>
    <P>They would have no immunity or idemnity in making these decisions.  They would have no guarantee that they would not be prosecuted for procuring an unlawful miscarriage if anyone disagreed with their decisions.  They would have no guarantee that they would not be sued if they refused to arrange a termination and the result was the death of a mother.</P>
    <P>This is an impossible situation.  In addition, legislation is also necessary to set out the services to which women would be entitled if the amendment were carried.  In short, passage of this amendment cannot absolve the Government from the responsibility to legislate, so clearly spelled out in Mr. Justice McCarthy's judgement in the X case.  We should remind ourselves of what he said:</P>
    <P>In the context of the eight years that have passed since the Amendment was adopted... the failure by the legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate; it is inexcusable.  What are pregnant <Col N="1951" /> women to do?  What are the parents of a pregnant girl under age to do?  What are the medical profession to do?  They have no guidelines save what may be gleaned from the judgments in this case.</P>
    <P>In future, they will have even fewer guidelines, if these dangerous words are inserted into the Constitution.  Mr. Justice McCarthy also went on to say in his judgment that:</P>
    <P>Legislation may be both negative and positive: negative, in prohibiting aboslutely or at a given time, or without meeting stringent tests; positive by requiring positive action.  The State may fulfil its role by providing necessary agencies to help, to counsel, to encourage, to comfort, to plan for the pregnant woman, the pregnant girl or her family.</P>
    <P>Are we to prove yet again, by passing this Bill, that this House is very good at prohibiting, and hopeless at providing? Are we to prove yet again the this House is prepared to ignore its responsibility to encourage, to comfort, and to plan, in favour of taking the easy way out?</P>
    <P>The drafting of the provisions in relation to travel and information is inadequate, and does not cover the &ldquo;copper-fastening&rdquo; promised by the four Party Leaders in their joint declaration.  In regard to the substantive issue, the words proposed by the Government have a number of consequences that are not envisaged within their declared intentions. While the words do enshrine the principle of legal abortion in the Constitution, one of the practical results could be to rule out operations that are legal at present.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government's proposals on the substantive issue could prohibit termination of &ldquo;life-shortening&rdquo; pregnancies; &ldquo;health-threatening&rdquo; pregnancies and pregnancies which are likely, or certain, to cause the mother to commit suicide.</P>
    <P>No account is taken in the words to the right of women to have their health and <Col N="1952" /> welfare fully protected; the words make those rights secondary to the rights of the foetus.</P>
    <P>The complexity of the issue, the failure of the constitutional amendment to address those complexities, and the difficulty of drafting a constitutional amendment that would address them adequately, make it infinitely preferable that this whole issue be addressed through legislation.  Indeed, it is almost certain that there is no form of words that will not lead to further confusion and litigation in the future.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution is based on the underlying principles of prudence, justice and charity.  It was prudence, justice and charity that informed the Supreme Court judgement in the X case.  In prudence, justice and charity, I say that it is impossible to recommend support for this dangerous, divisive and potentially cruel amendment.  I hope that, in the course of this debate, over whatever number of days and nights it takes place, the Government will change their mind, that they will see the error of their ways and realise that the Fianna Fáil Party do not alone contain all the wisdom in relation to this issue.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the adverse effect on certain businesses which the devaluation of sterling has caused and conscious of the heavy burden which recent interest rate increases have imposed on borrowers, particularly those with high mortgages, calls on the Government:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; to reduce employers' PRSI payments <Col N="1953" /> in respect of those businesses most adversely affected,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to cover the exchange rate risk of those firms which borrow abroad for the purposes of expansion and job creation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to moderate the distortions in cross-Border trade with Northern Ireland by reducing the standard rate of VAT and the incidence of excise duty,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to introduce measures to protect mortgage holders, both in respect of the tenure of their homes and the level of their repayments, either by adopting credible economic policies which will quickly reduce interest rates or by restoring full mortgage relief and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to state its exchange rate policy and explain how all its recent actions are consistent with this policy.</P>
    <P>The Government have made it clear that they have no intention of devaluing the Irish pound.  Whatever other variables there are in economic policy this, they say, is a constant: all other causes must give way.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have stated their position on a number of occasions and we must take them at their word: there will be no devaluation.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this position is not substainable without a quantum of pain and suffering.  We have already begun to pay the price and we will continue to do so for some time.  Interest rates have risen by 3 per cent and are now at their highest level in real terms since the State was founded 70 years ago.  Irish businesses have also paid a heavy price, not only in terms of higher interest rates on their borrowings but also because of the loss of competitiveness for those who are exporting to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything in the course of this debate which will make the job of the Government more difficult in defending the value of the Irish pound but I do want to address what I perceive to be major problems arising from the <Col N="1954" /> situation in which we find ourselves at the moment.  The Government do not have a policy on the exchange rate issue; they have substituted a slogan for a policy.  It is a fundamental of all policy positions that if one wills the end one must also will the means to get to the end.  It is reasonable to suggest that if people desire a certain result they must take the steps to reach their destination and achieve that result.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to proceed, in relation to the question of the exchange rate, on the basis that no fundamental changes have taken place in the underlying circumstances, because it is quite clear that major changes have taken place.  The Irish people have, historically, been hypnotised by events in the United Kingdom; they are so fascinated by what occurs there that they frequently miss the wider implications of great events by over-concentrating on the Anglo-Irish dimension. Every schoolboy now knows that the Irish pound is stronger than sterling. To put it bluntly, it is worth more and many of our citizens watch its fluctuations with a mixture of pride and horror, pride at having a currency stronger than that of the ancient oppressor and horror at the implications a too strong punt will have on exports and jobs.</P>
    <P>If we ignore the Anglo-Irish effects however, the real position is starker than many people realise.  The Irish pound has been revalued by 4.5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis and we are talking in terms of an Irish pound which has gone from a rate of, say, 93 pence to £1.08 today against the pound sterling.  I suggest that that is to focus too closely on the old relationship between ourselves and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The process started in Finland where there was a dramatic devaluation; Italy has devalued its currency by almost 20 per cent, and Spain by 5 per cent, while both the United Kingdom and Italy have departed from the ERM and their currencies are now floating against all other currencies.  When one looks at the position of Ireland against its trading partners the bottom line is that our currency has been revalued by 4.5 per cent on the <Col N="1955" /> average against all comers.  That is the significant fact in terms of policy and not that we are up and down like a see-saw with the United Kingdom, although that is important also.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there was anything in the fundamentals of our economy in the course of the summer, or into August and September, that would have justified devaluation of our currency.  I agree with the Government that the fundamentals of our economy justify the relative value of our currency within the ERM but I do not think that there is anything in the economy either which would justify revaluation of the Irish pound by 4.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what this means in simple terms.  In so far as we buy Italian, Spanish or British goods or goods from other countries which have devalued their currencies we have actually awarded everybody in Ireland the equivalent of a pay increase of about 4.5 per cent, because their trade-weighted purchasing power has gone up by that amount with the same nominal income in their pockets.  The question that must be asked is, do the fundamentals of the economy justify that and can the Government proceed on the basis that they are defending a revalued pound in circumstances where they make no other policy changes.  I would like to hear the Government's view on this matter, as I have not heard anything yet which would suggest that that revaluation will not lead to the Government being forced into making other policy changes.</P>
    <P>In theory we can have whatever currency value we wish.  We could go back to the gold standard provided we were totally flexible about all other economic fundamentals, for example, prices, and were guaranted when the United Kingdom devalued its currency that the full effect of the price reduction on imports would be passed on and that the same would apply in respect of all other devalued currencies, such as the Italian, Spanish and Finnish currencies.  This would be fundamental to supporting an Irish pound at a revalued level.</P>
    <P>In terms of competitiveness, if you <Col N="1956" /> revalue a currency by 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent you obviously lose out on competitiveness in all markets.  Again, in theory, you can pitch the value of your currency anywhere provided there is flexibility in relation to prices, wages, interest rates and all other variables. However the only variable on which I see the Government concentrating at the moment is interest rates.  There has been an astronomical hike in interest rates and I suggest to the Minister of State with special responsibility for trade and marketing that relying on an interest rate mechanism alone is not a sufficient response to a revalued Irish pound and that this is going to lead the Government into increasing difficulty as the year goes on.  In the absence of other fundamental changes in economic policy other than interest rates it is difficult to see how the present policy will not lead the Government into difficulty and to increasing unemployment and redundancies.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear for most of last year that the fundamentals of the United Kingdom economy did not justify the value that they had put on their currency. The pound sterling was placed, when the United Kingdom entered the ERM, at a level that was not justified &mdash; they put too high a value on it.  I think all economists would agree with that now.  I think most commentators would agree that at least from the spring of this year it was quite clear that the British would have to face the reality of the situation and would have to devalue; it was only a question of by how much and when it would occur.</P>
    <P>I was amazed when it was quite clear that a devaluation of the pound sterling would impose a heavy burden on Irish firms exporting to the United Kingdom that the Government seemed to have made no provision whatsoever for such a devaluation.  When it occurred they spent several weeks searching for a response to protect exports and maintain jobs.  I think that is unforgivable because one could not buy an English Sunday newspaper for months which did not make it clear that they were facing devaluation and that this was likely to occur before the end of 1992; yet the Government stood <Col N="1957" /> idly by and seemed to be surprised when it occurred and had no strategy whatsoever to help business exporting to the United Kingdom or to put a mechanism in place to secure the jobs of those employed in those industries.</P>
    <P>The Government were irresponsible in not having a pre-arranged strategy to deal with events which were highly predictable. They are now equally irresponsible in proceeding to maintain the value of a revalued punt without making the necessary changes in economic policy to justify the present more valuable punt. I want to make it very clear that I believe that the Government should support the Irish pound at its present value but, to go back to the red catechism with which the Minister will be familiar, just as prayer without good works does not achieve very much, slogans to the effect that &ldquo;we shall not be moved&rdquo; without making fundamental changes in economic policy to underpin the value of the Irish pound will not work.  They have not worked in the United Kingdom and they will not work here.  I call on the Minister for Finance tonight to set out as quickly as possible the changes he intends making in fiscal policy which I believe are necessary to support the pound at its present level.</P>
    <P>Increased interest rates are bringing the economy to a standstill.  Interest rates are at an historic high and neither the investor nor the consumer is willing to increase borrowing in present circumstances. The prospensity to save is rising and this can only reduce activity in the economy.  To put it more colloquially, I do not know anybody in a well paid job at present who intends incurring significant expenditure between now and Christmas other than normal household budgeting.  Once that happens confidence in the economy is lost.  If people do not borrow and do not spend but save instead, the first line of infantry to go down under that charge is the retail sector, as is happening at present. Whether it is the white goods trade, the brown goods trade, the garage industry, the builder, the plumber or the carpenter, the demand for business activity is evaporating as confidence is lost and <Col N="1958" /> the propensity to save is rising.  I blame the Government for this because they have made no attempt to show that they are competent to deal with the very complex situation with which the country is faced, with the United Kingdom completely outside the exchange rate mechanism and with a floating currency and a major EC partner, Italy, following the same course.</P>
    <P>The group facing the heaviest burden at present are those on high mortgages. I know of young couples in modest three bedroom, semi-detached houses who are facing an increase in repayments of up to £120 a month, but they simply do not have the money to meet those repayments. While arrangements made by certain lending agencies to capitalise the extra liability are welcome short-term initiatives, in the medium term the repayments will have to be met, but many householders simply do not have the income to meet them.  Against this background the Progressive Democrats are continuing their campaign to abolish mortgage interest relief.  Fianna Fáil, as they have done on many occasions in the past three years, are, I am sure, again quite prepared to yield to the expediency of the moment and pay whatever price the Progressive Democrats demand for their continuing support of the Government.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Finance to give a commitment before this debate ends tomorrow night that there will be no reduction in mortgage interest relief in next year's budget.  I ask him to make a further commitment that if interest rates continue at their present level he will restore full mortgage interest relief. Unemployed persons with high mortgages are in particular difficulty.  The number of families unable to pay their mortgages has risen to an all-time high. Health boards are paying mortgage subsidies on an unprecedented scale and, according to a report on the front page of <i>The Star</i> of Monday last, the courts in Dublin alone are processing 50 home repossession applications from the building societies every week.</P>
    <P>Charitable organisations such as the <Col N="1959" /> St. Vincent de Paul Society have been approached by increasing numbers of families in trouble; yet the Government stand idly by and the best advice they can give mortgage holders is to grin and bear it.  They are working on the basis that the increase in interest rates is a temporary phenomenon &mdash; I will reflect on that matter before I conclude my remarks this evening.  As a consequence of the repyment difficulties faced by householders the building industry is coming to a standstill, especially in the house building sector.  Most builders have no plans for new starts and are concentrating on finishing houses on hands.  They are looking to a winter of decline and discontent in which the last of their employees will be made redundant.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the problems faced by business exporting to the United Kingdom.  In recent days the Government brought forward a very inadequate set of proposals which are unwieldy, over-bureaucratic and, in many respects, misdirected.  They will of course give help to a number of businesses in the short term but there is no underlying strategy other than the usual bush in the gap response which has become the hallmark of this Government. The Government should, as a matter of urgency, introduce a package of measures to protect the interests of Irish exports to the United Kingdom and make it possible for them to remain competitive in the new exchange rate circumstances. They should bring forward proposals to drastically reduce employers PRSI contributions in respect of employees in those businesses most adversely affected.  Now that there is again a very significant differential between Irish and German interest rates they should put in place a scheme whereby the Government will accept the exchange rate risk for firms who borrow money abroad to maintain and increase jobs.  Such schemes were put in place in the middle eighties for the agriculture industry and there is no reason why a similar scheme could not be put in place now for our exporters to the UK market <Col N="1960" /> who are facing the prospect of running their businesses at a loss and making their workers redundant.</P>
    <P>It is likely that there will be a significant distortion in the retail trade along the Border with Northern Ireland.  The Government should bring forward proposals in the autumn Finance Bill, which the Taoiseach has said will be published in early November, to reduce the standard rate of VAT and the incidence of excise duty to the rates which prevail on the other side of the Border.  If the Government are serious about their present exchange rate policy they will have to take a series of decisions to underpin this policy by protecting the interests of individuals and firms adversely affected by it.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom, Italy and Spain have devalued their currency and imports from these countries should come down in price.  We import a huge amount of goods from the United Kingdom and while some price reductions have taken place, they have not taken place on as widespread a basis or at the level which the devaluation of sterling would justify. The Government must ensure that the benefits of lower import prices are passed on.  They are not being passed on at present, and our position will be unsustainable unless price reductions are passed on.  Frequently it is said about revaluation and devaluation that what you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts.  We are losing on the swings in the devaluation of sterling but we are not gaining on the roundabouts because the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister of State at that Department and the officials are lackadaisical and are not ensuring that the price reductions which are justified are being passed on to the Irish consumer or to the Irish business who are importing raw material from the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I heard Mr. Fergal Quinn, who should know what he is talking about, say on radio at the end of last week that, while price reductions had taken place across a range of items &mdash; the price of up to 1,200 items stocked in his stores has been reduced &mdash; the reduction was in the <Col N="1961" /> region of 5 per cent while the actual devaluation is nearer to 12 per cent.  It is the Minister's job to see that the reduction in price is passed on to the consumer.  High media profile is no substitute for action, and all the pretty pictures in the world will not protect the Minister from the wrath of the electorate if he does not do his job.  At present neither the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor the Minister of State at that Department are doing their job in ensuring that those who have contracts to import goods are not profiteering by the devaluation of sterling but are quickly passing on the benefit to the Irish consumer. We saw how quickly the firms in Wexford, Monaghan and the Border counties faced the other side of the coin in terms of exporting to the United Kingdom.  I would like to see as quick a response in passing on the price reductions, and it is the duty of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that they are passed on.  To date I have not seen any urgency in the Minister's Department to ensure that this happens.</P>
    <P>More than anything else, it is of vital importance that credible economic policies should be adopted to meet the new situation.  Economic policies necessary to maintain the punt at the relative value it had within the ERM until some weeks ago are not the same policies which are necessary to underpin its new, revalued position.  The United Kingdom devalued because the fundamentals of the economy did not justify the value they placed on their currency.  Our currency has been effectively revalued and the Government must ensure that the fundamentals of the economy are strong enough to justify the increased value.</P>
    <P>There is no easy way forward.  The economic chaos in the United Kingdom shows us clearly that any attempt to return to a fixed exchange rate with sterling is futile and contrary to our interests. Our future is in Europe with our European partners and our policies must be placed firmly in that context.  It is time for the Government to seriously consider making proposals at EC level to advance <Col N="1962" /> the progress of economic and monetary union.  It is in our interests that the proposed European Central Bank is put in place at the earliest possible date so that we can have some direct influence over monetary policies which, in present circumstances, are totally controlled by the Bundesbank.</P>
    <P>I heard the whingeing of commentators in the United Kingdom and I was amazed at some of the comments made by responsible people.  I watched Teletext on BBC about three days after the devaluation and the message was that the pound sterling had thrown off the shackles of the Deutsche Mark and was now floating free&mdash;one would think an escape from Belsen was being described. What was happening?  They had suffered a devaluation of 13 per cent or 14 per cent and were sinking; that kind of state of unreality is something to which we do not want to be attached.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government said very bluntly that neither the Department of Finance nor the Central Bank have much control over exchange rate policies and that, because we are a surrogate mark, the main decisions which affect the value of our currency &mdash; if we want to stay the pace &mdash; are made in Frankfurt in the Bundesbank.  It is time that we put forward a policy position to advance the establishment of the European Central Bank because it makes sense to exchange the nominal but unreal control we have over exchange rate policy at the moment for some real say in a fifth EC institution, where we would have representation, as we have in the courts in the Commission at present.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to act at home by setting out firmly the changes in fiscal policy which are necessary to underpin the new situation and they have also failed to exercise any influence in Europe to ensure that at the appropriate Councils of Ministers alternative strategies are being pursued.  The level of chill now between the United Kingdom Government and the Bundesbank &mdash; and by extension the German Government &mdash; will only be got round when a new institution is put in place in Europe and <Col N="1963" /> the Italians and the British are given an opportunity to rejoin the ERM on the understanding that exchange rate policy will be controlled by the European Central Bank, in effect the fifth institution of the Community, rather than by the Bundesbank with whom they have been in conflict so recently.  It is in our interests to advance the progress of economic and monetary union; it is also in our interests that the proposed European Central Bank is put in place at the earliest possible date so that we can have some direct influence over monetary policy which, as I said, in present circumstances is almost totally controlled from Frankfurt.</P>
    <P>We have broken the link with sterling but we have yet to break the link of over dependence on the United Kingdom market.  It is important that we diversify in other markets, I am sure the Minister of State &mdash; as Minister responsible for trade &mdash; will take this point.  It is a fundamental of monetary policy that those countries to whose currency one's own currency is attached must also be one's main trading partners.  We are in danger of doing the splits, of riding two horses in opposite directions, if our main trading partner continues to be the United Kingdom in circumstances where their currency is see-sawing and we are fixed to the German Mark.  It must be a fundamental policy that our currency is attached to currencies of countries which are our main trading partners.  I did not expect the Minister of State to be here tonight but she should take that advice, it is particularly appropriate to her because she has the opportunity to influence the pattern of trade and see that it is diversified.</P>
    <P>Our motion also asks the Government to state their exchange rate policy and to explain how all their recent actions are consistent with this policy.  I do not want to dwell to any great extent on this aspect of the motion but I should like the Minister to deal with this in his reply &mdash; my remarks are addressed to the Minister for Finance.  In particular, I should like him to explain why in late August of this year, the Government and the Central Bank <Col N="1964" /> cast doubt on Ireland's exchange rate policy by allowing the exchange rate &mdash; which had been fixed for almost six years at approximately 2.68 DM to the Irish pound &mdash; to drift to 2.62 DM after tracking it at 2.68 DM for five and a half years.  That was the first signal that the Irish authorities were contemplating a change in monetary policy and it was a most unfortunate signal to give, just three weeks before the major currency crisis descended on Europe and put so much pressure on the Irish pound among other currencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as I want to allow Deputy Cotter to speak.  His Border constituency is badly affected by prices in the mushroom industry in particular. I should like to say a few words about agriculture and food in endorsing everything which the last speaker said.  I want to address myself particularly to the Minister of State, and her Department, in relation to the market development fund and to bring to her attention &mdash; and that of the Minister for Agriculture and Food who seems to be sleepwalking through this nightmare for the food industry &mdash; the fact that the three principal conditions attached to the market development fund scheme virtually exclude the entire agriculture and food sector.  The first condition states that you must be paying 10 per cent corporation tax, which excludes every farmer and mushroom grower because they are sole traders operating on direct income tax, they are not in the 10 per cent corporation tax regime.  Pigmeat and sheepmeat are the other two principal sectors affected; I am told by processors that they will not be eligible because the 15 per cent labour content condition is too high to include them.  We have seen 8,000 sheep farmers in Molesworth Street today, they are facing the lowest prices for sheep and lamb in 16 years.  Leaving aside the fact that the Minister has done nothing for them in relation to the ewe premium, we can see that the difference between the French and British lambs on the Paris market is £6; the price of British lamb is now more competitive to the tune of £6 <Col N="1965" /> and a depressed price of 70p per pound for lamb is uneconomic.  It is not possible, even with the most refined breeding methods and the most efficient production methods, to make money at 70p per pound.  There are 52,000 sheep farmers in this country, a ewe flock of 4.7 million created 1,500 jobs in the sheep processing sector which will go down the tubes unless the Government act.</P>
      <P>There are 5,000 employees in the mushroom industry in a sector worth £55 million.  The margin of the industry was not 6 per cent and we have now had 14 per cent devaluation.  There are fixed prices and they also face the prospect of being undercut by local British mushroom growers and losing market share. However, they are told they are not eligible to be helped.  They have been very hard hit by the new PRSI regulations this year, the sensible thing would have been to implement what is in this motion &mdash; to give an exemption for PRSI.</P>
      <P>Even in the bigger sectors where there is supposed to be protection in the form of monetary compensatory amounts, MCA's &mdash; that is, a levy on, say, British exports or a refund on those exporting into Britain &mdash; what actually happens is that the refund on dairy products covers only the gallon of milk; the processing costs element is not refundable.  In the same way, there are no MCA's on pigmeat. Because pigs are a &ldquo;walking cereal&rdquo; though, they qualify, but not at the appropriate rate.  What are we faced with now?  From 1 January 1993 MCA's will be abolished, there is to be no protection whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are in the middle of a currency crisis and there is no response from the Minister for Agriculture to meet the needs of this most vulnerable and exposed sector, the largest sector of our economy, and one worth £3.5 billion. There are 150,000 farmers facing a huge decline in income after two years of a sharp reduction in gross agricultural prices and in addition to the grave uncertainty arising out of the Common Agricultural Policy reform.  The increase in interest rates will also have an effect.  It takes 26 weeks for cheddar cheese to <Col N="1966" /> mature, and the 3 per cent interest hike will mean a cut of 3p a gallon in milk prices to those farmers supplying cheddar cheese processors.</P>
    <P>The Minister will realise that the food processing sector have withheld passing on this pain to the farming community because, first, they wanted to determine whether the currency crisis would come right and, second, they wanted to find out whether the Market Development Fund would help them.  It has transpired that they are not eligible for assistance from the Market Development Fund and the exchange rate is now £1.09 sterling to the punt.  Farm incomes will be severely depressed because the food processing sector cannot hold back any longer.</P>
    <P>I hope my remarks will be brought home to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I cannot understand how he is so oblivious to the hardship being experienced and I ask him, collectively with the Government, to act immediately to ensure a fair deal for the food processing sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion wholeheartedly.  I support also Deputy Noonan in his critical analysis of how thing in the economy are today and how they should be.</P>
      <P>I will be much more parochial in what I have to say because what I want the House to know is the way things are on the ground.  It is very important that the Minister and the Government do know exactly what is happening, where it is happening and what remedies they can apply.</P>
      <P>Of course, there are mixed emotions about current exchange rates.  People are very proud of the fact that the punt has increased in value.  People in the Border corridor in particular are hurrying north with their punts and, even without arguing the point, are being offered 6p of a premium.  When they do argue they are offered even better terms.  It is quite natural for people to be proud and it is quite natural for them to take their money north as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the currency crisis erupted some weeks ago the Government decided, in <Col N="1967" /> the best interests of this country, to take a particular course of action.  Deputy Noonan of my party, supported the Government in their decision not to devalue the currency.  The good reasons for that were that devaluation would reduce the standard of living for everyone in this country, would upset the balance of trade, would fuel inflation and would probably add a couple of billion pounds to our national debt.  Those reasons are generally acceptable.  Devaluation would have cost the country a huge amount of money.</P>
    <P>However, because one-third of our exports end up on the UK market one could say, very simplistically, that one-third of our jobs in the manufacturing sector are at serious risk.  I know from my own investigations and from the contacts I have had with industrialists and others in the economy that a relatively huge number of jobs is at risk.  Nowhere is that more so than in my own constituency and in the Border corridor in general. There we are attacked on various fronts, whereas other parts of the country might not be in the same predicament right across the board.</P>
    <P>Everyone in the House must know of the modern satellite industries that have grown up in Monaghan and, to some extent, in Cavan.  For example, there are the poultry, egg and mushroom industries. In our area we produce an extraordinarly high proportion of the total native product in those sectors.</P>
    <P>We can very proudly state that the mushroom industry is the brightest jewel in this economy.  It has attained a market share in England of about 30 per cent. I doubt whether anybody in the House could name another industry that has achieved that kind of market penetration. It is also to be noted that that has been achieved at the top level, in the multiples.  This has happened primarily because we concentrate on quality, service and prompt delivery.  Today, though, the mushroom industry is in tatters. Marketing groups and growers alike are now taking losses they cannot sustain. Unless adequate support is provided for <Col N="1968" /> both the marketing companies and the growers, our finest industry will collapse. I have been saying that to the Minister and I shall continue to do so.  I ask the people on the ground to get that information moving up to Leinster House as well, so that everyone here knows about it.  Neither the marketing companies nor the growers can exist without each other. The House knows that jobs have already been shed in the mushroom industry. Unless the growers are kept in business the marketing companies will have no product to sell.  Under the current terms of the Market Development Fund the growers will not get support.  I predict that unless the criteria are changed to allow the provision of support for mushroom growers the industry will collapse very soon.  Growers have been taking a cut in margins since early in the year, since sterling began to weaken.  Summer production is always poor and this year it was bad.  The collapse of sterling came at a time when the growers and the marketing companies were least able to cope with it.  One would have to say that the collapse in sterling amounted to kicking the producers when they were down.  I call on the Government to ensure that support for this sector will come, and will come soon.</P>
    <P>It came to my attention recently that the EC is objecting to the provision of support to companies in receipt of MCAs.  My area has a very strong poultry industry.  The MCAs paid out would amount to about 1.3p per kilo&mdash;an insignificant and useless amount in view of the difficulties that have to be sustained. Poultry exporters are taking huge losses and I am informed by industry sources with whom I am in contact on a regular basis that very soon poultry exports will come to a halt.  Companies have already prepared contingency plans.  In order to survive they have to cut costs.  How do they propose to do that?  They propose to discontinue exports that are costing them money and also to shed jobs.  Companies have their plans on paper at this stage.  They are wise; companies should try to survive in the midst of this crisis. There is also a very strong poultry industry <Col N="1969" /> north of the Border and it is already infiltrating the market in the south by offering attractive price reductions because it is in a position to do so.  The poultry sector supplying the home market is preparing for chaos.  Certainly the industry is feeling very isolated at present.  Those involved feel that they will get no support.  The Government must examine the programme and must change its terms if necessary in order to ensure that support is given to that industry.</P>
    <P>I make the same appeal on behalf of the egg industry, the clothing industry and the furniture industry, all of which industries are suffering heavily and all of which are very strong in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Devastation is coming from another source as well.  I have already mentioned that people are crossing the Border with their Irish money because a premium price is paid for it.  Business people in the Border corridor are now faced with losing Christmas trade.  It will be very sad if that happens.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Noonan in his call to the Government to immediately reduce the standard rate of VAT and excise duties to the levels pertaining in the North.  That measure would go some way in assisting our people to stay in business during this very difficult period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask one specific question and then I shall finish. Has the Minister for Finance asked the EC for permission &mdash; if that is necessary &mdash;to apply a fair exchange rate on a daily basis for the purpose of calculating VAT at point of entry?  Yesterday the Minister was charging an effective rate of 22.6 per cent.  That Minister has been asking importers, wholesalers, retailers to pass on the benefits of sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to conclude as his time has expired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>How can he continue to <Col N="1970" /> do that while at the same time he is putting pressure on people who are reexporting and on retailers, particularly in Border areas, by increasing the price of their products?  He should immediately negotiate a position, if it is necessary to do so, because obviously there was a change when sterling left the ERM. Therefore, it is essential for us to make whatever changes are necessary to ensure that we survive.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the firm exchange rate policy of the Government and the response of the Government to the recent turbulence in financial markets and welcomes, in particular, the measures taken by the Government to alleviate the adverse effects on Irish businesses of the sharp and sudden depreciation of sterling within a framework of continuing budgetary discipline&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was very interested to hear the views put forward by Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> and echoed by Deputies Yates and Cotter.</P>
      <P>The recent turmoil in the currency markets, and especially the effects of the devaluation of sterling, raises serious questions about how we, as a Government and as a nation, go about dealing with major international economic disturbances which cause shock waves in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret having to say that the motion proposed by Fine Gael tonight represents the quick fix, machine gun approach to economic policy which leads nowhere except into a spiral of higher Government <Col N="1971" /> borrowing, higher interest rates and higher inflation.  The motion before us is an all things to all men and women and do not ask the cost approach.  As an approach to economic management and action, it contrasts poorly with the Government's response to the currency turmoil.</P>
    <P>As the Government's amendment states, we have pursued a firm exchange rate policy and we have taken specific and targeted measures to alleviate the adverse effects on Irish business of the sharp and sudden depreciation of sterling within a framework of continuing budgetary deicipline.</P>
    <P>In the middle of September, the European Monetary System experienced greater pressures than ever before.  So severe was the buffeting it received that two of its members suspended their participation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. This was the first time any member had done so.</P>
    <P>The effect of the currency devaluations which followed, particularly the sharp fall in the value of sterling, posed real and immediate problems for many of our firms.  It also raised serious questions about the position of our currency.  The options facing the Government were to stand our ground or to deliver our currency immediately.  I welcome the restated affirmation of our stand expressed by Opposition Deputies this evening.</P>
    <P>For several years, the Government have pursued a consistent line in regard to their exchange rate policy.  Our aim has been, and continues to be, a firm and stable exchange rate within the narrow band of the EMS.  Our capability to sustain this position has been recognised consistently by our Community partners and has been reflected in the increasing interest on the part of foreign investors in Irish Government securities in recent years.  Earlier this year, following a rigorous examination of the Irish Economy, the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers unanimously endorsed the position of the Irish Government and paid public tribute to the good management of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> The withdrawal of sterling and the lira from the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS and the devaluation of the peseta has created further fears in the market that the EMS might break up, thereby fuelling further speculation against the Irish pound as well as other EMS currencies.</P>
    <P>Only massive intervention by the Central Banks of the member states utilising also the mutual support provisions of the exchange rate mechanism prevented the dissolution of the EMS.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Irish pound the Government have acted promptly to stop entirely unwarranted speculation against our currency.  There were no good financial or economic reasons for such speculation and the Irish currency was subjected to deliberate and unjustified undermining for huge and speculative gains.</P>
    <P>The Government as a whole, and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in particular, have held a firm policy line on maintaining our currency within the ERM.</P>
    <P>There are many good reasons why it is important that Ireland remains part of a hard currency regime within the ERM. Holding the brief of Minister responsible for Trade and Marketing, I would like to refer to just some matters which are important from an industrial development point of view.  Firm currency policies in recent years have contributed to competitiveness and allowed our trade with the rest of Europe to increase dramatically.  I wish there could be more toing and froing in the debate but this is not allowed for in set speeches.  I find I have to restrain myself not to contribute to debates as they are taking place.</P>
    <P>I should like to take up a point made by Deputy Noonan in regard to over-dependency on a particular market.  Over the past 20 years we have, as Deputy Noonan will be aware from his time in the Department of Industry and Commerce, dramatically diminished our dependency on the UK market but not as much as one would wish.  As I said on Thursday last in the debate on the market development fund, one could only shudder at the <Col N="1973" /> consequences if we were still 66 per cent dependent on the UK market for our exports.  There has been greater emphasis on seeking out markets within other countries and that will have to continue. Excellent programmes are prepared by An Bord Tráchtála and by various other agencies.  Deputies in various Governments will have assisted in those targeted marketing plans and will have done their share for Ireland, so to speak, in going abroad and encouraging exports there.  I take the point that more can be done and we are progressing along those lines.</P>
    <P>Uncertainly, and the risk of fluctuation, undermine trade and serve to inhibit firms from undertaking costly and potentially high risk marketing initiatives in new markets.  In the market development fund recently launched there is a certain amount of money for An Bord Tráchtála to enable manufacturers and exporters go abroad, and not to count the cost so to speak, to intensify and deepen their links with markets in other countries.</P>
    <P>Nearly £8.9 billion of our national debt is denominated in currencies other than sterling; accordingly a devaluation of our currency would increase the cost of servicing our national debt by almost £1 billion per year if the Irish pound devalues to the extent of the recent devaluation of sterling.  A devaluation now would lead to similar expectations at times of future currency instability and drive away of seek to put up walls against future investment.  It would add a higher risk premium to interest rates in future and discourage industry.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the ERM and adherence to its disciplines has facilitated a significant improvement in the state of our national finances.  Recognising that much more needs to be done to sustain and increase employment we cannot jettison recent progress by now going for a devaluation option.  There has been in the Chamber both on Thursday last and this evening a recognition of that fact.</P>
    <P>One must readily admit that this policy is not without cost in the short-term particularly for firms which are heavily dependent on the UK market.  But the <Col N="1974" /> Government have responded to the needs of those firms in a speedy and focused way.  I take the points made by Deputy Yates about the agriculture and food sector, those made by Deputy Cotter and also what was said on Thursday last about the needs of certain industries. I expect Deputy Leonard will speak tomorrow on the same issue.  I had a conversation with Deputy Cotter after the debate last week.  The flexibilities inherent in the market fund can, I hope, deal with some of the problems raised. Following consultations with Irish exporters, small firms and chambers of commerce, on 28 September the Government decided to set up a working group. After that it was decided to establish the market development fund.  Other Ministers will refer to other aspects of this motion.</P>
    <P>I wish to take up the points made by Deputy Noonan and his two colleagues in regard to the market development fund. This fund is not being operated in a bureaucratic way.  Last Thursday during the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for my Department, Deputy Hogan, and other Fine Gael Deputies, agreed with the thrust of the market development fund.  The change of mind on this between Thursday and Monday is astonishing.  During that debate I welcomed the support given by Deputies on all sides of the House for the non-bureaucratic way in which the fund is being administered.  When I telephoned An Bord Tráchtála this evening I was told that the huge number of applications that had been lodged were being processed. The team, the Department, the Minister, the Government and I want the criteria to be operated in a flexible way so that the fund will respond to the individual needs of firms.  It is very important that this is done.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should telephone the team tomorrow.  Alternatively, I can get the information for him.  There is a huge interest in this fund. There has been great co-operation between the team, An Bord Tráchtála and all the parties in this House in regard to the fund.  It is not something we want to keep to ourselves; we want every Member to be aware of what is in the fund and the expertise available to it.  I thank Opposition Deputies for attending the meetings set up by the team and for the constructive manner in which they addressed the issues raised.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is trying very hard to draw back the full support given to the fund by Members of his party last Thursday.  It is an amazing <i>volte-face.</i> I suppose I should not be amazed at this <i>volte-face</i> as they are good at doing this.</P>
      <P>By 9 October the team drawn from seven State agencies and Government Departments needed to manage the operation of the fund which was in place. We introduced a Supplementary Estimate, which was agreed by all sides of the House, to enable £20 million of the £50 million to be paid from the fund during the current year.  The establishment of the market development fund has received widespread support.  The sequence of events which I have described is one of clear positive action by the Government, concentrating on the key issues and harnessing our resources to the greatest possible effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key objectives of the market development fund is to target support on those firms which are at greatest risk and which are prepared to demonstrate a willingness and an ability to manage their way out of their difficulties.  The assistance provided will be of a short-term nature and will in no way relieve the firm of the need to make the necessary adjustments.  The financial and trading <Col N="1976" /> criteria which the team are applying have been designed to focus support on the firms most seriously affected by the recent currency devaluation.</P>
    <P>This targeting of Exchequer resources contrasts vividly with the kind of approach suggested in the Fine Gael motion.  At first glance their proposal to reduce employers' PRSI appears an attractive option.  However, the working group who advised the Government on the options available rejected this approach in the current circumstances for a number of reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy listen to me?  First, expert advice indicated that the PRSI system was unsuited to the kind of case by case relief which will be possible under the market development fund. Fine Gael refer to this in their motion. Second, the PRSI system is firmly enshrined in legislation and going down the PRSI route would not enable the Government to now provide quick and flexible assistance to firms.  The PRSI system could only provide assistance of up to £30 per week for each employee compared to assistance of £50 per week for each employee under the market development fund.  The assistance provided from the PRSI system would have been greatly short of what is now available under the market development fund.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to the points made by Deputy Noonan in regard to consumers.  I did not like the Deputy's reference to pretty pictures; it was a sexist remark.  Not only have I spoken about consumers' rights on several occasions but I have taken action on the right of consumers to share in the positive aspects of the present currency turmoil.  The Deputy said we were taking no action in this regard and yet Deputy Cotter said he would resist any threat by the Minister for Finance to importers who were not passing on the positive aspect of the currency turmoil in terms of lower prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not miss the point; I caught it very clearly.  The fact is that there has been a concerted consumer-geared consensus in the Government &mdash; we have referred every day to the rights of consumers to lower prices.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan knows, before he came into the Department of Industry and Commerce in January 1986, Deputy John Bruton introduced measures which abolished offices to which consumers used go to complain about prices.  This was done in the greater need for competition and the creation of the right climate. I regard it as a duty of the Government to ensure that the price decreases are passed on to consumers. Like Deputy Noonan, I am not at all happy that this is being done satisfactorily. A few hours ago I met with Mr. Willie Fagan, the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The strict monitoring policy which he has pursued for the past two weeks will be continued for a number of weeks to come.  His inspectors have visited many outlets, particularly clothing, electrical, magazine and food outlets. This monitoring is beginning to have an effect, but, as the Deputy said, not enough of an effect.  Last week a Fine Gael Deputy said he was astonished at the remarks made by a reputable representative group that price reductions should not be passed on to consumers.  I share his astonishment at that remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it appears at any stage that there is an undue delay or failure to pass on price reductions to consumers the House can be assured that appropriate action to protect consumers will be taken, including the introduction of price control orders. That is the port of last resort; nobody wants to resort to it.  We have established a healthy competitive climate within the retail sector and we wish to see that continued. <Col N="1978" /> Nevertheless, I strongly believe that consumers should benefit from the positive aspect of the currency turmoil.  I will continue to ensure that this is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing her time with me.  In the current economic gloom it is important that we remind ourselves of one fact, that is, the Irish economy is one of the strongest economies in Europe.  The pressures which have built up in recent times are not related to any failure on our behalf &mdash; we have not over-spent, over-borrowed or been profligate in any way.  We have kept a tight control on borrowing and spending.  As a nation we have been willing to accept all of the pain and hardship that arise from economic discipline. It is important that we restate these factors as it would be easy to talk ourselves from a situation of economic hardship to one of recession or depression.  It would also be easy to take the wrong kind of action at this time, to lose our heads and be precipitated into a position where the results of all the hardship of the economic policies of the past few years could easily and rapidly be undone.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance accurately identified the problems in a recent address to the Dáil.  A loss of confidence in the British and the Italian economies to underpin the existing exchange rates for their currencies led ultimately to speculation, to the operation of a herd instinct in the exchange markets and ultimately to the collapse, first of the lira and, second, of sterling.  German unification and the collapse of Eastern European state socialism led to further pressure on the capital markets.  The position was further complicated by the pre-presidential paralysis which has descended on the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this rich mixture we could add the further spice of the results in the Danish referendum, the narrow squeak result in the French referendum and the ongoing British equivocation about the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, not to mention the fact that Britain, in effect, has no economic policy worth referring to <Col N="1979" /> at present and, in general, their economy seems to be somewhat out of control. The sole economic reality there seems to be that they are content to wander punch drunk from crisis to crisis with no visible evidence that anything approaching a cohesive policy or a cohesive economic thought is likely to emerge from Downing Street, the Treasury or Threadneedle Street in the foreseeable future.  Those are the realities against which the current exchange rate crisis has occured.</P>
    <P>In one sense the Fine Gael motion is welcome in that it indicates, as indeed does The Workers' Party amendment &mdash; it is regrettable that no Member of The Workers' Party is here to speak to their amendment &mdash; that, while the parties are willing to push individual additional measures to alleviate hardship to companies and to private citizens, none of the parties in this House has proposed any radical departure from the overall direction of Government policies.  Therefore, while these motions suggest that there should be some changes and specific measures introduced, measures which the Minister has dealt with more than adequately, the reality is that nobody in this House is suggesting a fundamental departure from such policies.</P>
    <P>When I learned that Fine Gael were putting down a motion on this matter I was mindful of the idiotic proposals put forward in a Sunday newspaper recently by another member of that party, namely, Senator Ross when he advocated that we should hitch our economic wagon to that of Britain &mdash; a question of climbing on the <i>Titanic</i> before she goes under. Senator Ross took the view taken by a small minority of not particularly distinguished economic commentators that we should cut away from what he saw as the high cost of &ldquo;devotion&rdquo; to the Deutsche Mark. Fine Gael's new found Senatorial economic guru scorned the idea that the present exchange rate problem situation would be resolved in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>As I reminded the House recently, Senator Ross dismissed the idea that Ireland's positive trade surplus could have any positive impact on the lives or livelihoods of the average Irish man or woman.  He scorned the idea that our inflation rate of 2.8 per cent could be of any importance.  He chose not to mention the positive state of the nation's finances or the fact that State borrowing had been brought under control.  He choose to dismiss the good and sound economic position of this country as of no relevance&mdash; at best it was entitled to his scorn.  I am pleased to note that in this regard, as with many other matters, my colleague in my constituency is out of step even with his own party.</P>
      <P>By extension the good Senator choose to suggest that we should abandon existing policies in favour of re-establishing our link with sterling and in favour of a devaluation policy.  In spite of the arguments occasionally put forward by escapees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain what that means, but in fact, it is a truism.  It is unusual to find economists in agreement with each other on anything, but in so far as a consensus can be said to exist among our leading exponents of the dismal science here in this country, there is agreement on the reality of the approach being adopted by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, and the Government in response to the current unprecedented situation.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Economic Workshop in Kenmare recently held two debates &mdash; one formal and one less so &mdash; about the proper response from Government to recent events in the exchange market.  By far the majority view as reported in the papers was that the Government had no real alternative but to maintain our present position in the ERM and to avoid any consideration or even discussion of devaluation.  The saner contributors at that conference opposed the view that we should contemplate devaluation or the proposals put forward by Senator Ross and one or two others from the economic fringes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were, however, warnings about the possible consequences of any prolonged period of exchange rate uncertainty with the high-value punt.  The consequences contemplated in Kenmare should be borne in mind by the proposers of this motion.  If, as is possible, a slow down in growth occurs in 1993 it would impact heavily on taxation.  Very low or zero inflation could also, ironically, have a detrimental impact on the State's tax revenues in that the buoyancy which has existed in recent years could dry up and disappear altogether.  Low growth here coupled with a high-value punt and a continued depression in Britain could, and will, make it increasingly difficult to meet job creation targets.  The worsening position in the UK will undoubtedly force more and more Irish women and men to return to this country which, of course, is very welcome but it will put further <Col N="1982" /> pressures on the nation and on our public purse.</P>
    <P>Against this scenario it is hardly logical for any political party worth their salt to come in here and push forward major new expenditure proposals over a wide area.  That is precisely what is being sought in the Fine Gael motion and, indeed, the proposal from the Democratic Left.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are not mindless of the hardship being caused by the present situation.  Job saving measures have been announced in the past few weeks.  A local enterprise fund of £150 million has been launched and PRSI savings to employers and the taking on of more workers have been announced.  There has been an easing of the more bureaucratic elements in the FÁS grants system and specific measures to assist sterling dependent firms here have been instituted.  With Government encouragement and some prodding, lending institutions have taken measures to dampen the impact of the huge rise in interest rates on home buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a nation, we must adjust to a new set of economic realities and one of those is that in the future our closest neighbour and major trading partner is out of the running economically.  It will be painful to adjust to that circumstance but, since 1987, we have shown that if we keep our heads we can achieve proper economic progress.  We must retain our position in the ERM.  Far from following the advice of some of the more exotic members of Fine Gael, we should seek to establish an <Col N="1983" /> irrevocable link with the Deutsche Mark. We must press for further development in Europe towards closer monetary integration, and I acknowledge that members of the Fine Gael Party share this view.</P>
    <P>We must press also for the creation of a European Central Bank in which we would have a real say.  Above all, it is important that we keep our heads at this time.  The Minister for Finance and the Government have shown that in spite of all the difficulties we can keep ours.  If the other parties in this House show the same level of sanity we will make progress in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party will be supporting the motion before the House tonight.  We will be doing so, not particularly because we believe the approach hinted by Fine Gael in their motion is a particularly correct one in all its details but because we believe the Government have failed to spell out any coherent response to the collapse of sterling and to the pressures that has produced in the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, it seems to us that the Fine Gael motion is weak in calling on the Government to spell out an exchange rate policy, thereby hinting that Fine Gael might perhaps prefer some different policy.  The Labour Party do not believe that the Government ought to <Col N="1984" /> have contemplated a policy other than the one they are following.</P>
    <P>There has not been any choice in this matter up to now.  The Government clearly were not in a position to follow the pound sterling out of the ERM on any unilateral basis.  However, that is not, by any means, the same as saying that the Government have managed the situation well, or that options will remain as limited in the future.  The reality is that in the face of the sterling devaluation, the Government's response was stereotyped, unimaginative, and carried out at considerable cost to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>At the time devaluation occurred, we suggested a number of approaches that ought to have been followed once a unilateral devaluation was ruled out.  None of these strategies included devaluation, or anything remotely like it.  We approached the issue on the basis that the long term benefits of European economic integration should not be put at risk for short term relief.  Neither, in our view was it ever necessary for Government strategy to include crazy approaches like offering foreign investors or speculators guarantees if they buy Irish gilts.</P>
    <P>I will give fine examples of effective strategies which we suggested as being available for rapid implementation and results.  I am disappointed that Deputy Roche has left the Chamber as some of my comments may be of interest to him. First, we believe that the Government must take action, if necessary in the context of mini-budget, to protect home owners against the massive impact of increases in the mortgage rate.  The Government must consider, even on a temporary basis, raising the ceiling for mortgage interest relief to a higher level &mdash; say 100 per cent of interest up to a ceiling of £5,000 per annum for a married couple instead of the present figure of 80 per cent of £4,000.  The Government have consistently said that this is a short term crisis.  If that is the case, and hopefully it is, this measure will not cost a great deal of money.  Most banks and building societies have now postponed increases in monthly repayments, to allow time for <Col N="1985" /> the situation to rectify itself.  If it does not, then the option of increased protection for mortgages through the tax code even on a short term basis as I have outlined must be kept on the agenda.</P>
    <P>Second, the Government have mechanisms available to them which enable the balance of the mix of our borrowing to be changed rapidly.  For example, arrangements can be made to increase the foreign component of borrowing &mdash; borrowing in foreign currencies &mdash; and decreasing the Irish punt component. This would not affect the overall level of borrowing but would improve the liquidity of the economy in terms of foreign currencies and would greatly reduce the need for interest rate increases.  After we called for it, the Treasury Management Agency did take some steps along these lines.  We said at the time that if the agency had been encouraged to move quicker and with more resolution, the interest rate increase could have been avoided altogether.</P>
    <P>Third, most of the speculation against the punt was carried out by domestic businesses, and some individual speculators, and Irish pension funds.  Large transactions where Irish entities sell punts to buy foreign currencies can be a breach of exchange controls unless they are carried out with the permission of the Central Bank.  We have consistently argued that the Government should have been ensuring the maximum monitoring and control of such transactions to ensure that exchange control regulations are strictly observed.  Any transactions which appear to the authorities to be purely for speculative purposes should have been and must be forbidden.</P>
    <P>The fourth suggestion we made was that the Government should establish a fund&mdash;part of the so-called £100 million could be used for instance &mdash; to assist targeted business which have been particularly affected by changes in sterling. These would in the main be labour intensive businesses which export to the UK.  I should add that we also congratulated the Government when it introduced such a fund, and I hope it will be successful in its objectives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> The fifth point is that on the other side of the coin, we called several times for immediate Government action to protect Irish consumers from profiteering by a small group of importers and distributors. A department of consumer affairs with only 12 inspectors and with only one public telephone line which operates for minimal periods have neither the staff nor the resources to combat the blatant profiteering which was possible as a result of the fall in sterling.</P>
    <P>A month after the crisis in the European currencies erupted, we have still not seen any real independent analysis of the amount and extent of price reduction on consumer goods.  In the debate on jobs I raised this matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, and he stated that he had no intention of increasing the number of inspectors and that competition would automatically resolve the problem, but that has not happened.  The Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, stated that she will examine and monitor the situation and, if necessary, introduce price controls. That is to be welcomed.  When I raised this matter in the House on Friday last I was told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that one of the products he would be monitoring the price of would be Scotch whisky to check if it decreased due to the exchange rate difference between sterling and the punt.</P>
    <P>We want the Director of Consumer Affairs to spell out clearly and lucidly what he proposes to do in order to protect the consumer.  He has already ruled out price control as a means of dealing with this issue, but has offered no alternative to ensure the protection of the consumer. I am calling for the publication of a comprehensive price survey that will set out the realities and will not leave the consumer in the dark.  Price control should be introduced wherever there is evidence of importers and distributors making a fast buck and ripping off the consumer in the process.</P>
    <P>The Government's response in this area has been weak and inadequate <Col N="1987" /> particularly in relation to the rights of the consumer.  Consumers should now be saving £1 million per day alone as a result of the fall in sterling.  A few days ago I had the opportunity to check the price of products and I was amazed at the difference in prices between Britain and Ireland.  The consumer is being ripped off and there does not seem to be any Government policy to curtail it.</P>
    <P>An issue which deserves to be addressed is the management of these matters in the immediate past.  In the future we must be prepared to adopt a more flexible approach.  Any suggestion that the punt should be unilaterally locked into the Deutsche Mark for all time, as proposed by a number of economists, can only be seriously contemplated by a Government who can ignore the tens of thousands of jobs that will be lost in indigenous industry if sterling falls below 2.40 DM. There is confusion, alarm and panic in the business and indigenous industrial sectors. Even hardened businessmen do not know what to do next.  Some would contemplate devaluation to save their business but we would not favour that policy. We should press for a general realignment of EC currencies in a reformed ERM which would allow the re-entry of sterling.  That is a key requirement.  If the ultimate hard choice has to be made and the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese currencies are forced to devalue against the DM, we will have to follow suit.  That is a totally different proposition from a unilateral or forced devaluation.</P>
    <P>Irish jobs must come before the value of the assets of the financial sector, who have been pressing to turn the punt into a monetary province of the Bundesbank. The one fundamental that financial economists never refer to is the Irish unemployment level, which is four times the German rate and the highest in the European Community.  That is the key issue which needs to be addressed in our exchange rate policy.  We must consider the 300,000 unemployed and the threat to indigenous industry and the agriculture and food sectors.  Those industries would be wiped out if the current <Col N="1988" /> trends were to continue and the results would be horrific.  We must take whatever action is necessary.  We can be flexible for a certain time but at a given point we must call a halt and take necessary action, even if it is unpalatable.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the view that our future is in Europe but we must consider the kind of Europe to which we want to belong.  It would be a major historical miscalculation on the part of any EC member state to believe that the exclusion from monetary union of countries such as Britain, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, which account for 50 per cent of EC output, would not undermine, perhaps fatally, the European Community itself.  This is the possible crisis we are facing.  Many ordinary people do not understand the mechanics of monetary union but they understand that their jobs are in jeopardy because their employers cannot sell their products in Britain.  There could be major closures and job losses, with a consequent loss of status for many people who are struggling to survive.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty cannot be implemented on an <i>á la carte</i> basis.  The Treaty falls unless it applies equally to all member states.  That is the Treaty which the Irish people approved and any change in it would be a breach of contract with the people.</P>
    <P>European Union will not succeed unless it addresses the needs of the 16 million unemployed in the Community, whose numbers will continue to rise unless there are changes in policy.  We have the highest rate of unemployment in Europe.  Emigrants are returning because they cannot find jobs on the continent. Major problems exist in the eastern part of Germany.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new emphasis on unemployment by the Taoiseach at the Birmingham Summit but it was very little and very late.  He and other Heads of Government must realise that uncertainty and unemployment are the twin effects of an economic policy which has exchange rate stability and low inflation as over-riding priorities, irrespective of <Col N="1989" /> the consequences for the level of economic activity and employment.</P>
    <P>Now that we have taken so-called corrective action to reduce inflation and our public sector deficit, the levels of both are close to the Maastricht conditions for European Monetary Union, but our people have paid a very heavy price to bring that about.  At the end of it all we find that interest rates have risen by 3 per cent and may have to rise further to stay with the Deutsche Mark.  Germany's public deficit is well outside the 3 per cent target.  If Germany were to fund more of the cost of unification through increased taxes, Germany interest rates could be reduced, thus helping other currencies to stabilise.  Without a reduction in German interest rates, Irish rates will not come down.  The consequences do not appear to have been taken on board by the Government for a period beyond three months.  That would represent an unacceptable price for membership of any monetary union.</P>
    <P>One very severe aspect of the financial crisis is that people are having great difficulty in meeting their mortgage payments. Some people told me at a meeting last night that this is the straw that will break their backs.  For many people an increase of up to £80 per month is a critical problem.  The holding off by the banks and building societies is delaying the evil day but unless something radical happens these people will have to pay huge sums of money which will put further pressure on their household budgets. All members of families will experience hardship as a result of this financial crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nine minutes to contribute to three Bills.  That is very restrictive but I will address the issues as best I can.  Before the debate was adjourned the Leader of my party described the proposal enshrined in the legislation as a brutal divisive attack on the rights of women and on the idea of a republic.  Those are strong words but they are merited in the face of the propositions that are being put before this House and guillotined through in this truncated debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a principle which has overwhelming support in this land, the principle of respect for life, indeed love of life.  It defines in a real sense our national characteristic.  It has many manifestations. It is manifest in our genuine welcoming of foreigners.  Virtually all who come here comment on it.  It is manifest in our ability to mix with people abroad.  Those who watched television <Col N="1991" /> last week saw the Irish attendance at a football game in Denmark and the way in which Irish supporters are unique in mixing with, welcoming and embracing foreigners.  It is manifest in our generosity in the face of tragedy, when we see the outpouring open generous hearts of the Irish people in the face of Somalia or Bosnia Hertzogovina or in other crises that affect this planet.  Most especially it manifests itself in our sense of community and in our sense of caring.</P>
    <P>That principle of love and respect for life has been distorted and perverted by some.  It was exploited to railroad this nation in 1983 to insert into our Constitution, into the fundamental law of our land, a form of words which purported to mean, in the words of Deputy Flynn, now Minister for Justice as reported in the Dáil Official Report of 2 March 1983 at Column 1576:</P>
    <P>that abortion could not be made legal either through legislation or by a judicial decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>There was no threat of legalised abortion in Ireland at that time, but that was not good enough.  It had to be copperfastening, and what a good job of copperfastening they did.  One would expect some modicum of humility from those who got it so badly and awfully wrong in 1983, but not so.  They have exonerated themselves from all blame for getting it absolutely and fundamentally wrong. Now it seems that it was the Supreme Court who were at fault.  The Supreme Court misinterpreted the views of the Irish people as expressed in the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, or so their view of history goes.  They are wrong.  Subsequent to the X case, and all that flowed from it, it was clear that in an issue as complex, as difficult and as striven with complications as this, the Constitution is not the place to seek to enshrine such principles.</P>
    <P>There is one other principle adhered to by the Irish people.  They are compassionate. Subsequent to the judgment in the X case it was clear that the Irish people love and respect compassion, and <Col N="1992" /> that compassion engulfed the whole nation earlier this year when a child was impaled on a legal hook put there by well intentioned people who were fundamentally wrong in 1983.  There was relief in the country when the Supreme Court judgment was announced and that child was free to act on the advice of her family and medical advisers in her own best interests.  From that decision has flown consequences that have these Bills before us tonight.  It was a judgment on a hard clear case that captured the imagination of the country.</P>
    <P>The issues of travel and information are before us because we have to restate this basic freedom which the Eighth Amendment, as subsequently interpreted, removed from Irish women. More than one woman &mdash; and there is a Government Minister who is a woman present tonight &mdash; has expressed to me their personal outrage at the motion that the idea of free movement has to be put to a referedum of the people and that such a basic right should have to be restated, but that is what we have come to.</P>
    <P>We have fundamental problems with the wording put forward by the Government on the substantive issue.  The Government took six months for internal discussions, presumably with the full backing of the law officers of the land and the advice of the Attorney General's office and such medical advice as deemed appropriate from the Department of Health.  Indeed the Minister for Health is a member of the sub-committee.  At the end of six months they could not even agree among themselves, and the Progressive Democrats, it is now clear, could not agree with the form of words the sub-committee recommended to Government.</P>
    <P>However, undaunted by their inability after six months to even build consensus within the Government they presented their set of words to the Opposition leaders and gave them 48 hours in which to make up their minds or come up with a better set of words as long as they meant the same thing.  That, apparently, is the Government and the Fianna Fáil view of <Col N="1993" /> consensus.  When the form of words was presented to the Opposition leaders with it came a memorandum that purported to be a memorandum of explanation. Within hours of that memorandum being handed over it was being contradicted by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health on television programmes.  Confusion was heaped upon confusion when clearly the Government did not know the import and meaning of the words or were unwilling to spell it out in clear detail.</P>
    <P>The proposed wording makes a fundamental distinction between the health and the life of the woman.  Medical opinion, as we have seen in the last week from the letters columns of newspapers and the calls that no doubt everyone of us have been receiving from concerned doctors, is that they do not want to be left as the arbiters of the distinction between a woman's health and life because if they make the wrong decisions they will find themselves before the courts.  It is wrong to expect them to do this.  The Government's answer to that is that they do not intend to legislate subsequent to the passing of these Bills, if they are passed.</P>
    <P>A clause which causes concern to those concerned with the issue of women's health and rights is the distinction between mental and physical health.  It is a throwback to 40 or 50 years ago that we feel there is no reality about mental health and that mental infirmity or the threat of suicide is some sort of con job that women will pull to get around the view that abortion should only be available when a woman's life is at risk.</P>
    <P>I believe that the words put before this House are mortally dangerous to women and I appeal even yet, that in the hours of debate to come the compassionate Minister who is present in this House will use here influence with Government to ensure that the substantive issue so-called can be dealt with in a compassionate and generous way by legislating in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The debate we are having today, which I hope will continue for a number of days and <Col N="1994" /> will not be guillotined by the Government as was proposed earlier today, is an important one for our Constitution. Almost ten years after the country had to endure one of the most divisive referendum campaigns ever seen in the history of this State, this Government, through a combination of political cowardice and electoral expediency, are risking a repeat of all the ugliness of 1983 by proposing another totally inappropriate constitutional amendment on abortion.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the events since 1983 would surely lead any rational observer to conclude that the sectarian and divisive amendment, which was introduced in response to intensive lobbying by right wing fundamentalist groups, has been a disaster.  The then Leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, Deputies Haughey and FitzGerald, who willingly caved in to the mullahs in Irish society in the hope of securing some electoral advantage, have a lot to answer for.</P>
      <P>Many of the warnings that those of us who opposed that amendment gave at that time about its likely consequences have, all too tragically, been shown to be accurate.  Since the amendment was inserted in our Constitution we have seen it used to secure the forced closure of pregnancy counselling clinics.  This has not done anything to reduce the flow of Irish women travelling to Britain for abortions, but it is has meant that they are denied the skills of properly trained counsellors at what can often be a very difficult and traumatic time.  We have seen a virtual legal witch hunt against students, and we have seen a range of respected medical publications, dealing with a wide range of health issues including abortion forced off our library shelves and copies of internationally renowned newspapers like <i>The Guardian</i> dumped into the shredder.</P>
      <P>We also saw a young 14 year old rape victim subjected to further legal humiliation and degradation by being injuncted from leaving the country by the High Court at the request of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given these events the response of a Government with any shred of honesty or <Col N="1995" /> courage would surely have been to admit that the whole 1983 Amendment was a disaster and urge the people to repeal it in another referendum.  Honesty and courage have never been the mark of Fianna Fáil Administrations, especially in regard to social affairs, and the Government of Deputy Reynolds is no exception.</P>
    <P>While they are proposing constitutional amendments which will restore the right of Irishwomen to travel abroad for pregnancy terminations and ensure that they are in a position to get some information &mdash; how or how much we still do not know &mdash; the Government are going to compound the error of 1983 by proposing another amendment which will pose a further threat to the lives and health of Irish women, and which will cause major problems of interpretation for the medical profession.</P>
    <P>This abortion amendment raises questions about the nature of the Republic we live in, the role of majorities and minorities and individual rights.  The amendment suggests, first, that we are not a republic in the true sense in that the Constitution reflects the values of only one of the religions, albeit the majority one, practised in this State and ignores altogether those who profess no religion; second that the majority are entitled to impose their will on the minority &mdash; a &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; policy which diminishes democracy; and third, that in areas of sexual politics the individual has no democratic choice, or cannot be trusted to make the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; choice, which therefore has to be made for him or her.</P>
    <P>The referendum is being presented as the democratic way to decide the issue. The flaws in this argument were exposed a long time ago in the statement by the Methodist Council on Social Welfare prior to the 1983 referendum:</P>
    <P>It may seen undemocratic to oppose a referendum, but real democracy means an open, balanced society in which there is free play for opinion. Democracy is achieved slowly by a process of growing maturity and tolerance <Col N="1996" /> and trust.  It can be destroyed at a stroke by a doctrinaire edict.</P>
    <P>Real democracy may even be damaged by a popular referendum following an emotive ideological campaign, which may persuade people to vote in some degree for a closed society.  It would be especially unfortunate when we seek a society of open understanding for all of Ireland, that one part of Ireland should be asked to define itself in this respect as a closed society on conservative Roman Catholic lines.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left does not believe that it is possible or appropriate for a modern democratic state to attempt to deal with complex matters of personal morality such as abortion, in the Constitution.  The 1983 Amendment which sought to impose the views of one section of Irish society, who oppose abortion in all circumstances, on those who take a different view was fundamentally antidemocratic and contrary to the principles of genuine republicanism.</P>
    <P>Members of Fianna Fáil, including the Taoiseach, on Sunday last made their annual pilgrimage to the grave of Wolfe Tone in Bodenstown.  Do they ever pause to consider what Wolfe Tone stood for? Do they ever give any thought to the political philosophy espoused by Wolfe Tone?  Have they forgotten, or did they ever know, that Tone stood for a lot more than simply breaking the connection with England?  Do they not realise that the 1983 Amendment and their latest proposal for the abortion issue are totally in conflict with the sort of democratic pluralism which Tone advocated?</P>
    <P>Despite what Fianna Fáil and other right wing groups claim about the Irish people being implacably opposed to abortion, there is no unanimity in Irish society on abortion, there is no national consensus.  While many remain fundamentally opposed to abortion under any circumstances &mdash; and their personal views must be respected &mdash; all the opinion polls taken since the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case, show that the public now acknowledge that the issue is a lot more complex than they <Col N="1997" /> were led to believe in 1983.  In addition, the fact that some 5,000 Irish women travel to Britain each year for terminations, suggests that there are a substantial number of Irish people who believe that abortion is a legitimate response when faced with a crisis pregnancy. This is the equivalent of almost 10 per cent of the birth rate and is a higher rate of abortion than among Dutch women, where terminations are relatively freely available.</P>
    <P>We have a serious abortion problem in Ireland.  The Government may seek to close their eyes to this and to create conditions where that problem can continue to be exported to Great Britain, but that does not deny the fact that the problem is already there.  The interests of democracy can never be served by one group using the Constitution to force its views of a complex matter of personal morality on others who take a different view.  It should not be the role of the Constitution or our laws to impose majority &mdash; or minority &mdash; ethics on everyone.</P>
    <P>A US President, William Taft, said almost 80 years ago.</P>
    <P>Constitutions are checks upon the hasty actions of the majority.  They are the self-imposed restraints of a whole people upon a majority of them to secure sober action and a respect for the rights of the minority.</P>
    <P>He was speaking of the US Constitution but the philosophy behind his comments is universal and is as valid today here in Ireland as it was all those years ago.</P>
    <P>This debate is first and foremost about women's lives and women's health.  One might be forgiven for thinking otherwise over the last few weeks as legal, medical and theological minutiae have bombarded the country.  People keep talking about the &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, but the one person who really is an expert on her own life and health &mdash; the woman &mdash; is being treated with contempt.  The very wording of the amendment on abortion tells us to dismiss her views even if she is suicidal. &ldquo;Go on, kill yourself.  See if we care&rdquo; seems to be the message from the <Col N="1998" /> Government in this proposed referendum.</P>
    <P>Why is there such enormous fear of allowing women some moral autonomy? Do we here in the Dáil &mdash; predominantly men &mdash; mistrust them so much?  We all know that it is still primarily women who bring up children in our society, who care for them, make enormous sacrifices for them and carry the heaviest burden of family welfare in tough times.  Who are we to say that they are not fit to make decision about a life or health-threatening pregnancy?</P>
    <P>The sexual and reproductive functions of women have of course been the subject of taboo, mystery and male control, since the beginning of time.  The direct insight of women into the unique and intimate relationship they have with their own fertility is totally absent from the theology, mores and laws which govern this society, and it is men primarily who for the next few days in this House will interpret what ordered and civilised society must mean in Ireland for Irish women.  The least we should do is acknowledge our inadequacy in this area and acknowledge it with some humility.</P>
    <P>The sexual conservatism of post-independence Ireland is the result of centuries of male perceptions dictating law in this land.  Many aspects of Irish law and the Irish Constitution oppress the civil liberties of women as individual citizens and reflect ancient, sometimes biblical, taboos.  Ironically the very symbol of our nation is one linked to fertility, &ldquo;Mother Ireland&rdquo; in her suffering, a recurrent symbol in the folklore of independence and nationalism.</P>
    <P>The function of maternity is so venerated that it is identified in our Constitution as the focal point of the family, and therefore Irish society.  Yet, our Constitution, along with the theological ethos which still dominates many areas of public policy hardly reflects the social upheavals which have led to women becoming citizens in their own right.</P>
    <P>The roles, participation and input of men and women in society have up until very recently followed strict lines of financial and social dependence for the <Col N="1999" /> woman, due to her role as mother and the needs surrounding it, security, freedom from want etc, in order to nurture her children.</P>
    <P>The increased participation of women in the workplace, and more importantly, the generalisation of safe contraception have totally disrupted the codes which have dictated the respective role of women and men in society.  As women can now postpone, often indefinitely put off, the function of procreation within a relationship, the role of male &ldquo;provider&rdquo; has become less vital in the relations between the sexes.</P>
    <P>Indeed, how many young couples in this country, with one of the highest rates of home ownership in Europe, would not be capable of taking out a mortgage were it not for the financial contribution of the woman who, in order to keep her job, will plan her child bearing?  No one can deny that relations between the sexes and their common role within society have changed fundamentally and perhaps nowhere more than in the area of decision making with regard to fertility. It is time that our Constitution, the laws of our State and this House reflected that reality.</P>
    <P>This amendment is anti-life and antiwoman. The 1983 amendment, which was the basis for the Supreme Court judgment in the X case, specified the equal right to life of the woman.  In rolling back the Supreme Court judgment, this proposed wording gives women an unequal&mdash;and lesser&mdash;right to life than a foetus.  It places major qualifications on her right to life &mdash; qualifications not placed on any other category of person in the Constitution.  It is claimed that this referendum emphasises respect for life, but it actually undermines a woman's right to life.  In this it is profoundly misogynistic and, in my view, immoral.</P>
    <P>The anti-abortion groups like to give the impression that they have a monopoly on morality.  They do not.  To reduce complex moral and ethical questions to simplicities and certainties may be comforting for them, but for most of us, things are not so clear-cut.  Legislators <Col N="2000" /> charged with making laws for all citizens, must wrestle with the complexities of issues and make the best decision we can in the particular circumstances.  We cannot evade our responsibilities by allowing one particular denomination to define morality for the whole of society. Nor can we evade them simply by declaring women free to travel to another jurisdiction for abortions while refusing to legislate for the necessary medical provision at home.  Morality, responsibility, respect for life all dictate that we should face up to this very real and very painful dilemma.  It is no longer acceptable to sub-contract our social problems and moral dilemmas to Europe or elsewhere. It is time, as I said last week, that we stopped asking British doctors to do our &ldquo;sinning&rdquo; for us.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left have said all along that the correct response to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case was legislative action by the Dáil, and everything that has happened since the Government published their wording has demonstrated the folly of attempting to deal with a complex medical and social issue like abortion through a brief constitutional amendment.  There is still utter confusion in Government circles as to what the wording means, with both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health on the record contradicting key passages of the briefing document prepared, we must assume, by the Attorney General.  If there is such confusion among Government Ministers &mdash; and we know that the Government themselves are divided on the issue &mdash; as to what the amendment means, what prospect is there of the ordinary voter being in a position to make an informed judgment on the matter if it is put before the people in a referendum?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, at last week's meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, apparently produced a list of doctors who he said had indicated that they had no problems with the meaning of the wording of the proposed amendment.  It would be quite easy to produce another list of doctors who have indicated that they will have very great problems in interpreting the words.  I have received a letter signed <Col N="2001" /> by nine obstetricians who express grave concern about the possible implications of the wording.  I am sure all the Deputies in the House have received the same letter.  The medical profession is just as deeply divided on this issue as any other section of Irish society.  Despite what the Taoiseach has implied on a number of occasions, the Irish Medical Organisation has no specific policy on this matter.  The real danger is that, if it is passed in its present form, doctors will differ and women may die as a result.</P>
    <P>The decision of Fianna Fáil to go for a constitutional amendment rather than legislation was dictated by political cowardice and electoral opportunism. They wanted to be seen to be doing something so as to appease the ultra right-wing groups who demanded the 1983 amendment, insisted on that wording, and then reacted with indignation when the Supreme Court decided that it allowed for abortion in certain very limited circumstances. With a constitutional amendment the Government knew that they would get away with a fudge, that they could come up with a brief and vague wording which, in the end, would have to be interpreted by the Supreme Court in any event.  They did not have the courage to produce legislation where they would have to spell out in detail what they stood for and what they were proposing. With legislation, for instance, the first thing they would have had to do was define the terms they mean.  Every Bill has to have definitions of the terms it uses.  Even everyday terms have to be defined.  The recent Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill had to contain a definition of a contraceptive.  The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill contained a definition of a spouse.</P>
    <P>I want to challenge the Minister, in his response to this debate, to provide an acceptable definition of the noun &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; used in the proposed amendment. He will not be able to do it, because this is a very difficult question and there is no unanimity among the medical profession as to when life &ldquo;begins&rdquo;.  While the Minister is at it, perhaps he could also <Col N="2002" /> come up with acceptable definitions for the words &ldquo;termination&rdquo;, &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; and &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;.  He is dodging providing definitions of these terms by bringing forward referenda Bills.</P>
    <P>Abortion is one of the most complex social and medical issues facing modern society.  It is ludicrous to try to deal with it in an amendment of 56 words when a relatively non-controversial area like entitlement to holidays requires legislation of more than 6,000 words.  The Government's insistence on proceeding with this amendment is likely to lead to another legal and constitutional quagmire. In the end it will not matter what the Taoiseach or Minister say it means or what they believe it means.  If it is inserted in the Constitution, as was the case of the 1983 Amendment, it will in all probability be up to the Supreme Court to decide what the wording means.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the promoters of the amendment, inside and outside this House, insisted that the amendment would change nothing, that its only purpose was to prevent the Dáil from legislating at some time in the future to legalise abortion. In fact, it changed a lot and, as I said earlier, led to the closure of pregnancy counselling services, the banning of books and magazines and the horror of a young child being dragged before the court.  Nobody can say for definite at this stage what this amendment will result in if it is passed.</P>
    <P>However, what is most incomprehensible to women is the Government's refusal to allow for termination of pregnancy that arises from rape or incest. The myths and stereotypes surrounding violence against women, such as, &ldquo;she must enjoy it or she would leave&rdquo;; &ldquo;she must ask for it&rdquo;; &ldquo;she deserves it&rdquo;, lay the blame on women.  It is a failure of our society that we have not debunked these myths.  Victims of physical and sexual violence of both sexes are traumatised by their experience, but in the majority of cases the victims are women, and it is only the female victime who must bear the extra psychological trauma of unwanted pregnancy.</P>
    <P>How cruel a society we are that having <Col N="2003" /> failed to address the widespread problem of violence against women we then impose a second form of guilt by justifying enforced pregnancy on the woman.  What some have argued is an additional form of guilt, the decision to terminate a pregnancy which is the result of violence, is invented by theocratic beliefs and the taboos they perpetuate surrounding sexuality.  Nowhere is this hypocrisy of society more apparent than in this area.  We deny that our teenagers have a sexual life; we deny them the possibility of responsible behaviour within sexual relationships by denying them knowledge; indeed, we deny that they are sexually active at all.  For instance, we refuse to provide for the sale of condoms through vending machines in public houses and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Most modern affluent societies postpone the time at which a young woman procreates.  We prolong childhood into adolescence, preferring to educate our young women and encourage them to marry only some years after their bodies have biologically become capable of reproduction.  Indeed, their function as citizens does not become official until the age of 18; yet we are subjected to the heinous argument of some who, as during the `X' case, would impose motherhood on girls of 14 or 15 who have been raped. It is a repulsive argument which demeans us all.  During the drama of the `X' case I got many letters urging compassion for that young girl, and one such letter stuck in my mind.  It was from a young woman who felt that a quotation from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet was appropriate in the circumstances, when Juliet's father said: &ldquo;my child is yet a stranger in the world; she hath not seen the change of 14 years; let two more summers wither in their pride, ere we may think her ripe to be a bride&rdquo;.  That was written hundreds of years ago, yet today we insist on forcing young girls to carry the full term pregnancy arising from rape or incest. Have we forgotten so quickly the sympathy and concern for the young rape victim whose case precipitated this governmental response?  Our concern <Col N="2004" /> then was, and our concern now should be, that no girl or woman in that position should be forced by our laws to carry through with such a pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The decision to ignore the particular trauma of rape or incest victims who may become pregnant is particularly inexplicable. Many people, who would oppose abortion in other circumstances, would concede that those who have been the victims of rape or incest should not be compelled to carry to full term such a pregnancy.  The Government apparently want to draw a discreet constitutional veil over the whole problem of pregnancy following rape and incest.</P>
    <P>While there are clearly deep differences of opinion in Ireland and in other countries regarding women's freedom to choose to have an abortion, there is surely no civilised person, man or woman, who would question the right of a woman to exercise freedom of choice in regard to with whom she will have the most intimate of relations.  In acts of rape or incest, women are denied choice.  This House will be compounding the original offence if we approve of a wording which seeks to deny women any prospect of terminating a pregnancy resulting from such a crime.  Society agrees that rape and incest are heinous crimes, but the Government are saying in this amendment that where the victim becomes pregnant, the pregnancy supersedes the crime.  This thinking can only be described as the dark side of civilisation.</P>
    <P>If the three amendments are passed in their present form, the ability of a woman or girl to secure a termination of a pregnancy arising from rape or incest will be determined by the level of her income or that of her family.  If her family has the money to pay the considerable cost of travel to Britain for an abortion, then she will be able to get one.  If her family is poor then what the Government are saying in these amendments is tough luck: we will force you to endure this pregnancy and all the trauma and distress that goes with it; we will force you to carry this foetus for nine months even if every day it brings back haunting memories of the assault on you.  We do not <Col N="2005" /> care what damage it causes to your physcal or mental health, we will do this rather than sully our &ldquo;holy little island&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The use of the words &ldquo;...a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction&rdquo; arrogantly implies that a woman's own feeling and mental condition, even if severe enough to constitute a real risk of suicide are not to be classed as &ldquo;real and substantial&rdquo;, that however serious a woman's mental condition may be, this in some way is &ldquo;not real&rdquo;.  This has echoes of pre-20th century attitudes to mental illness and is completely inappropriate for a Constitution that will, presumably, be a basis for Irish law well into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>We have heard sweeping statements from promoters of this amendment that &ldquo;pregnant women never commit suicide&rdquo;, but the eminent psychiatrist, Dr. Anthony Clare, together with his colleague Dr. Tyrell, have produced evidence showing that the threat is far from imaginary.  It is true that the rate of suicide among pregnant women is lower than that for the population as a whole, and that is because for the majority of women a planned and safe pregnancy is a joyous event.</P>
    <P>Drs. Clare and Tyrell point to statistics in Britain which show that the suicide risk in pregnancy has been falling steadily. Dr. Clare quotes what he describes as a &ldquo;highly respected and cautious social psychiatrist&rdquo;, now Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, Robert Kendall, suggesting that the decline was due to a number of social changes, including the provision of legal abortion and the increasing availability of contraception.  Dr. Clare quotes a Hungarian study involving over 200 women who had attempted suicide while pregnant and found the reasons for the attempt included unwanted pregnancy and the desire for an abortion.  In another American study quoted by Dr. Clare, Dr. Gabrielson and his colleagues reported on 105 pregnant teenagers, 14 of whom had attempted to kill themselves.  They claimed that women who were single, Catholic and not living at poverty level were more likely to attempt or threaten <Col N="2006" /> suicide than other women who had borne children in their teens.</P>
    <P>This research shows that we simply cannot afford to take a risk and totally ignore the reality that an unwanted pregnancy, especially one conceived as a result of rape or incest, can drive a woman &mdash; particularly a young girl &mdash; to suicide.  Last February and March the Members of this House seemed to have been as anguished as the rest of the population about the awful plight of the young girl at the centre of the X case.  However, that now seems to have evaporated as far as the Government are concerned.  In his speech today the Minister drew on medical experts to show that it was necessary to provide abortion, which was not indirect abortion, on the basis that there was a rare risk that, as a result of a heart condition, an ectopic pregnancy or some other condition, a termination might be necessary.  There is also medical evidence that there is a risk &mdash; which may be a rare risk &mdash; that some woman may kill herself as a result of a pregnancy, yet this is being deliberately excluded.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's argument in relation to the necessity for direct termination in certain medical circumstances. However, you cannot then on the other hand rule out other medical circumstances simply because, as the Minister argues, this may provide or may have been used as the basis for widespread abortion in other countries.  Whether that happens in Ireland is a matter for this House to decide.  To ensure that no such risks are taken Democratic Left will be proposing on Committee Stage that the Government's amendment should be redrafted along the following lines:</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of this section shall not limit freedom to provide or obtain, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, termination of a pregnancy in order to protect against a real and substantial risk to the life or health of a pregnant woman.</P>
    <P>If such an amendment were passed and incorporated in our Constitution the Dáil would then be free to legislate for the <Col N="2007" /> circumstances where an abortion is necessary.</P>
    <P>Last week Democratic Left produced a detailed policy document entitled <i>Women's Life, Health and Welfare,</i> which sets out our policy positions on a number of matters relating to sexuality, reproduction and health.  Among other subjects it covered education for sexuality, family planning, women's gynaecological health, AIDS-HIV, counselling services, genetic counselling services for the infertile and termination of pregnancies.  In publishing this policy document we were the first party in the Dáil to clearly and unambiguously set out the circumstances in which abortion should be permitted in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left believe that termination of pregnancy should be made available in the context of the information programmes and services we also call for in our document, where a registered medical practitioner has certified that certain conditions apply and where the woman has been counselled and all options have been fully explained to her. The conditions which would warrant a termination would be any one or more of the following: where it is certain that the foetus cannot survive the pregnancy; where the life of the woman is seriously at risk; where the health &mdash; physical, psychological and emotional &mdash; of the women is seriously at risk and the pregnancy has not advanced more than 16 weeks; where the woman has become pregnant as a result of rape or incest and the pregnancy has not advanced more than 16 weeks.</P>
    <P>We believe that information is the key which enables people to exercise their sexuality with confidence and responsibility. It should be made available through a lifeskills education programme in schools, advice about the full range of contraceptive methods from GPs, family planning centres, etc., counselling services, including genetic counselling for people with particular difficulties and information programmes aimed at particular target groups such as those at risk in relation to AIDS-HIV and other sexually <Col N="2008" /> transmitted diseases and women who should be screened for breast or cervical cancer, etc.</P>
    <P>Along with information, services must also be provided in this country to allow people to make informed and responsible choices.  Thus, a comprehensive counselling service including amniocentesis testing in early pregnancy should be available locally to everyone who needs it, including medical card holders.  Abortion is not and must never be allowed to become a trivial matter.  Abortion should not be used as a method of contraception. But crisis pregnancies are a fact of modern life and totally outlawing abortion is simply to add to the trauma and distress of many women.</P>
    <P>There must be greatly improved support for those women who will decide to go ahead with a crisis pregnancy.  There must be improvements in maternity services; there must be a radical development in the level of child care services; and serious steps must be taken to ensure that all parents are provided with an adequate income and support services. Most of all, if we are serious about reducing unwanted pregnancies, we must have a comprehensive family planning service and education on sexuality in their schools.  One of the reasons there is a relatively low abortion rate among Dutch women is that they have access to a first-class family planning service.  I would be more impressed with those who rail against abortion, if they were prepared to promote comprehensive family planning. But those who are most opposed to abortion are generally those who are also most vociferous in their opposition to any reform of our family planning laws.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left have put their cards on the table in regard to abortion, and I think it is time that all other parties did likewise.  It is clear that Fianna Fáil, as a party, are opposed to abortion in all circumstances, even where the life or health of a mother is threatened, although individual members of the party like the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and Deputy McDaid have had the courage to express different personal views.  But what of Fine Gael, Labour and the Progessive <Col N="2009" /> Democrats?  It is time that all parties stopped sheltering behind constitutional generalities and came out and told the electorate exactly where they stand on what is one of the biggest social issues facing modern Ireland.  Do you oppose abortion in all circumstances?  If not, what are the circumstances in which they believe it should be allowed?  That debate is necessary and it should take place in this House.</P>
    <P>This whole exercise reeks of hypocrisy. The Government have opposed a unilateral deadline to have the referendum on 3 December, which means that the time the Dáil will have to debate it is derisory.  It has not been explained why the referendum cannot be on 3 January, 3 February or even 3 March.  There is a great contrast between the response of the Taoiseach to the Supreme Court judgment in the X case and the judgment on Cabinet confidentiality; for instance in relation to Cabinet confidentiality the Taoiseach said that the Supreme Court had spoken and everyone must accept their judgment but in relation to the X case he said that the Supreme Court had spoken and everybody must reject their judgment.  It is not hard to find the reason for the different approach: Cabinet confidentiality protects Fianna Fáil, abortion threatens them.  They cannot even bring themselves to use the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;, they prefer to hide behind a meaningless euphemism like the &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo;. &ldquo;Abortion&rdquo; is used only as a term of abuse and anyone who opposes a blanket ban is accused of advocating abortion on demand.  This is a cynical exercise by a politically bankrupt Government which will choose to dance with the angles on the heads of women rather than face the reality of the problems which women face.</P>
    <P>The Government will now facilitate the traffic of Irish women to Britain for abortion because they know that, without the safety valve of the British health system. the demand for the introduction of abortion here would be immense.  What of the Progressive Democrats?  Not for the first time, the fate of a measure before this Dáil will be decided by the attitude of the <Col N="2010" /> Progressive Democrats.  People like the Minister, Deputy Harney and Mr. McDowell have been vocal in their criticisms of the Government's decision to have a referendum and particularly of the wording in the Twelfth Amendment. They have pointed to the potential dangers for women if this wording is passed. Apparently the six Progressive Democrat Deputies will vote for the Bill but will not campaign for it and may urge the public to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the referendum. How can they credibly urge people to vote against a measure they will have voted for in the Dáil?</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Progressive Democrats have brought the Dáil to the edge of dissolution and the country to the verge of a general election, most notably in 1990, when the matter at issue was the truthfulness of a member of the Government.  The only conclusion that can now be drawn is that the Progressive Democrats consider the admitted threat to the lives and health of Irish women to be less important than whether Deputy Lenihan told the truth about events which had taken place some eight years previously.  If Government Members go through with this hypocritical charade of voting for something in which they believe it will be the final nail in their political coffins.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I suggest that the Dáil must now do its duty and bring this cynical charade to a halt.  It must protect the lives and health of women and defend democratic principles by rejecting the Government's wording for the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution.  The Democratic Left Party's amendment proposes that the House decline to give a second reading to the Bill.</P>

      <P>In his speech opening the debate the Minister for Justice stressed the duty of the Dáil &ldquo;to ensure <Col N="2011" /> that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken&rdquo;.  The Minister added, &ldquo;we are not prepared to take any chances where the life of the mother is at stake&rdquo; However, the reason that in the House we are discussing three further amendments to our Constitution is that in 1983, for opportunist reasons of short term political advantage, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister for Justice in particular as an Opposition front bench Deputy at the time, insisted on the introduction into the Constitution of Article 40.3.3º, despite the clear warning of the Attorney General of the day that that wording was open to several unintended interpretations. The Attorney General of the time said that one of those interpretations might open the way to the legalisation of the termination of pregnancies incases where such termination had not hitherto been lawful and that another interpretation could prevent the life of the mother being saved in certain instances when under previous law it was protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the X case both of those fears were seen to have been realised.  On the one hand, a Fianna Fáil Attorney General felt constrained by the Fianna Fáil 1983 wording to seek an injunction to prevent the termination of a pregnancy in the case of a rape victim, in respect of whom the Supreme Court subsequently decided that there was a real and substantial risk to her life as distinct from her health. Here we had a Fianna Fáil amendment pushed through regardless of the warnings as to what it would mean and a Fianna Fáil Attorney General going to the courts to insist that that was what it meant and that the right to life of a woman should not in that case be vindicated. He was turned down by the Supreme Court on that issue, although his right to seek an injunction was accepted.  So much for the concern of the Fianna Fáil Party, and the Minister for Justice, to ensure that there would not be the remotest chance of bringing any <Col N="2012" /> provision that would put at risk a woman's life.</P>
    <P>The warning was there from the Attorney General of the day in the clearest possible terms, reiterated by me as Head of the Government, with the support of all members of the Government, yet the Fianna Fáil Party decided to ignore that and it was their Attorney General who subsequently proved how wrong they were.  The Supreme Court decided that a termination of pregnancy was permissible on grounds of a threat of suicide &mdash; a decision which the Government are now seeking to reverse, a decision not contemplated by Fianna Fáil at the time of the 1983 Amendment. At the time, Fianna Fáil told us that that could not possibly happen, that there was no possibility of that Amendment facilitating abortion.  Both fears put forward by the Attorney General of the day were vindicated in terms of what the Fianna Fáil Attorney General sought to do and in terms of what the Supreme Court decided.</P>
    <P>Against that background, the Minister comes to the House to tell us of his concern to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken.  Nine years ago that was not his concern not was it the concern of his party.  Then they were quite unconcerned about the risk to a woman's life that might be involved as put to them by the Attorney General of the day.  That legislation was pushed forward, with the consequences we now witness.  The party and the Minister who refused to listen to the views of the Attorney General in 1983 and who insisted on forcing through that dangerously ambiguous amendment that the Minister now seeks to put right tell us today that we must take no risks with the life of the mother and that we have a duty to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, put a woman's life at risk.  The hypocrisy of those two irreconcilable stances is stunning.</P>
    <P>But there is worse to come, for the amendment now proposed by the Minister <Col N="2013" /> is patently ambiguous &mdash; as I shall demonstrate &mdash; and creates fresh doubts in an area in which the Supreme Court had at last, at least and belatedly introduced certainty.  The Government propose to introduce ambiguity where the dangerous ambiguity of the 1983 Amendment had been resolved by the Supreme Court.  The excuse for the ambiguous words that it is now proposed to introduce is that it is necessary to negative the Supreme Court decision in respect of suicide.  This, indeed, was stated by the Minister in his speech to be the only modification of the court's decision that is to be affected.  He said: that the amendment negatives the decision in respect of suicide but in no other respect.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside for the moment the question of whether the suicide case should be excluded and granting for the sake of the argument the legitimacy of this intention&mdash;it is a difficult issue which I shall come back to if I have time &mdash; the Minister has completely failed to explain why, if this is the sole intention in respect of the substantive amendment, the wording of the amendment, is not confined to this issue, which is in fact addressed only in the final six words.  Given that the existing wording of Article 40.3.3º is to be retained, why has it not simply been qualified by those six words, with whatever linking phraseology may be grammatically required?  The addition of four lines of text unrelated to suicide simply has the effect of reintroducing ambiguity into the interpretation of Article 40.3.3º where that ambiguity has happily been eliminated by virtue of the Supreme Court decision.  One can argue as to whether or not the suicide option should be retained &mdash; that is a legitimate point of disagreement and people from both sides of the House may disagree within their own parties on that issue &mdash; but if that is the only purpose, as the Minister has stated, why do we have four lines of verbiage reintroducing ambiguity where it had been removed by Supreme Court decision?</P>
    <P>I recognise at least three fresh ambiguities unnecessarily introduced by the unhappily worded initial four lines of the <Col N="2014" /> amendment.  Given my experience in 1981 and 1982, when I accepted without legal advice the wording put to me, because, as a non-practising lawyer of now 45 years' standing, I did not recognise any ambiguity in it, and that I subsequently discovered how wrong I was and that the wording that had seemed to me to be innocent and harmless had these dangers, I would have to say, that if I can find only three ambiguities in the proposed wording of this amendment the lawyers and the Supreme Court will undoubtedly find more when they set their minds to it if put to that task by some future challenge, and I have no doubt that they will be.  The Minister has referred to two of those ambiguities; the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to save life and the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the life of the mother&rdquo;.  I must add a third ambiguity, the word &ldquo;save&rdquo; life.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister endeavoured to allay fears that the amendment &ldquo;does not provide adequate protection for women in a situation where there would be a risk of the life of the mother being shortened rather than of her immediate death&rdquo;.  I have several comments to make in this regard.  The Minister relates that fear to the use of the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to save life but he does not address the effect of using the word &ldquo;save&rdquo; life rather than &ldquo;protect&rdquo; life, yet, very interestingly, the Minister chooses to use the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;save&rdquo; when he refers to the death of the foetus &ldquo;in the course of a medical intervention to protect the mother's life or her health&rdquo;.  That is the word the Minister naturally uses, because in his ordinary language he is concerned with the concept of protecting the life or health of the mother.  However, the word used in the text of the amendment is &ldquo;save&rdquo;, not &ldquo;protect&rdquo;.  Clearly, the word &ldquo;save&rdquo; implies a very direct threat while &ldquo;protect&rdquo; has a much more long term significance. I trust that in due course the Minister will accept an amendment to substitute his own preferred choice of the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo;, as evidenced in his speech, for the word &ldquo;save&rdquo; in the Amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2015" /> The terms in which the Minister addresses the issue of whether the amendment will deal with the danger of the mother's life being shortened are in any event, unsatisfactory.  The Minister denies that the threat to life must be immediate for the provision to come into effect and asserts that the amendment will permit a termination where a medical condition would result in an &ldquo;early&rdquo; death.  But shortening a woman's life, while not threatening an early death, could cut years off her life.  The Minister is careful to avoid that issue.  A woman faced with such an alternative cannot avoid it, nor can the doctors who have to decide whether to act and who are left, because of this wording, in a state of doubt and uncertainty as to where their rights and their duties lie.  The Minister's wording and his speech leave a woman, and her doctor, in that serious difficulty. It is simply not tolerable that we in this House should enact something with that effect.</P>
    <P>I stress once again that this and the other ambiguities arising from the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; and from the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health, of the mother&rdquo; are there because, despite the stated objective being to eliminate the suicide case, the amendment, as drafted, contains four additional lines unrelated to suicide which have the effect of undoing the certainty introduced by the Supreme Court in respect of the rest of the originally ambiguous wording of Article 40.3.3. Yet, the Minister has not offered any apparent explanation, let alone justification, for this additional ambiguous verbiage.  What is it doing there?  Why is it there?  If suicide is the only concern why put in four lines?  If they were in substitution for the original amendment. I could see the sense of it, although I might not agree with it, but adding them to introduce ambiguity when the original amendment is there and the only issue in the original amendment that was found to be unsatisfactory in the clarification by the Supreme Court was the suicide issue. Why then put in four lines of ambiguous <Col N="2016" /> matter and offer this House no explanation why it is being done?</P>
    <P>The Minister's and Government's approach to an issue which has been in the past so disastrously confused by ambiguities because of their insistence on the original amendment &mdash; to which this amendment proposes to add a further rash of ambiguities &mdash; is intolerably slapdash. Clearly he and his party have learned nothing from the hash they made of this issue in 1983 in an attempt to pin on this party a label of being proabortion.</P>
    <P>Despite the evidence of the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case, as to the impossibility of prejudging how the Supreme Court will interpret the constitutional provisions, he has peppered his speech with personal assurances as to what the amendment really means.  In the text distributed it is stated:</P>
    <P>I think I can provide reassurance on this point... It is not the intention of the amendment to affect in any way the degree of probability of risk to life that is necessary to warrant treatment. ... There is nothing in the proposed wording which would change that... There is no basis for such fears.</P>
    <P>Who does he think he is?  What have his intentions or his Government's intentions or his reassurances got to do with the way the Supreme Court interprets legislation?  He is not a naive men; indeed, he is thought by many to be subtle, though there is a shorter four letter word &ldquo;cute&rdquo; which is used about him from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not naive; no one has ever accused the Minister of being naive.  He has been accused of many things &mdash; some of them complimentary, some less so &mdash; but never of being naive.  He knows as well as anybody in this House, and better than most as Minister for Justice, that the intentions and reassurances of legislators are totally irrelevant so far as the interpretation of legislation by our courts is concerned.  He <Col N="2017" /> is fooling nobody with the rubbish he produced here today on that subject.</P>
      <P>Once again, as in 1983, he is storing up future problems and creating fresh uncertainties about the mother's right to life by putting forward a wording which is unnecessary to his stated intention of ruling out the suicide option and which is riddled with ambiguities which no amount of assurances as to the Government's intentions can resolve.</P>
      <P>I want now to deal with other specific points.  The words &ldquo;as distinct from the health of the mother&rdquo; have been described as offensive to women.  I do not think any man in this House is so lacking in imagination as to be incapable of imagining what he would feel if, as Deputy Shatter said, such a phrase were used about his health; but when it is women's health it is different.  I find it hard to understand that the women on the other benches can accept this.  The party whip is a powerful weapon&mdash;all of us are subjected to it.  All of us have gone along with it, with a lack of enthusiasm at times, on matters we were not happy with but they were not vital.  I find it surprising that women on the other side can go along with this particular insult and seek to enact it in constitutional legislation.</P>
      <P>His answer, his reassurances and his intentions on the use of these words are in the text.  I would like to read three successive sentences because I have been trying to understand their logic.  He states:</P>
      <P>There is no basis for such fears. Under the amendment women will continue to receive all necessary medical treatment to protect their health.</P>
      <P>That is one of the reassurances he gives without the slightest idea whether the wording he produces will have that effect.</P>
      <P>Current medical practice in this regard will not be affected.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether that is right, nor does he.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under current medical practice the question of termination of pregnancy <Col N="2018" /> only arises where there is a threat to the mother's life.</P>
    <P>How does he start this synergism with a proposition that under the amendment they continue to receive all necessary medical treatment to protect their health and when he comes to the third proposition of the synergism he can only have termination to protect her life.  I would ask Deputies to read those three sentences one after the other.  Try changing the order, put the third first and the first last and see what you get.  It is rubbish, it is absolute nonsense.  It is a contradiction in terms.  He does not know what he is talking about.  I do not know who wrote the speech but he does not seem to have read it before he came into this House.  As I say, he is a subtle man, he is not naive.  Had he read it carefully, or even semi-carefully, he would have, I think, reworded that in the interest of his own reputation.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that dropping the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;, would mean termination when there is no risk to life.  Let us try dropping the words and see what we get and see how he reached this conclusion.  If you omit the words you say &ldquo;It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother...&rdquo;  How does he reach the conclusion to drop the words that have the opposite meaning to those which even the Supreme Court will find they have?  I do not think the Supreme Court would find those words to mean anything but what they do.  The word &ldquo;save&rdquo; or &ldquo;protect&rdquo; is a problem but in terms of the issue being life, leaving out health, how does dropping the reference to health reintroduce health as an issue? How do the words &ldquo;save the life&rdquo; or &ldquo;protect the life&rdquo;&mdash; whichever word is better, and it is essential that one of those words be used &mdash;&ldquo;unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother&rdquo; introduce the possibility of a termination involving health?  Any Minister who puts propositions so directly contrary to their plain meaning to this House and expects in a constitutional <Col N="2019" /> amendment the House to accept it, is not naive but is trying to be too clever by half, which I am afraid is a particular disability this Minister has been known to suffer from since he came into politics.</P>

      <P>I am glad this is entertaining Deputies on both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>We know from the advice we have had &mdash; we sought it from the relevant people in medicine and law&mdash;and from what has been stated publicly by representatives of the medical profession that if those words are left in, doctors will be faced with the dilemma as to whether in a given case at the margin of life or health, they will find it more difficult to reach a clear decision. In those circumstances, some, undoubtedly, will feel they must play safe by the Constitution and the law given that the alternative is to commit an offence.  If it is unlawful it is not covered by the 1861 Act and the doctor goes to jail.  If these words are taken out doctors will be put in a position &mdash; and they have told us unambiguously &mdash; where they will find it more difficult to take decisions and some at least will feel an obligation in law not to take action in certain cases where the issue is marginal.  Surely that is not what this House wants.  It is not what the women in this House want.  It is not what the men on this side of the House want. Do the people on the other side really want that?  Can they have so little conscience, so little regard for the issue of the life of women as to go ahead with this in the face of what the medical profession have said?  I do not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in politics we all have to compromise.  I have compromised since I entered politics, that is something we all have to do.  You get overruled and outvoted and very often in Government &mdash;I must not say this because it is against the Constitution&mdash;I was outvoted, but I will not say on what.  I accepted that and went along with things.  There are some <Col N="2020" /> issues which go beyond that; there are some issues of conscience.</P>
    <P>I wish to recall for the House what happened when this matter arose.  As a result of the mistake I made in accepting the wording without adequate advice, I found myself at the end of January 1983 being advised by the then Attorney General that if we proceeded with the wording the lives of some women would be put at risk and there was also a possibility of abortion being introduced.  I faced my colleagues with this.  The Labour Party Ministers had formed a conscientious view on this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That says they were wiser than we were.  I admit that freely, and have always done so.  I called all the Fine Gael Ministers together to discuss the issue.  I can tell this House that, faced with the issue of conscience &mdash;that by proceeding with the wording, some woman's life might at some time be put at risk &mdash; every Fine Gael Minister agreed within 20 minutes that we must change the wording.  We knew we would probably be defeated, that the party would be split and that we would be humiliated and damaged politically, but given that some woman's life could be affected we felt we had no choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what happens ultimately when you are faced with a genuine moral issue in politics.  This is a genuine moral issue. Is there no one on the benches opposite who has the kind of concern which led us to take that action then regardless of the consequences?  Are the party opposite without anyone of conscience, anyone concerned about the issues I am raising, who would walk through the lobbies in defence of them?  What kind of a party are they?  At times in the past that party served the country well.  I have frequently made that case within my party and elsewhere. I find it hard to believe that it has got to the point where no one on the benches opposite is concerned about the issues of life and death with which we are dealing here, that the words do not matter and that ambiguity is unimportant.   <Col N="2021" /> It seems to have got to the stage where all that matters to them is that they should try to split the Progressive Democrats or Fine Gael so that they will fail, and that they should buy off the pro-life people.  Regardless of the cost, they want to avoid creating any problems for themselves such as disagreeing about the wording by bringing in legislation.  The important thing seems to be that they keep the party together.  Nothing else seems to matter; women's lives do not seem to matter.  I find this intolerable.  I do not like living in a country where even a party I am not a member of behave like that.  I find this intolerable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell further on that issue.  I feel strongly about it and I do not want to pursue it further.  Perhaps somebody opposite will have listened to what I have said.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to other issues.  None of us is without fault in this matter.  We are legislating here to export our problems. We are saying we will look after cases where the life of the mother is clearly and unambiguously at stake &mdash; as I said, we are trying to do this but not very effectively &mdash; but that if it is a question of a threat of suicide, rape or incest we will export those cases.  As a people we are concerned about these issues.  After all, we are here because of the X case.  What was our reaction to the X case?  What was the unanimous reaction of the country to that case?  People were horrified at that case because of the threat of suicide and the fact that the raped child was not being allowed to have an abortion.  It was the shock and horror of that case which has led us to where we are now.  What are we doing now?  We are saying &mdash; none of us is exempt from this &mdash; we will deal with the issue which was not really raised in that case, but the British can look after those cases involving suicide, rape or incest.  I do not think we are doing ourselves great credit by adopting that approach.  I understand and share the concern that if we act differently it will have a divisive effect on our society and we will be giving people who have already done damage to our society a field day.  I can understand why we do not want to <Col N="2022" /> face these issues.  I also understand that in not facing these issues there will be the other answer whereby people go to England until we get around to being sufficiently mature to deal with them ourselves. I can only say I am not very happy at what any of us are doing in regard to these matters.  I believe we all share a common concern in this regard.</P>
    <P>In cases where the actual issue of life is involved we have to stand firm, even if we are not prepared, to face up to the full implications of everything we are doing and not doing.  I appeal to the people opposite to look more seriously at what is involved.  They should not play party politics with this issue.  As we have shown in the past, this is not an issue for party politics.  They should show us that they can measure up to the kind of position we took on the issue.  They should show that they are not going to allow party advantage to be the determining factor when genuine issues of life and death are at stake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous and very eminent Members of this House, I cannot say I have looked into my heart to find out what the Irish people are thinking.  However, like many of my colleagues on all sides of the House I have tried to find out what is in the best interests of the Irish people, particularly women and children.  One must first look at how we have arrived at this position.</P>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by my colleague Deputy Garret FitzGerald on the events of 1983 and the very cynical attitude adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is clear that they deliberately exploited that situation in the hope of maximising their political advantage and used every possible ploy to ensure that the then Government were made to feel as embarrassed as possible at the situation which was developing.  They did absolutely nothing to ensure that there was a rational debate on the issues of concern to people at that time.  Rather they did everything possible to exploit the situation from local to national level, with obvious disastrous consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recall the profound <Col N="2023" /> wealth of knowledge and expertise offered to all parties on who was right and who was wrong.  We found ourselves in an extraordinary position at that time where two vehemently opposing sides were convinced that they were correct and capable of providing beyond any shadow of doubt that their interpretation of the wording was correct.  These people have all now been proven wrong.  Having regard to what happened in the past, I do not think anybody can be absolutely certain in this debate that they are right. That is the one lesson we should have learned from the debate which started in 1983 and which was revived during the X case.</P>
    <P>What are the public saying about this issue at present?  I accept that one should not necessarily go along with the populist view; one should have one's own opinions and try to impart one's knowledge and experience to the public in the hope of setting them on the right road. Nevertheless we have to listen to what the people are saying.  From what I have heard, the majority of people are opposed in principle to abortion.  I would go along with that view.  The majority of people are equally in favour of freedom of information and the right to travel, and I would certainly go along with those views.  Obviously there is a conflict in this area.  In view of the fact that the Government partly contributed to the confusion at an earlier stage, I believe it was their responsibility to remove some of the ambiguity in that area.  Unfortunately they have not done this: neither will they do it in the debate which will follow.  Because they have not tried to get rid of the ambiguity in this area over the past seven or eight years it is highly unlikely that they will change their views now.  The public can change their views. In the immediate aftermath of the X case people were very emotional.  One must always recognise that emotions are somewhat charged at times like that and that people on both sides will go further than they intended.  This is unfortunate.  I hope in these calmer times that the Government will take on board some of the <Col N="2024" /> points raised by my colleague, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, and other Members on this side of the House.  I hope they will keep in mind also some of the other comments by members of the public. Some of them are advocating that somehow politicians contrived this issue at present to deflect public attention from what they see as more serious issues.  In my view the issues involved are of equal importance.  Many people complain that there are other serious issues, such as that of unemployment, which have not received the same attention in this House, despite the fact that our unemployment level has reached alarming proportions. This is not my view but that of the people I meet on a daily basis.  They regularly make this point and did so quite forcefully to me at a function recently.</P>
    <P>The question of suicide was a very pivotal issue in the X case.  Suicide has been a very tragic and traumatic experience for many Irish families; over 1,200 people committed suicide in the past 12 months and that figure is rising.  I doubt any Member does not know of somebody who committed suicide.  I can think of many families in my constituency who experienced that trauma recently. Having consulted with families who have been affected by the trauma of suicide I have asked myself what can be done about this problem and what are the signs.  Usually the person concerned is suffering some stress or worried about something which they have not been able to resolve or discuss openly with another person in order to assuage their fears. That obviously causes problems.  There is no doubt that an unwanted pregnancy for a young girl could cause such distress. In years past that certainly was an issue that could not readily be discussed with parents or, indeed, with friends and we have had ample evidence to that effect. It is tragic that that should be the case.  I hope something has evolved from that period which will benefit the community at large.</P>
    <P>Who can decide when suicide is imminent? That is a very difficult and exacting task.  There are those in the medical profession who will say that a girl who indicates <Col N="2025" /> she is suicidal in the course of her pregnancy could very well end up committing suicide.  However, an equally eminent branch of the medical profession will disagree with that view.  Therefore, it is difficult for politicians to make a decision in that regard.  The prospect of a pregnancy of a particular type could cause such trauma to a girl or woman as to result in suicide.  Then we would be condemned.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the medical profession should be in a better position than most, from dealing directly with the patient concerned, to have a reasonably good idea as to the tendencies of the patient concerned.  There will also be situations where members of the medical profession will be able to say that they have attended patients over a period of time and never suspected that they were likely to commit suicide.  From my experience, the suicide rate among the male population is at least as high, if not higher, than among the female population. That is not an authoritative statement as I have no evidence to support it other than my own personal knowledge.</P>
    <P>In regard to the right to life and who should decide, the medical profession should be in the best position to advise a mother.  In so doing, their interest should be, first to the right of the mother and, second the right to life of the unborn baby.  In regard to the life &mdash; as distinct from the health &mdash; of the mother, at what stage does the health of the mother lead to a position whereby her life might be in danger?  At what stage can the medical profession, eminent though it may be, determine when the health of a person is such that it will deteriorate to a state where the life of that person is in danger? That is crucial and, unfortunately, it is not dealt with in the amendment before us but it was in contributions from this side.</P>
    <P>I put forward those views not as an expert and certainly not as a medical practitioner, but as one who has dealt with people, as has every Member, who have been traumatised at some stage in regard to this or similar issues.  Does the amendment provide for the rights of both <Col N="2026" /> the mother and the child?  I do not believe it does.  The amendment, by concentrating on the mother's life, seems to have forgotten about her health which could ultimately threaten her life.  That is a difficult issue.</P>
    <P>Nobody or no party should be labelled as abortionists.  I certainly am not and neither are my party and I make no apology for expressing my views in this regard. No pregnant woman or girl should have to worry that if something goes wrong during her pregnancy the Constitution might determine whether she lives or dies.  The same applies to an unborn baby. I do not understand why the Constitution should suddenly become involved in matters concerning a maternity hospital, a gynaecologist's waiting room or surgery. A consultant should be able to state that in his or her opinion the correct decision was made.  They should not have to ask themselves if they are telling the person what is right for them and for their child or what is right for them having regard to what is in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>We are then entering into an area where the State is becoming involved in what should really be the business of the professionals concerned. If we had not had the debate in 1983 I do not think we would have had the problem that arose from the X case.  If we had not had those divisive debates in 1983 we would not have had the equally divisive debate on the Maastricht Treaty, which had no bearing on the abortion issue, and the issue of the economic and monetary union became entangled in a debate of this nature.  Likewise, this debate should not transgress into the areas to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are my views and the views of many of my constituents who have told me that they are opposed to abortion but in favour of the freedom of information and the right to travel.  The issues of the right to travel and freedom of information have arisen as a result of a decision of the <Col N="2027" /> Supreme Court, following on a decision in the High Court, following on the famous debate of 1983.  If I could return to that debate for a moment.  I do not think that there was any eminent medical and legal expert who at that time did not put forward views which left many of us mere human beings floundering for words in regard to two matters.  First, the expert source from which these views emanated and, second, the profound wealth of knowledge with which they put forward their particular opinions.  What is sad about that is that they were all wrong.  We will now have a further debate on semantics which could be proven wrong in a couple of years time.</P>

      <P>That is the saddest part of all.  Again, I raise the question whether the State, or the Constitution in the form of the State, should lay down guidelines as to what should prevail in this situation. There are those who say it should.  There have been debates in the United States and throughout Europe over the past several years regarding abortion and freedom of choice.  I am a man and, therefore, am not in the best position to give an authoritative opinion.</P>

      <P>In all seriousness, it is worth noting that women generally, and the women to whom I have spoken throughout my constituency, feel strongly about this issue even though they are opposed to abortion and anything associated with abortion.  They do not want abortion at all but they feel resentment, and justifiably so, that the Constitution should say that, in this situation, the patient must now be judged by the medical profession and the practitioner must have due regard to what is laid down in law.  If there is an interruption of the pregnancy which does not have due regard to the constitutional requirements, the medical profession are at fault&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe we should introduce abortion so that we can boast to the international media that abortion is freely available here.  For some unknown <Col N="2029" /> reason we have taken it upon ourselves to include this qualification, and that includes the legal profession, a member of which was sitting across from me a few moments ago, the Supreme Court and the High Court.  Incidentally, this House was criticised with a certain amount of justification, for not legislating on this issue.  Legislation should have been in place so that everyone would know during the referendum what the position will be as a result of voting in a particular fashion.  The present position is that the people will vote in a referendum and if the Legislature is not satisfied with the outcome, it will legislate for what it sees as the failings of the people.  That is a very peculiar situation and one with which I have considerable reservations.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to become embroiled in an argument between the legal and political professions but I hope the debate continues in a rational manner. We must realise the importance of this issue to women who represent over 50 per cent of the population and I hope that when it comes to decision making the Government will have regard to the legitimate views and the deeply held convictions that have been expressed by Members on all sides of the House.  The Government might consider allowing the people to make their choice after the legislation has been laid before the House when they have had an opportunity to vet it.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to participate in this debate and to commend the Government's three Bills to the House and, indeed, to the Irish electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contents of these three Bills reflect several months of careful reflection and preparation by a Cabinet subcommittee. That subcommittee, in turn, drew on the <Col N="2030" /> knowledge and practical experience of a wide range of expert medical and legal opinion before formulating and finalising the proposals now before us.  These are proposals which I can fully endorse and support unequivocally, drawing on my own experience of the realities of life in Ireland as it is today.</P>
    <P>A number of persons, mainly it must be said, from outside of this House, have attacked the Government's proposals from mutually exclusive positions.  At one end of the spectrum, our proposals have been denounced as being excessively permissive, amounting in practice to an attack on the rights of the unborn. At the same time, our proposals have been derided with equal vehemence by those who wish to have abortion more freely available in this country.  Those of the latter view misrepresent the Government's proposals as a curtailment of women's rights, actual and potential.</P>

      <P>The sole point of consensus common to both extremes is to query the good intentions and basic credentials of Government speakers.  I have no hesitation in meeting either such challenge head on.  I am as much in touch with public opinion in Ireland as any other Deputy.  I say so because of my experience both as a private citizen and as a politician, drawing on my first hand knowledge and experience of the many facets of life in Ireland today, both urban and rural.  I was born in rural Ireland and drew some part of my formative experiences from there.  My political career is based in Dublin South, an urban constituency with a broadly representative spectrum of the electorate, young, old, affluent and disadvantaged alike.  Prior to becoming a full-time public representative, <Col N="2031" /> I was a teacher.  I am still in close touch with many of the pupils I taught &mdash; now young adults &mdash; as well as their parents.  I can draw on that wealth of practical experience in coming to debate here today and, in the weeks ahead, in the course of other public debates on this topic elsewhere.  It is certainly my intention, if I may borrow a phrase from Abraham Lincoln, to speak with malice towards none and with charity for all.  I hope other speakers will operate within the same parameters.</P>
      <P>The reputation of this Government in terms of the advancement of women in Irish society rests on demonstrable achievement, not just well meaning but unfulfilled aspirations.  I believe that considerable progress has been made by this Government in advancing the status of women in our society and I would refute any suggestion that the proposed Amendments go against this trend.  Since taking office in 1989, this Government have put in place comprehensive and effective structures to combat inequality. These structures include the explicit assignment of responsibility for the promotion of the position of Irish women to all Government Ministers, within their own areas of responsibility; my appointment as Minister of State for Women's Affairs, to complement the activities of all Government Ministers and all Government Departments, by exercising a monitoring and co-ordinating role on all aspects of Government policy as they affect women; the re-establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, a committee on which I had the honour to serve; and the establishment of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in November 1990, chaired by an eminent High Court Judge, Justice Mella Carroll, and including among its ranks the chairwoman of the Employment Equality Agency, Catherine McGuinness, an eminent lawyer in her own right.  It also includes both the chairwoman and chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women.</P>

Having regard to the very considerable expertise which is available within its membership, its imminent report is awaited with keen interest by all who care about the advancement of women in Irish society.</P>
      <P>I believe it would be helpful to this debate to remind the House of the types of substantive initiatives which have been taken by this Government since 1989 towards the achievement of gender equality. Some of these initiatives represent important gains for women, yet very often do not attract the level of media attention which they objectively deserve. The types of initiatives I have in mind are the enactment in December 1990 of new legislation on rape which introduces new offences with more severe penalties and abolishes the marital exemption in relation to rape; the Criminal Evidence Act which provides protection for the victims of violence in the home, by clearly establishing the circumstances in which the spouse of an accused is competent or compellable to give evidence; and the Criminal Justice Bill which provides for the judicial review of lenient sentences. This is a record of demonstrable achievement. It will, I trust, help to put the Government's good faith in relation to the three proposed Amendments into context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the proposed Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution it is worth emphasising, I believe, at form a mother's viewpoint it is an advancement on the position adopted in 1983, and enshrined in Article 40.3.3º.  That Article provided for the equal right of life of the unborn and the mother, but it <Col N="2033" /> was silent in legal terms on alleviating any threat to the life of the mother.  Article 40.3.3 remains but, for the first time, this proposed Amendment will ensure that, in all life threatening situations, there will not be any legal ambiguity to prevent an expectant mother from getting whatever medical and surgical treatment she needs.  It will have the very positive effect of clarifying the legal balance.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court decision in the X case affirmed the right of the mother to a medical termination of pregnancy where there would be a real and substantial risk to her life if the pregnancy continued.  It is important to recognise that the medical condition giving rise to the &ldquo;risk to life&rdquo; need not be absolutely immediate.  Medical decisions are taken on the basis of probability.  This Amendment will clarify the legal position for doctors and others involved in the medical care of women.  The enactment of the Twelfth Amendment will enable them to carry our essential treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed Twelfth Amendment is consistent with the Supreme Court decision, except for the exclusion of &ldquo;the risk of self-destruction&rdquo; provision.  I <Col N="2034" /> believe that the 1983 referendum demonstrated, clearly, the strongly held wishes of the majority of the Irish people against the widespread availability of abortion, as has been pointed out by Deputy Durkan.  It is still not desired nor is public opinion likely to change dramatically in the foreseeable future. Other countries, acting in good faith and motivated by compassion, have permitted the theat of suicide as a grounds for the legal termination of pregnancy. Experience has shown time and time again that such latitude leads to a high incidence of suicide threats and a correspondingly high level of legal abortions. That is clearly a scenario which the vast majority of people on this island, North and South, find morally repugnant and so reject.</P>
    <P>In line with the best legal advice available, the Government's proposed wording provides for a termination of a pregnancy to &ldquo;save the life, as distinct from the health&rdquo; of a mother.  While this may, at first reading, appear severe and an impossible distinction to define it is necessary, from a legal point of view if the Amendment is to stand on its own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will hear me out.  I am talking about the effect of the legal provision.  The language is taken directly from the Supreme Court judgement and those who favour the implementation of the Supreme Court judgement, in whole or in part, can scarcely object to the incorporation of that court's language.  The phrase &ldquo;as distinct from health&rdquo; must be seen in the overall context of the Twelfth Amendment.  That phrase must be coupled with the phrase &ldquo;giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life&rdquo;.  The latter phrase does not require, nor did the Supreme Court require, that the risk be immediate.  This, taken with the phrase &ldquo;necessary to save the life&rdquo; means that the pregnancy could be terminated if the best medical advice was that, even after childbirth and recovery of the mother therefrom, other treatments <Col N="2035" /> for whatever she was suffering from would be ineffective to save her life.</P>
      <P>I believe that these referenda must be approached in a calm, rational manner. In comparison with 1983 we are proceeding in a relatively calm and rational manner.  I know they are being so considered by many women.  Since my appointment as Minister of State for Women's Affairs, I have met and exchanged views with many concerned women on these issues.  My appointment in February coincided with the Supreme Court decision on the X case.  My European Affairs portfolio afforded me an opportunity to explore the implications of the Maastricht Treaty for Irish women in the context of that decision of the Supreme Court.  Those exchanges are fruitful and, I hope, mutually beneficial. These referenda are a fulfilment of the undertaking given at that time that these issues would be resolved, by referendum, prior to the coming into force of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>There have been calls for a postponement of these referenda, for time for further consultation but sufficient time has been afforded to permit debate.</P>

      <P>If some people had their way we would still be debating this in another ten years.  Some of the language in the debate on the abortion issue is very offensive to women and to many men. Many of the groups fail to take women's views fully into account and have no answer for some of the situations which <Col N="2036" /> may only rarely arise, where both the woman and the unborn child will die in the absence of life-saving medical treatment for the mother.  There is no medical consensus that such situations can never arise.  What I regret is that many so called pro-life campaigners will not admit in public what are the consequences of this position.  There is no room for extremism in this debate.  The Government amendment will afford protection to the mother by ensuring her entitlement to any treatment necessary to save her life.  It is pro-woman and reflects the views of the majority of the people who, I am certain, are not prepared to see their wives, sisters or mothers die for the sake of dogma.</P>
      <P>I support this proposed Twelfth Amendment and I make no apology to the zealots, lacking basic human compassion, who would stand back self-righteously and refuse medical intervention to a pregnant woman whose life is at risk.  Charity, surely, is the greatest of virtues?  Neither do I yield to those who see abortion on demand as an expression of social justice. Those who would sanction widescale abortion as a remedy or solution to women's problems are, in effect, attempting to make the unborn pay the price for injustices inflicted by others. That is contrary to social justice and an affront to the strongly held moral convictions of the vast majority of people in this country.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in relation to the right to travel is the least contentious of the three proposed Bills.  The positive consensus in this House towards the terms of this Amendment is a reflection of the reality that the right to travel is a basic human right which can and should be exercised freely by every citizen irrespective of class, creed or gender.  While the underlying thrust of this Bill may have merits evident to all of us, it is, nonetheless, essential for the Government to go on record to allay fears formented by some individuals and organisations outside of this House and to dispel any possible ambiguities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general consensus on the right to travel should not induce any complacency <Col N="2037" /> on our part.  Anything less than a wholehearted endorsement of that constitutional right will send out a very negative image of Ireland to the world.</P>
    <P>To attempt to curtail the rights of any sizeable number of our citizens to travel between this State and another would necessitate the creation of an extremely authoritarian regime &mdash; in essence, a police state.  No one can seriously suggest that we should attempt to curtail the right of Irish women to travel unless we wish to regress socially, economically and culturally to the unhappy level in which the people of Albania found themselves until relatively recently.</P>

      <P>The very small, unrepresentative but vociferous minority urging some curtailment of the right to travel have in mind in particular the right to travel of Irish women of child bearing age.  This is philosophically repugnant to me and, I am sure, to the entire House. Its anti-woman basis does not merit or require detailed rebuttal.</P>
      <P>We are here mandated in Dáil Éireann as legislators, acting for and on behalf of the electorate.  We have a duty and obligation to legislate in the best interest of all our people and for those reasons I commend this Amendment to the House.  It is an Amendment which bears out the good faith of the commitments which the Taoiseach and I gave in course of many meetings with women's groups during the course of the Maastricht referendum campaign.  The Thirteenth Amendment is positive proof that we have kept faith with those undertakings.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the Fourteenth Amendment which will enhance the right to information in our Constitution.  A right to information is a general principle enshrined in many written constitutions throughout the world.  That principle is also set down in general terms in the charters of various international agencies, including the United Nations and the Council of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2038" /> The right to information is a fundamental necessity in the fair administration of justice, in the process of facilitating freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association.  As long ago as 1948, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrined a right to &ldquo;seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As with all general principles, individual rights cannot be exercised in an unlimited way in a democratic society. Restrictions may and are sometimes necessary on various grounds, including public health and morals and protecting the rights and freedoms of others.  The wording which the Government are commending to the electorate by way of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment reflects the reality of that constraint.  The enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment will enable people who may contemplate an abortion abroad to make an informed choice with the help of non-directive counselling.</P>
    <P>Any serious analysis of the factors which bring women to have recourse to abortions must be wide ranging and comprehensive. The problem cannot be tackled unless the root causes are identified, analysed and dealt with in a logical, rational and determined manner.</P>

      <P>Access to objective, impartial information in relation to abortion is not simply exclusively a matter for pregnant women.  It is a matter which should and must concern their partners and their families.  The wider community, including voluntary and statutory organisations, must also take a more proactive role in counselling women who consider abortion as an option.  It is my sincere hope, a hope which is shared by all sides of this House, that access to non-directive counselling on the abortion question will actually help to reduce the incidence of abortion.  Society must make a concerted <Col N="2039" /> effort to alleviate or remove the various pressures which induce women to seek abortions.</P>
      <P>These three proposed Amendments were drawn up by the Government to meet the needs of Irish women as we near the end of the 20th century.  The Amendments have been drawn up with care and taking cognisance of the best legal and medical advice available. Anyone who proposes to dismiss them, either for short term political gain or because they care more for ideology than the alleviation of human suffering, has a moral obligation to produce a better alternative.  I doubt very much if any such better alternative will be forthcoming, now or in the near future.  I commend, therefore, these three Amendments to this House.</P>

      <P>As the first women speaker in this debate, for the information of the Minister of State for Women's Affairs, I would like to put on record the extensive degree of anger and resentment that is being felt by women outside this House because once again their needs and issues are to be manhandled in a most despicable way in this House and throughout this debate.  There is a great deal of anger not just among feminists but among women who perhaps in 1983, voted in favour of the Amendment. Women are angry because so much confusion has been created and there has been so much ambivalence by the Government on this issue.  The Minister will find that this will manifest itself in the very surprising vote against this proposed Amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing here is most regressive.  We are putting another constitutional policeman on women's lives. I know the political, legal and medical objectives of this exercise are represented as a measure to protect the foetus, or at least to protect it more than <Col N="2040" /> it is already protected in our laws and by our existing constitutional provisions. However, we are doing this in a society whose entire value structure and ethos is pro-life in the truest sense.  Broadly speaking, we celebrate and enjoy our children. We welcome new life into our families. We put a high premium on family support and family happiness and we have the highest ratio in developed countries of mothers who opt to stay at home and make sacrifices in terms of their own interests and their own professions to be closely involved in the care and rearing of their young children.</P>
    <P>There is no ambivalence on this.  No one wants, nor would promote nor work for the idea of easy abortion in this country. The notion is so far-fetched as to be ludicrous.  However, there are plenty of people who now realise that we must make provision for legal abortion in certain limited circumstances.  The issue of abortion is no longer a black and white issue.</P>
    <P>The campaign that follows this vote presumes that an &ldquo;abortion on demand&rdquo; regime is highly likely, in fact, is just around the corner if this Amendment is not passed.  To this end we will be intimidated, frightened, even threatened into voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to another insertion of irrelevant and simplistic words into our Constitution and most voters may not even know or understand what these words mean or how they might be interpreted by doctors, or, in the longer term, by the courts.  They are dangerous words and I sincerely hope that all sensible people, men and women, who care for the health and lives of their daughters, their sisters, their mothers, their wives will reject that.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that many people will realise that this debate is more about manipulation of the political process for Fianna Fáil Party gain than about reassuring women or securing their rights.  Personally I find aspects of this debate very unacceptable.  I believe nothing whatever will change in regard to our abortion statistics after our speeches here or after the campaign or after the vote.  All we will do is bring greater medical  <Col N="2041" /> uncertainty into the whole area of pregnancy and childbirth.  Our deliberations are negative in the extreme.  This debate is, more than anything else, about controlling women.  It is about restricting their powers.  It is about taking away their integrity and their right to make decisions about their lives.  At many points the debate is fuelled by threads of traditional misogynism, contributed to by people who regard women as &ldquo;less equal&rdquo; than men, undeserving of equal rights.  These people cannot change their idea of women as objects and breeding machines that can be manipulated and controlled through law, practice and custom.</P>
    <P>This debate is masquerading as a solemn attempt to restrict abortion in Ireland and it is being railroaded through by a party that is showing itself to be totally insensitive to the views of women, to their organisations, to the doctors who have serious reservations about the likely outcome of the proposals.  I regret that what is happening now is a direct replay of the Fianna Fáil role in the referendum of 1983 when, under the leadership of Deputy Charles J. Haughey, that party aligned themselves, with the full and active support of many of the people still sitting opposite, with narrowminded, fundamentalist groups like SPUC, PLAC and the Knights of Columbanus.  They took the high moral ground and collaborated in bullying the electorate into a most inappropriate and misguided vote. All chance of reasonable argument was sacrificed to intense emotion and bitter division during the entire campaign.  The reasonable proposals for alternative wording put forward by Dr. Garret FitzGerald, the former Taoiseach, and Mr. Peter Sutherland, the Attorney General, were rejected.  They warned that the Fianna Fáil proposal would lead to Supreme Court challenges.  They warned that it would restrict freedom of travel and they warned that it would inevitably lead to legalisation of abortion here.  We have lived to see this happen.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the whole country lived through the awful trauma of the High Court and Supreme Court cases involving a young pregnant girl.  The vast <Col N="2042" /> majority of people opposed what was happening to her and her family.  It was only when we saw how this girl was trapped in this country by an injunction of the High Court, coping with a pregnancy that was life-threatening, her family powerless to help her, that we realised the full extent of the inadequacy of Article 40.3.3º. of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>If the so-called X case and the varying interpretations of the 1983 amendment have shown us one thing with clarity it must surely be the impossibility of reducing to a sentence or two a concept of such complexity and variability that it will be different in every set of human circumstances in which it arises.  This is a matter which should have no place in the Constitution.  It requires a detailed and graduated framework which can only be provided in legislation.</P>
    <P>At this point I would appeal to the Government to change course, to put whatever differences exist between us in this House behind us and make the right decision now, that is, to introduce legislation first and let people know exactly what they will be voting for and the likely implications of their vote.  How can Members of this House once again turn their backs on the criticism levelled at us by the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy for our failure to give legislative effect to the 1983 amendment?  Perhaps one can understand to some extent why this House never went back to necessary legislation which was left in abeyance after the 1983 amendment.  We were, perhaps, paralysed into inaction by the dreadful hostility, the dreadful bitterness, the dreadful division which we ourselves created through our divisive approach to the 1983 amendment.  It was very unpopular to question the lack of legislation and people just stayed away from it.  It was as if people were afraid they would get burnt.  We now see the havoc wreaked as a result of that.  It was the wrong approach.</P>
    <P>In the last few weeks I have listened to many consultants and gynaecologists and have heard their real concerns and confusion. Unlike 1983, on this occasion we have had the benefit of the considered <Col N="2043" /> views of many eminent consultants.  I would like here to commend Dr. Mary Henry for her responsible and clear enunciation of issues on the media in recent weeks.  There are many more doctors who feel equaly strongly but who, for reasons of their employment conditions or fear of public hassle, are unable to speak out.  Many of them have made their views known privately to the Taoiseach. One such group of 12 eminent consultants contacted me privately to express their very real fears and their opposition to what is happening.  Surely these fears must be recognised and cannot be dismissed.</P>
    <P>One man from the Opposition benches, Deputy McDaid, has publicly expressed his reservations despite his party's opposite policy and despite considerable local vilification of himself.  In an <i>Irish Times</i> article he wrote:</P>
    <P>Until it can be proven otherwise, I am firmly of the opinion that rare cases can occur where the prolonging of a pregnancy puts the life of the mother very seriously at risk.  These would include such conditions as serious cardiac disease, congenital and otherwise, and cancers in which metastasis is greatly intensified by pregnancy.  Early termination of pregnancy seems to me to be indicated in such cases and should, I believe, be done here.</P>
    <P>In the same article Deputy McDaid said:</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that if even one case should occur every ten years where the life of the mother can only be saved by a termination of pregnancy then a total constitutional ban would be very wrong indeed.  Such a ban could only be justified in my view if medical science were advanced to the stage where we could guarantee that no woman's life would ever be seriously threatened by pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I want all doctors dealing with pregnant women to be confident and sure that they will be able to freely diagnose according to the total needs and interests of that <Col N="2044" /> woman's life and health.  Women are entitled to know that the doctor carrying for them, with their best interests at heart, will be free from constraints under Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.  What we do here must be clear and specific; we must not contribute to a sense of suspicion and mistrust within the medical world and to an atmosphere in which self-appointed moral guardians in hospitals could indirectly influence a woman's treatment in a way which is inconsistent with what her medical doctor recommends and wants.</P>
    <P>Let me quote an instance which is allied but not directly concerned with this subject.  Such a thing happened in a Dublin hospital in 1985 when I was hospitalised for a hysterectomy operation. A woman patient came into my room to tell me about her experience. She, too, had been admitted for such an operation having had severe bleeding for many months.  She was 35 years old and had four young children.  Both herself and her husband, along with her consultant had fully discussed and accepted the need for her operation.  Despite that fact when that woman was under the anaesthetic in the operating theatre a theatre nurse intervened and challenged the surgeon saying that this woman was still of child bearing age and as far as she, the nurse, was concerned her symptoms did not warrant radical surgery.  At that time the surgeon was in no position to argue in the tense environment of an operating theatre.  He could not assert his right over his patient and so the operation never took place.  The woman was brought back to her bed without having the operation that she so badly needed carried out and told me that she was in the process of making plans with her surgeon to transfer to another hospital so that this necessary operation could be carried out.</P>
    <P>I should say that I found this to be intolerable interference by a third party in a decision that was taken privately between doctor and patient but I wonder whether this was an isolated incident or can this type of action still happen in our hospitals perhaps indeed with conditions <Col N="2045" /> of a more serious nature than a hysterectomy needing treatment.</P>
    <P>I could perhaps put the matter in context if I propose in an exaggerated way to the men present in the House that they should reflect for a while on how they would feel if such a thing were to happen to them while on their backs in the operating theatre waiting for an operation for testicular cancer or some such operation and a third party in the operating theatre said that the operation could not take place because they were still capable of having children.  I accept that I am exaggerating and that one cannot have a direct parallel but I ask them to think about this question where a woman is in an operating theatre having made her decision and believes that an operation is going to be carried out and someone else intervenes.  Indeed, it says something about the system that a third party can have the confidence to intervene.</P>
    <P>Similar arguments apply regarding the issue of women and suicide.  This should be a matter between a woman and her medical adviser and I reject the notion that a threat of suicide from pregnant women could or should be regarded as a frivolous threat and excluded from the amendment.  I fail to understand the basis for this decision and find it both cruel and insensitive.</P>
    <P>Would the Government accept that their thesis will disintegrate, morally and ethically, when the first pregnant woman or girl does commit suicide?  I do not want to examine my conscience if that happens because of a decision taken in this House. What I would like to know is what consultation did the Government have on this issue before arriving at this wording. We are entitled to know the answer.</P>
    <P>Did they examine the considered views of psychiatrist Dr. Anthony Clare as quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 17 October?  These have been quoted by other speakers.  He said that the Government decision failed to take account of the mental state of a minority of women who were particularly at risk because they might be under age or victims of rape or violent abuse.  He further rejected accusations that taking account of the <Col N="2046" /> suicide risk would lead to an open door abortion policy and suggested that risk could be strictly interpreted in line with the cultural and ethical views of the country but that the Government's position seemed to be that psychological ill-health and suicide were out of the question as grounds for abortion and that to even consider such things in a professional and skilled way was impossible.  He further said that the thin edge of the wedge argument had been widely used and accepted as if trained psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers were not to be trusted to judge someone in a precarious suicide state who was pregnant.  It appears that, like most doctors, psychiatrists and psychologists, women are not to be trusted to make decisions about themselves.</P>
    <P>In the same article Dr. Clare said that in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment he and a medical colleague carried out a study of literature on suicide and pregnancy.  They had established that the risk of suicide was lower in pregnant than non-pregnant women but it was not the majority they were concerned with but the minority of women who were particularly at risk and that the most recent review showed that the rate of suicide was higher among pregnant teenagers than in other age groups.</P>
    <P>Let me turn for a few moments to deal with the other proposed amendments. The amendment dealing with the right to information is generally welcomed but I would add the proviso that the conditions to be laid down in law to give effect to it must be made known in advance and should have been made known prior to this week.  I am uncertain as to the reason we need conditions surrounding the right of women to information about a very important and intimate issue.  We need to know how restrictive this information is going to be and the reason it is restrictive. We also need to know if it will be broadly spread as outlined by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, on Olivia O'Leary's programme on RTE recently.  According to the Minister that night, there would be no censorship of magazines or newspapers and that facts and information would be readily and <Col N="2047" /> easily available.  I am sure most people would agree that this is perfectly satisfactory but we need to have express information about that matter before we vote on this issue.</P>
    <P>Finally, let us consider the reality of our abortion problem.  We have to accept frankly and honestly that, despite the constitutional ban, the information blackout and considerable hostility, these figures are rising every year.  The fact that the abortions in question are carried out in England does not change the equation. Given our present approach we are effectively denying the great difficulties of these women and banishing them to find their solutions in other countries instead of trying to understand the circumstances which forced them to have foreign abortions, every one of which is a terrible human tragedy.  We need to know the conditions surrounding the departure of every women who makes her decision such as her attitude to contraception, her financial and social needs, her relationship with the father of her child, who it was who helped her make her decision, who her advocates were, what counselling she received before and after the abortion, if any.  I am aware that the Department of Health consider that they have no role to play in regard to these women, who do not even exist as recorded statistics.  This has to change because unless we know the circumstances surrounding these women's lives we cannot begin to help them and reduce the number of abortions.</P>
    <P>There are many things we need to do and these have been outlined already by other speakers from this side of the House.  We need to help the women concerned with their exported social problems and reduce the number of people who have to go to England for abortions. We also need to introduce proper sex education in schools with a special focus on boys and young men to instil in them the need to adopt a responsible approach to sexual activity and parenthood.</P>
    <P>There should be a contraceptive advice service, aimed specifically at young men and women, as well as a pregnancy counselling <Col N="2048" /> programme.  I deeply regret that the Minister in his speech today did not deal with these issues.  He gave no indication of the practical action the Government might take on contraception, research and counselling.  That is an indication that once the referendum is over women will once again be left high and dry and nothing more will be done.</P>
    <P>The reason we need proper research programmes &mdash; I would stress this &mdash; is that most of the research that is available deals with abortions in America and the UK where totally different structures exist.  Such research cannot be used here to measure the psychological distress of women before and after abortion.  We need follow-up studies as well as examining all the factors which contribute to the decision to abort.  In this context I would refer to the briefing document which all of us received from the Psychological Society of Ireland which indicates the need for research and the fact that we have to find out information on many matters that have been already examined and analysed in other countries about the women in question.  I recommend this very useful briefing document.  As someone who has worked for 25 years in all areas of reform for women I passionately reject this amendment and I will be asking voters to do the same.</P>

      <P>It is worrying, although not amazing, that even before the debate on the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution Bills had started in this House the public at large were already fed up with the issue.  Almost everybody I have met in the past few days said that they switch off the radio and television when the subject is being discussed.  The reason for this is clear: the public are confused. They are disillusioned with the manner in which this most fundamental and serious issue of the right to life is being hastily <Col N="2049" /> introduced and passed through the Dáil. The extent of the confusion, misapprehension and misunderstanding that exists among the people should surely be a warning signal to the Government that it is vital at this stage to have an adequate, proper and detailed debate in this House in an attempt to clarify the enormous clouds of fear and the questions that have arisen.  Had the Government properly understood what they were about to impose on the people it would at least have helped to avoid the misunderstanding that now exists.  It is blatantly clear that not even all the members of the Government have the same understanding of the proposed wording to deal with the substantive issue of abortion. This is totally inexcusable and is the reason the public are clueless as to what is the precise meaning of the amendments that will be put to them on 3 December.</P>
      <P>Now that the Government have created the confusion &mdash; they alone have caused it &mdash; surely it is reasonable, if not logical, to conclude that the only means whereby some degree of clarification can be provided is by allowing a very detailed and lengthy debate in this House on the issue.  The Government's approach to this important issue is disappointing if not unacceptable.  Having created such confusion they are now compounding their mistake with a blatant and dangerous kind of dictatorship, ignoring the genuine and sincere concerns of all the Opposition Parties.  The outcome of the Government's actions will be that the people of Ireland will be forced to vote on a wording that has not been clarified and in relation to which they have been given no reasonable chance to discover its precise meaning.  This is grossly offensive; it is unfair and unjust.  To ask the people to vote in the dark is the same as giving them no vote at all.</P>
      <P>The real questions that must be answered are: why does the referendum have to be held on 3 December and why is it more important to the Taoiseach to get the issue out of the way rather than to get it right?</P>

Most of all, why are the lives of women and the unborn not worthy of a full serious discussion to avoid the dilemmas of the recent past?

      <P>No human right is more fundamental or important than the right to life.  Fine Gael as a party are and always have been opposed to abortion.  It is interesting that during the debate this afternoon the Minister, Deputy Flynn, stated that there are some who support abortion on demand and no consensus could be achieved with them.  To whom is the Minister referring?  He is obviously referring to somebody in the House.  Is he referring, perhaps, to some of his own backbenchers?  I demand that he clarify this matter.  He must know to whom he is referring, otherwise why would he make such a statement?  That kind of dangerous statement must not be left unqualified and the Minister should ascribe it to those to whom he believes it applies.</P>
      <P>I respect the sincere and compassionate attitude of my colleague, Deputy Nuala Fennell, to the question of whether suicide should remain as an issue in determining whether abortion should be allowed.</P>

      <P>I respect her views on this issue.  However, I would personally find it extremely difficult to believe that it is possible to administer a law or a constitutional provision which would provide for those cases as outlined without the fear of abuse.  The complexities of the issue are outlined by the varying views held within the parties, but that <Col N="2051" /> does not lessen the degree of compassion and understanding I have for those cases.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believe that the substantive issue of abortion cannot be justly or correctly addressed without legislation.  The six mark question is, and we have not been able to get an answer to it, why is the Taoiseach so reluctant or indeed downright opposed to legislation on this issue?  Is it because he fears he cannot bring his own backbenchers with him through the process?  The request by Fine Gael for legislation is a reasonable, logical and balanced one.  Our objective is to ensure detailed explanations on the meaning of the proposed amendments. It is basically irresponsible to knowingly and willingly leave in the hands of the medical and legal professions the duty to interpret the amendment without any attempt by the legislators to clarify by legislation the interpretation of the proposed wording.</P>
      <P>The overwhelming majority of the people on this island do not want to see abortion available generally here.  We had hoped that the Taoiseach would deal with this difficult social issue in a very honest and open way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <P>However, his performance to date clearly shows that this is not to be.  The reality is that so difficult and complex is the issue of abortion that it cannot be dealt with by the insertion of a new sentences in the Constitution. One attempt has failed, sadly we cannot hope that the present attempt will be other than a failure also.  It is astonishing that the Government do not propose to publish any legislation, particularly as the advice of the Attorney General was to provide legislation.  Fine Gael believe that prior to a referendum being held on the substantive issue detailed legislation addressing the difficulties involved should have been brought before the House for discussion by the Government. I would ask, why a different approach is being taken on this issue from the approach that will be adopted on the <Col N="2052" /> issue of divorce?  There is no justificable reason for proceeding in the manner as outlined by the Government.</P>
      <P>Finally, as I pointed out earlier, there is considerable conflict among Government Ministers as to the meaning and the intent of the proposed amendment.  It has caused alarm among the medical profession and concern to many women throughout the country.  It is alarming that even at this early stage of the debate such conflict and confusion is evident. The lives of women and of the unborn should not be subjects for political gains.</P>
      <P>The problem of abortion should be recognised for its complexities; simplistic constitutional solutions have never been, and never will be, the answer.  Tragically, the Government, by refusing to provide comprehensive legislation, are abdicating their constitutional duty.  We must avoid, as far as possible, the options which so many have to choose, the option of abortion.  In those cases there is an urgent need to provide better support, advice services, information on the choices and options available to women, counselling and care.</P>
      <P>Adoption should be encouraged and people should be informed of that option. After all, 10 per cent of couples are infertile. Who will speak for them?  Why not devote time and resources towards providing the back-up support which would limit the numbers opting for abortion? This would be a positive response to a sad and serious problem.</P>
      <P>It is unwise and reckless for the Government to push these Bills through the House with unnecessary haste.  They will regret their outrageous, impetuous decision but, sadly, in the meantime I hope no one will suffer as a result of their actions.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to understand why the Government should reject the advice of people whose business it is to deal with this matter.

      <P>The Government are shying away from their responsibilities, which is to solve the problem of unemployment and lack of jobs.  They are very lucky in being able to distract the people from our true situation.  We are living in cloud cuckoo-land by asking the people to decide on this issue.  I know it is a vital issue to the well-being of our community but it overshadows the real issue of unemployment. I wish to remind the Ministers of State &mdash; and the Minister for Health &mdash; that the situation in Ireland is as serious as it is in Great Britain.  We are told that the recession there has deepened to a depression.  God knows there will be a major depression in this country after 3 December because everybody knows that the issue being put before the people is a smokescreen for <Col N="2054" /> the more serious problems affecting our economy.  It is difficult to understand why the Government have embarked on this course.  Each section in the Amendment is meant to approve of abortion, one way or the other.  Let nobody think differently. The Government are wolves in sheeps' clothing.</P>
      <P>All abortions should be rejected by the people.  Why did the Government not have the courage to put before the people a formula which required a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  Why will three ballot papers be required?</P>

      <P>I know three different issues are involved but there was a right to travel and information long before I was a Member of this House and it will be there after me.  The Government are merely clouding the issue.  The question of abortion should be buried once and for all to ensure that it will never again raise its ugly head in the Dáil or in the country.  As I said, the electorate do not have a choice.  I wonder if the Taoiseach will have a mandate from the Dáil to introduce legislation when the electorate reject the amendment.  Many Deputies across the House will have the courage of their convictions to speak up for the people whom they represent and they will make sure that he does not put through legislation which will lead to abortion being made available.  There are many men and women in the Government parties who will ensure that abortion will never be tolerated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael are unanimous on this issue.  There is no record of any woman in this country losing her life for lack of medical attention while <Col N="2055" /> expecting a child.  Expectant mothers were treated by the medical profession without consulting anyone.  If there is a right to life in the womb the mother also has a right to life.  This medical procedure was practised down through the years and it was practised very well.  I recognise no reason that we should now go back and make abortion in this country legal, even on a limited basis.  As I have said, this issue has clouded more important issues confronting the country.  It has kept people's minds off the major issues.</P>
      <P>I should like to share with the House a quotation relating to the 1861 legislation. Treatments were lawful under the 1861 Act even when their indirect result was the loss of an unborn child, since that Act forbids only action taken with intent to procure a miscarriage.  The established medical practice of more than a century has always allowed mothers to be fully and properly cared for during pregnancy. It is important to realise that a mother may not be denied treatment because of possible but undesired and unintended consequences for her baby, even in some cases resulting in death.  Treatments intended to protect the life of the mother and not involving any direct attack on her unborn child have always been ethically and lawfully proper, even though the loss of a child may follow as an unsought and unwelcome side effect. That statement clearly outlines the powers that exist under the present administration.  I really think that the issues now put before the people will cloud their minds to such an extent that they will not even go out to vote, and I have heard decent, responsible electors in my constituency say that they will not exercise their vote in the referenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose for the main part of my contribution to this important debate to address the proposed Twelfth and Fourteenth Amendments, that is, those on the substantive issue and on freedom of information.</P>
      <P>In 1983 Article 40.3.3º amended the Constitution to state that:</P>
      <P>the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the X case earlier this year the Supreme Court decided that under the wording of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, an abortion is permissible if there exists a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother.  They also accepted that such a real and substantial risk existed in the case before them because of the threat by the pregnant woman to commit suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Cabinet subcommittee set up to deal with the implications of this decision, I have had the opportunity, with my colleagues, to examine very carefully all the options open to the Government, taking account of very extensive legal and medical advice.  I believe, for the reasons which I will now outline, that the proposed wording for the Twelfth Amendment represents the best and most balanced solution to a very complex set of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's intention in relation to the Twelfth Amendment, that is, the amendment on the substantive <Col N="2057" /> issue itself, can be expressed very simply: it is to protect the right to life of the unborn child subject only to ensuring that a doctor may carry out whatever treatment is necessary to resolve a life-threatening medical condition of the mother.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, maternal deaths are now very infrequent in developed countries. In Ireland there are, on average two to three known maternal deaths per annum. This figure, related to the number of births, compares favourably with the rates in the UK and the US and the majority of our EC partners, and reflects a very good ante-natal care and obstetric service.  Nonetheless, there are medical conditions which have the potential to cause a risk to the life of the mother during pregnancy.  These can be divided into three categories.  First, certain conditions are directly associated with the pregnancy itself.  These include haemorrhage, toxaemia, pulmonary embolus and infection.  In most cases it is possible to treat the condition without losing the foetus.  However, another condition in this category, ectopic pregnancy, is potentially a very serious situation which may be fatal for the mother unless there is prompt surgical intervention.  The second category includes life-threatening conditions which are not related to the pregnancy but which may be exacerbated by it.  These include cardiac disease, hypertension and kidney failure.  Deputies will be aware that medical opinion is divided as to whether circumstances can arise in which the termination of the pregnancy would be the only effective option to save the mother's life.  The third category includes certain other medical conditions which cannot be treated without causing or risking the loss of the foetus.  Examples of such conditions include cancer of the womb, breast cancer and brain tumours.</P>
    <P>Much of the public debate in this whole area has revolved around drawing a distinction between types of life-saving treatment of the mother.  As a doctor and as a legislator, I believe very strongly that any treatment which is necessary to save the mother's life must be seen as having that objective as its definitive intent.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, the term <Col N="2058" /> direct abortion has no relevance to a situation in which a doctor sets out to treat a life-threatening medical condition in an expectant mother.  To me, the concept of direct abortion is relevant only when an abortion is carried out for other reasons, so that the primary intent is to end the pregnancy rather than to save the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>The problem with using the term &ldquo;direct abortion&rdquo; in the way that it has been used by some groups can be particularly well illustrated by looking at ectopic pregnancy.  There are two possible approaches to the treatment of this condition, both of which result in the loss of the foetus.  The first involves the removal of the fallopian tube, with the foetus.  The second involves removal of the foetus alone, so that the fallopian tube is preserved and the woman has a better change of becoming pregnant again in the future.</P>
    <P>To make a distinction between direct and indirect terminations implies that the first treatment, which involves removing the tube, is acceptable because the loss of the foetus is in some way a side-effect whereas the second treatment is not acceptable.  I am afraid that the logic of this argument escapes me completely. The need for treatment arises only because of the location of the foetus, and the sole purpose of the treatment is to remove the foetus in order to save the woman's life.  We can then go to ask how it could possibly be considered less acceptable to achieve the same end, where this is medically possible, without having to remove the fallopian tube, so that the mother has a better chance of conceiving again, given that under either form of treatment the foetus is lost.</P>
    <P>Let us now consider a different type of medical crisis &mdash; an expectant mother suffering from rheumatic heart disease who is at risk of cardiac failure during pregnancy.  It is of course the case that medical opinion differs as to whether it will arise in practice that a woman's life may be lost through heart failure where the termination of her pregnancy would have averted this.  Deputies will have heard expert opinions on either side.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> There are few black-and-white certainties in medicine, and it is very difficult to assert categorically that such a situation could never arise in an individual case.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that, in an individual case, the expert medical opinion is that, on the balance of probability, the continuation of the pregnancy will pose a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman.  Her doctors will, of course, have considered every possible alternative option.  If it is the case that none of the alternatives can save her life, her doctors may consider, in consultation with the patient herself, the possibility of termination of the pregnancy in order to save her life.  In my view, such a decision would have to be made on the same basis as that in the case of the ectopic pregnancy &mdash; the objective and intent of the treatment is to save the life of the woman.</P>
    <P>The examples I have quoted show the dangers in trying to frame an amendment based on terminology such as &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; termination in a situation where the life of the mother is at serious risk.</P>
    <P>I would like to put a question to those opponents of the proposed amendment who have argued that the wording should be more restrictive.  The question is: if an individual patient suffering from a heart condition can only be saved by means of a termination of her pregnancy, is it their preference that she be left to die?  As far as I can see, the only response so far to such questions is to deny that such a possibility could arise.  I can only describe this as avoiding the question.  It cannot be stated that such a situation could never arise, because expert medical opinion cannot agree that this is so.</P>
    <P>I believe that the vast majority of the Irish people would be appalled at the suggestion that a woman in such a situation should be left to die, and that they would wish to see her receive whatever treatment was necessary.  The Government's wording is designed to ensure that, if it should ever be necessary in an individual case, the medical profession <Col N="2060" /> has at its disposal whatever means are necessary to save the life of the woman.</P>
    <P>I must reiterate that it is my view, and the view of the Government, that it is wholly inappropriate to use the term &ldquo;direct abortion&rdquo; in the context of such treatments.  Indeed, I would imagine that any woman who was unfortunate enough to have to suffer the loss of her expected child, as well as having to battle with a life-threatening illness, would be deeply hurt by the callous and unfeeling use of such terminology by those who should know better.</P>
    <P>There has, of course, been criticism of the wording also from those who feel that it is too restrictive, and it has been suggested that it could in some way weaken the protection available to the life of the mother under existing medical practice.  Much of this criticism has focused on the phrase &ldquo;life, as distinct from health&rdquo;.  It has been suggested, for example, that the wording would only permit a termination of pregnancy where the risk to the life of the mother was either immediate or certain.  Neither of these interpretations is correct.</P>
    <P>The Government have been advised that the wording does not require the risk to be immediate.  If the doctors believe that unless the necessary treatment is given now, there will be no other effective way of saving the mother's life at a later stage, they may proceed with the treatment even though the death of the foetus may result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to certainty, normal medical practice can only operate on the basis of probability &mdash; there are no certainties.  The Supreme Court's test referred to the establishment, as a matter of probability, of the real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, and the proposed wording is consistent with this. It follows therefore that all current medical practice in this country will continue to be permitted under the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government gave very careful consideration to the suggestions that the <Col N="2061" /> phrase &ldquo;as distinct from health&rdquo; should be omitted.  Unfortunately, the inclusion of this phrase seems necessary to avoid a possible future interpretation that health unrelated to a life-threatening condition was a ground for abortion.  The Government believe that such an outcome, which has in other jurisdictions led effectively to abortion on demand, would be entirely unacceptable to the Irish people, and the possibility of it occurring should not be left open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed amendment follows exactly on the interpretation of the Supreme Court except in so far as threatened suicide will not be a ground for the termination of pregnancy. The decision to exclude suicide was not an easy one and was only taken by the Government after thorough and exhaustive examination of the research which was available on the relationship between suicide and pregnancy.</P>
      <P>The international literature concerning suicide and pregnancy is very complex and needs very careful and objective analysis.  However, some important conclusions can be drawn.  One is that suicide in pregnancy is extremely rare.  Indeed, for the majority of women pregnancy seems to be good for their psychological health and may indeed protect against suicide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is exemplified in much of the literature I read during the summer.  A second important finding is that the psychiatrist's task in assessing the risk of suicide is beset by serious theoretical and practical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is when we take these two findings together that the dilemma which faced the Government comes into focus.  If it is the case that suicide in pregnancy is extremely rare, but if it is very difficult to predict accurately in an individual case, accepting suicidal tendencies as a ground <Col N="2062" /> for a termination would be likely to lead to the certain loss of many unborn children, without any certainty that even one suicide had been averted.</P>
    <P>Without exception the experience in other countries has been that the inclusion of mental health grounds such as risk of suicide has effectively resulted in abortion being made available on demand.</P>
    <P>The Government accept that unwanted pregnancy can lead to emotional and psychological trauma and that a caring society must be able to respond to this.  However, in balancing all the rights and wrongs involved in this very complex issue we should learn from the mistakes made in other countries and recognise that abortion is not the answer.  The answer lies in how as a Government we take care of women with unplanned pregnancies and how as a society we respond and care for these women.</P>

      <P>The exclusion of suicide as a grounds for abortion has been presented by many both inside and outside the House as a failure on the Government's part to respond to the needs of women in Ireland today.  I would like to take this opportunity to say nothing could be further from the truth.  A wide range of help and assistance is available for women for whom an unplanned pregnancy may result in psychological problems. I am thinking here not only of the support services provided in each health board area by multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, community psychiatric nurses and social workers but also the wide range of support and counselling services provided by voluntary agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people decide not to adopt the Twelfth Amendment, the Supreme Court interpretation of Article 40.3.3º will stand.  The Government have decided that in that case it will be necessary to introduce legislation to regulate the position, so as to minimise the possibility <Col N="2063" /> that the wider grounds set out in that interpretation would lead to unjustified terminations of pregnancy.</P>

      <P>I am at present working on a summary of what this legislation would have to contain.  I must, however, make it very clear that I would regard the introduction of such legislation, instead of the adoption of the proposed constitutional amendment, as a far less desirable outcome.  For all the reasons I have outlined earlier, it is far preferable to remove threatened suicide from the grounds for legal terminations, and I urge everyone both in this House and in our society to appreciate the importance of so doing.</P>
      <P>The complexities of the issues raised in this debate have implications not only for individual Members of the House and for the general public, but also for the medical profession.  It is quite clear that medical care and the provision of that care at the margins for women when life is at risk should remain at the forefront of debate.</P>
      <P>It is the medical profession who are called upon to deal with issues of life and death, with the complex legal and treatment considerations of patients under their care.  It is individual doctors who will be at the forefront of the decision-making process implicit in the issues raised by the referendum on the substantive issue.  It is not the referendum itself that brings this about, it is a fact of medical life.</P>
      <P>Every day, the medical profession provide expert medical and surgical care for pregnant women regardless of the medical complexities, rarity of diagnoses or the trauma that may arise in exceptional individual cases.  It is necessary to reassure people generally and women in particular that that caring and expert treatment will remain fully available in our health services regardless of the outcome of the referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be stressed that such treatment and care has been the hallmark of <Col N="2064" /> our health services for many years.  It should be clearly acknowledged that the medical profession are obviously to the fore in deciding on matters that are the essence of life or death.  That reliance on the profession has been well placed as evidenced by the high national and international reputation of our obstetric and gynaecological services in particular. This faith is clearly shared by the general public and must be safeguarded at all costs during the referenda debate.  This will be a major element of my contribution as Minister for Health to the debate both in this House and outside.</P>
    <P>The medical profession either as individual doctors or within their representative or professional organisations will assess the implications of the referenda, particularly those on information and especially the substantive issue.  I have no doubt that the profession will look to the Medical Council to give them guidance in matters of ethical conduct and behaviour.  This is as it should be as they have the statutory function to so advise.  It will be the case that the current code of ethics of the council will require scrutiny in the light of the outcome of the referenda.  Whether this scrutiny will result in changes is, of course, a matter for the Medical Council in the full knowledge of the legal situation which will pertain at the time.</P>
    <P>The fundamental principles will remain that a doctor must do his best to preserve life and promote the health of the sick in accordance within the existing legal framework.  I am aware that there is some concern among individual members of the profession at the implications of the referenda if approved by the people and the implications in relation to the current practice of medicine.  It is important that given the pivotal role of the profession in the treatment and management of cases that any concerns of the profession generally in relation to the issues raised be addressed properly and adequately.  If those concerns warrant it, I am fully available to the representative organisations to tease out the issues in so far as their members are concerned and offer whatever assistance is appropriate <Col N="2065" /> in the best interests of the profession and of medical care.</P>
    <P>The Fourteenth Amendment provides for the freedom to obtain, or to make available, information relating to services lawfully available in another state, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law.  I now propose to outline for the House the Government's proposals for legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to distinguish between two types of information.  The first concerns information provided by, for example, a doctor or an advice agency, to a pregnant woman who seeks advice concerning her specific circumstances.  It will be a requirement that, in such circumstances, information must be given in the context of non-directive counselling on the full range of alternative options available to the person concerned. &ldquo;Non-directive counselling&rdquo; means setting out all the available options in order to let the person make an informed decision for herself.</P>
    <P>I have been told that many Irish women arriving at clinics in Britain for abortions are found to have received no counselling before leaving Ireland.  Quite apart from adding to the anxiety and stress of the women concened, there is no doubt whatsoever that this results in abortions which could have been avoided.  Some women who would otherwise have had abortions choose, after counselling, to continue with their pregnancies.</P>
    <P>It has been submitted to me that, following the 1988 Supreme Court decision concerning information, doctors have been unsure of their legal position regarding counselling in crisis pregnancies. The proposed legislation will not only resolve this uncertainty, but will go further in a positive way by linking the provision of abortion information in crisis pregnancies with the provision of full non-directive counselling.</P>
    <P>The second type of information distinguished in the legislation will be information of a more general nature, which is not directed at the circumstances of an individual case, for example, general factual material which may be published <Col N="2066" /> in books or magazines or transmitted on radio or television.  Such information will only be permitted in so far as it is factual in nature and does not seek to promote abortion in preference to alternative courses of action.  It will also be a requirement that the services concerned, and the content of the information, must be fully in compliance with the law of the country in which the services are provided.  It is also proposed to include in the Bill a provision enabling the Minister for Health to make regulations on more detailed aspects of these controls, should they prove necessary.</P>
    <P>The legislation will completely prohibit certain methods of providing information such as billboards, wallposters or the distribution of unsolicited leaflets.  I am very much aware that there is a deep abhorrence of abortion on the part of many Irish people.  While there must be freedom to obtain information when it is needed, I do not think it would be considered acceptable that people would be confronted by abortion information on billboards or notices in public places, or on leaflets delivered through their doors. As in so many of the other issues in this entire debate, it is a matter of balance and the Government will strive in the detailed legislation to get the balance right.</P>
    <P>In finalising this legislation, I will, of course, take account of any relevant findings of the European Court of Human Rights in the case involving the Well Woman Centre, the decision on which is due to be issued on 29 October.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to stress again that the Government's proposals represent a careful and balanced response to very complex issues.  They will reinforce the constitutional protection of the right to life of the unborn, while ensuring that all necessary care is available to women suffering life-threatening medical conditions.</P>
    <P>There are those who consider the Government's approach too restrictive; there are those who consider it not restrictive enough.  I think that this debate will show that most of the genuine concerns expressed by those on each of <Col N="2067" /> these sides are in fact resolved when the Government's approach is examined carefully.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in detail with two of the three amendments.  The arguments in relation to the Thirteenth Amendment. on the freedom to travel, have been spelt out by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I fully support these.</P>
    <P>I am certain that the people, when called upon to vote in the three referenda, will edorse the balance in these amendments, and I urge all Members of the House to do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Opposition have made it clear that that cannot be the case.  I congratulate the Government on having fulfilled their commitment given at the time of the Maastricht Referendum, to hold a referendum on travel and information, and to put forward a solution on the substantive issue.  The sceptics, who predicted this would not be possible or who doubted the Government's <Col N="2068" /> good faith, have once again been confounded.</P>
      <P>The travel and information referenda have been broadly welcomed.  They also arise from the X case.  Interference with the freedom to travel is not acceptable in a modern, democratic state.  There is also a wide consensus that anyone in the situation that she would wish to seek an abortion abroad should at least be given all the alternative options and non-directive counselling.</P>
      <P>It would be illogical, however, if the Irish people were to be consulted about these matters and not the main issue of abortion itself.  Indeed, such a strategy would run the risk of having a negative impact on the chances of success particularly of the information referendum, if the opinion of the voter was to be confined to those more restricted aspects. The principle underlining the 1983 referendum was that the people would be consulted again, if there were any question of the legalisation of abortion in this country.  This question has arisen, unexpectedly, as a result of the recent Supreme Court judgment in the X case and therefore has to be addressed.  It would be a denial of democracy to allow the legalisation of abortion in this country, without the Irish people being consulted again.</P>
      <P>There are those on the Opposition benches who say that dealing with this matter by way of referendum has demonstrably failed.  I reject that argument. First of all, abortion as a public policy issue was bound to have arisen in some form or other in the past ten years.  It has been a deeply controversial and divisive subject in America, Britain, Germany and Italy.  In Belgium the King even abdicated temporarily for 24 hours, rather than sign the legislation passed in parliament. But we have to be able to grasp nettles and deal with them.  This the Government have done in putting forward these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael should not be allowed to forget the key role they played in 1981 in the decision to have this issue dealt with originally by way of referendum.  It was Deputy Garret FitzGerald and the then <Col N="2069" /> Senator Gemma Hussey who met the pro-life amendment campaign on 30 April 1981 and gave them an instant pledge without proper reflection as to whether this was the proper way to proceed. It left Fianna Fáil with little choice but to give a similar commitment a few weeks later.  Unlike Fine Gael, who had the cynical attitude to election pledges that they could be forgotten or watered down once they had achieved their purpose, Fianna Fáil back in Government in 1982 proceeded conscientiously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The fact is that Deputy FitzGerald's gross breach of faith with the electorate could not be stomached by several of his backbenchers or by nearly half of the Labour Party who voted to ensure that the original November 1982 <Col N="2071" /> wording chosen by Fianna Fáil was put to the people.</P>
      <P>The judgment of the Supreme Court decision in the X case was very controversial, has not been accepted as valid by many lawyers and was not reasonably foreseeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are we going through this now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of suicide was not raised by the then Attorney General or anybody else in 1982-83.  The 1983 amendment was based on the excellent principle of the equal right to life of the mother and of the unborn.  Few people other than those who are openly looking for a liberal abortion law, have challenged the principle.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court judgment in the X case requires us to further clarify the principle.  This the Government have done in a way that should be reassuring to mothers and pregnant women, removing any worries as to how the equal right to life principle could be interpreted in practice.</P>
      <P>The additional principle that is set out ensures that any pregnant woman who has a life-threatening condition will be given all the treatment she requires.  That will be the case, whatever the condition, and whatever the recommended treatment. Obviously, the doctor has an obligation, where possible, to have a live child born, but there is no sense at all in allowing both the mother and the foetus to die for want of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While medical opinion is divided, there is sufficient weight of evidence to suggest that termination may occasionally be required to save a woman's life.  This cuts across the direct/indirect distinction which is not of course a medical or legal one, and which could interfere with existing medical practice and introduce confusion and uncertainty for doctors, patients and the courts.  As the chairman of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 October, there is no consensus on the matter among the medical <Col N="2072" /> profession, and it is not a black and white area.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in that connection I note a rather striking contradiction between the position of SPUC in Britain, which supplied most of the literature for the Irish Pro-Life Movement during the Maastricht campaign, as set out in last Saturday's <i>Irish Press</i>, and SPUC here. SPUC in Britain frankly acknowledge: &ldquo;Of course abortion to save the mother's life was legal before the Act.  We do not dispute that it should be&rdquo;.  It would seem that there is a serious difference of view between SPUC in Britain and the SPUC branch in Ireland as to what is a realistic position to take.</P>
    <P>There is a folklore that goes back a long way about women with cancer, for example, being told by their priests or doctors that they may not be treated and that by implication they will be left to die.  Leaving people to die, when they could be saved, is not a pro-life position. It is the opposite.  Fianna Fáil in their proposal are very clearly repudiating that kind of inhumanity, to the extent it may still persist.  The substance of the proposal is very pro-woman and represents a significant advance in terms of clarification of the position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not bowed to pressures to use absolutist ideological language.  If this referendum were to be defeated, we will not be holding another one with a different, tougher wording. Either the referendum is passed, or abortion will remain legal, in cases where the woman claims to be suicidal with the backing of psychiatric experts.  All the international evidence suggests that that would create a dangerous loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael, while supporting the referendum, are asking for legislation.  I disagree. There is no case of the legislator coming between the doctor and the patient, and I detect little demand for legislation coming from the medical profession.  The legislator cannot foresee or enumerate all possible medical circumstances. <Col N="2073" /> It is far better to leave it between the doctor and the patient in accordance with clear general principles rather than to establish a maze of regulations. There is a further point.  If the Supreme Court, barring the question of suicide, in Deputy FitzGerald's words &ldquo;removed the ambiguity&rdquo; in the original wording, what possible objection can we have to incorporating the key passage in the Supreme Court's judgment word for word in the Constitution?</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the distinction drawn with regard to health.  We need to be clear why it is there.  It is drawn directly from the Supreme Court judgment, which parties opposite appear to approve of.  If the clause is left out, we could be faced with a Y case, where the meaning of the term &ldquo;life' is extended to include the quality of life, which is a nebulous concept, which could require us to hold some time in the future yet another referendum on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if you legislate. Define what you mean by the words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Fine Gael and Labour or most of the representative women's groups are demanding that a health risk should be sufficient ground for termination.  Are they familiar with the language of the 1967 Abortion Act in England which permits termination if the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk &ldquo;or injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman greater than if the pregnancy were terminated&rdquo;?  That is what has led to abortion on demand.  The language is very plausible, but it leads to results quite different from what may be intended. Are those who say they do not like the distinction saying that, in order to save the health of the mother, termination should be allowed?  Have they any proposals as to how such a clause could be implemented, without the risk of abuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have objected to the exclusion of suicide, though that exclusion at least is supported by Fine Gael with the exception so far of Deputy Fennell.  The reason it has been excluded is that it is obviously <Col N="2074" /> open to abuse.  It is very difficult ever to determine conclusively another person's intentions, even if one is a trained psychiatrist. It is therefore inadvisable to legislate for it.  Studies have shown this. In Minnesota between 1950 and 1965, when suicide was an allowable ground for therapeutic abortion, over 60 per cent of abortions took place.  Yet figures for actual suicides were negligible and in the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin during the seventies there was not a single case of national suicide recorded.  But anyone genuinely in that situation or the persons caring for them will have the option to travel, if that is the only other way out that they see, even though I am sure excellent counselling will be available.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken into consideration the views of the Church of Ireland.  Fianna Fáil have ensured both in 1983 and today that no sectarian languange is put in the Constitution.  The substance of the Government's proposal is very close to the Church of Ireland's own criteria of &ldquo;strict and undeniable medical necessity&rdquo; as the only justification of a termination.  While respecting their preference for legislation, I feel that would not be the proper democratic response.  I believe the general principle can work, and that it is actually better than legislation, because it leaves the responsibility with the medical profession, who I believe will have no serious difficulty working with the wording, as the President of the IMO has confirmed.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have a wider responsibility to society as a whole.  Our personal convictions, while important, cannot be our sole guide to sensitive and controversial social issues.  I believe the churches will respect, as they have often proclaimed in the past, the different role that they have in setting out their moral teaching, and our role as legislators, which must have regard to what is workable, practicable, and above all defensible in terms of public policy.</P>
    <P>As a country we are faced with many pressing economic and other problems.  I see no case for delaying and prolonging the debate.  The vast majority of the Irish <Col N="2075" /> people want a proposition to be put to them and to decide on it, so that we can all move on to other business as quickly as possible.  It is certainly not the Government that want to prolong any unavoidable diversion of public attention.  They have had the courage to take up a clear position on this most difficult of issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If anything, this debate has brought about a divergence of views.  One of the opinions which I have heard now &mdash; the gospel according to Deputy Briscoe &mdash; is that once people have spoken on this debate they should have no furthere act or part in it.  I resent that and also the implication that because Deputy Briscoe has chosen to complete his speech at midnight on Tuesday 20 October that should be the end of the debate. I would say to Deputy Briscoe that I was one of the legislators in 1983, and contrary to what the Deputy has now put on the record in 1992 &mdash; that in some way Fianna Fáil were innocent or had washed their hands of this problem &mdash; the facts are, and this was put on the record tonight by Deputy FitzGerald, that when the Government, on the advice of the Attorney General and in complete agreement with the Labour Party members of Cabinet, decided that the wording created a risk to the life of women, we proposed an alternative wording which Fianna Fáil rejected on the basis that they were not the words their party wanted. Indeed, some of the Members who are now Ministers said that the reason these words were being used by Fianna Fáil was that they were ambiguous.  That is what Fianna Fáil wanted in 1983; we tried to stop them in Seanad Éireann but they outvoted us and accused us during that campaign and on other occasions up to and including the last Presidential campaign of being in some way soft on abortion. I resent that as a Christian and indeed as a Catholic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this very important local issue.  The announcement by Melchert Electronics Limited that due to a downturn in business, coupled with the negative effect of exchange rate problems, they have been forced to make a number of workers redundant was greeted with great disappointment and concern by both the workforce and the people of Listowel and North Kerry.  It is expected that the number of redundancies will be in the region of 35.  However, I am fearful that there may be more job losses if the Government do not initiate an emergency relief programme to retain the maximum possible number of jobs in the factory.</P>
      <P>These job losses are a shattering blow to the economy of Listowel and its hinterland. Listowel is already a black spot for unemployment. Last week 1,900 people signed on for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit at the employment exchange; 700 of these are living within a six-mile radius of Listowel. The loss of these full-time jobs will add further to the existing gloom and with the approach of Christmas it is a harsh body blow to the families involved.</P>
      <P>Melchert Electronics Limited was established in Listowel in 1977 and commenced production of single-sided printed circuit boards with a workforce of ten people in July of that year.  This had grown to 40 people by the end of 1977. In 1985 a major extension was provided and in 1987 Melchert became part of Krupp Atlas Electronics Group.  In 1991 the workforce was 156 and turnover was in excess of £5.6 million.  The workforce now stand at 148.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Melchert Electronics has been a great and consistent employer over the years, with an excellent industrial relations record.  It has always been a highly regarded employer and has had a major impact on the economic life of Listowel and North Kerry.  Melchert manufacture <Col N="2077" /> customised printed circuit boards for all segments of the electronics industry.  It exports 48 per cent of PCBs to the United Kingdom.  Because of the decline in the value of sterling it has lost a considerable amount of money in the UK market. The whole electronics industry is going through a bad patch.</P>
    <P>If Melchert Electronics is to have a viable future in the very competitive field of printed circuit board production, it needs to upgrade its technology. However, there are no grants available for re-equipment from the IDA, following the decision by the Government to withdraw grants for upgrading equipment. I call on the Minister to reverse that decision and to restore grants for the modern technology required.  It is imperative that the Minister should provide assistance for Melchert Electronics from the market development fund of £50 million established by the Government recently to assist firms which have been seriously affected by the recent turmoil in exchange rates.  The dramatic fall in the value of sterling since mid-September has caused immense difficulties for Melchert Electronics.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid further redundancies and secure existing jobs it is vital that the Minister accept the application from Melchert management for a market development grant.  He should also make every facility available to them to ensure the survival of their company and workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been keeping myself informed of the situation affecting Melchert Electronics Limited and I share the Deputy's concern at recent developments which have led to the announcement of redundancies at the Listowel plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company performed well until recent years when losses were incurred due to severe price competition on the company's export markets.  The IDA were very much aware of these difficulties facing the company and, over the years, have been keeping in ongoing contact with the company's management in an <Col N="2078" /> effort to assist them in the long-term development of the Irish operation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the electronics industry is global in nature, highly competitive and characterised by short product life cycles.  The product segment of the market in which Melchert operate has in particular been subject to increasing price competition from the Far East and also rapid technological advancements in the production processes. These factors have tended to erode profit margins for producers in this market.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the IDA that the continuing recession in the UK has caused considerable difficulties for Melchert's Listowel operation and losses have accrued as a result.  This situation has been further exacerbated by the recent dramatic fall in the value of sterling and the ongoing turbulence in the currency markets.</P>
    <P>These factors are obviously a matter of serious concern to the German parent company and the IDA advise me that the company had no option, faced with severe competition, technological change and a deteriorating trading position but to implement 40 redundancies out of a total workforce of 150 approximately.  As the Deputy is aware, I have no direct responsibility for the action of the German parent company or any other firm in the running of its business. However, unfortunately, it must be appreciated that painful action is often necessary as to delay such action could lead to more drastic steps at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, acutely aware that manufacturing firms face serious difficulties in maintaining positive margins in sales in the UK market as a result in the change in the value of sterling.  For this reason, the Government have taken positive steps through the immediate establishment of the market development fund of £50 million for the period up to the end of March 1993 to assist firms which have been seriously affected by these developments.  This fund is administered by a special management team drawn from experienced executives from a number of State bodies.  The team <Col N="2079" /> is responsible for the day-to-day running of the fund, the operation of the eligibility criteria and all decisions on whether applicants qualify for support and the level of support, if any, to be made available.</P>
    <P>I understand from the IDA that Melchert has applied for assistance under the market development fund and every effort will be made to ensure that the company is facilitated, in so far as possible, to overcome the current problems. In this regard, I can assure the Deputy that the IDA are keeping in close touch with the situation at the company and I have asked them to continue to endeavour to ensure that every effort is made to safeguard the maximum number of jobs possible at the Listowel plant.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would add, that I am conscious of the employment situation in the Listowel area and of the impact, both economically and socially, of the job losses at Melchert.  I can assure the Deputy that both SFADCo and the IDA will continue to intensify their efforts to increase employment in the Listowel area.  Indeed, I understand that the availability of a 20,000 sq. ft. factory unit, which is in excellent condition, is a valuable asset in the overall marketability of the area for industrial development.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will realise, however, that while support agencies play an important role in helping industry develop and expand, much depends on the external trading environment.  It is, unfortunately, the case at the present time that many of the markets on which we depend, particularly the UK, are experiencing prolonged recession.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Bray-Shankill By-Pass Noise Pollution.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The Bray-Shankill by-pass was opened to traffic a year ago, on 24 September 1991.  Since then, a number of Shankill residents whose homes are close to the motorway have been plagued by noise.  The problem has been particularly <Col N="2080" /> acute for residents of Assumpta Park, Newvale and Crinken Glen Estate and for the residents of houses along the line of the motorway.</P>
      <P>One family whose house is only 90 feet from the edge of the motorway, in contravention of both EC and Dublin County Council standards, have reported to me that they are regularly woken at night by the sound of traffic.  Their lives have been totally upset by noise on the motorway.  They cannot sleep, the children cannot study, they cannot enjoy television and even conducting a normal conversation is virtually impossible because of the din from the new road. In response to these complaints Dublin County Council conducted a noise survey at five dwellings which are close to the motorway.  The survey showed that the average noise levels at the five houses were 57, 60, 63, 71 and 75 decibels respectively.</P>
      <P>On 22 July last the county council submitted a case to the Department of the Environment that funding should be provided for double glazing or other noise abatement measures at these houses.  By a letter dated 29 September the Minister for the Environment informed me that the UK standard of 68 decibels had been exceeded at two of the dwellings and that what he termed &ldquo;accommodation works&rdquo; had been agreed for these dwellings.  For the other houses, including the one which is only 90 feet from the road, he proposed no remedy but went on to state:</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the United Kingdom regulation has no statutory force in this country.  While there is no mechanism for noise reduction measures for properties not affected by land acquisition, the design of the scheme attempted to keep noise below acceptable levels by incorporation of mounds, walls, planting, etc., as part of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge this position and ask the Minister to reconsider the problems faced by the householders and provide funding for double glazing.  There are no official standards for noise here and we should not slavishly follow the UK standard.  The <Col N="2081" /> survey gave average results, but clearly at different times of the day the UK standard is considerably exceeded.</P>
    <P>Before the road opened the householders were promised that the noise problem would be attended to.  On 8 November 1989 Dublin County Council wrote as follows:</P>
    <P>Where necessary, noise abatement measures will be provided in the form of walls, fences and planting.  If cases of noise arise they will be dealt with on their merits.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the potential noise problem was taken into account in the design of the road.  Even if that was so, the road which was constructed is almost one metre higher than that which was designed or that which was approved by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The county council told me on 2 December last:</P>
    <P>The levels as constructed vary from .467 metres to .659 metres above those produced at the public inquiry.</P>
    <P>The public inquiry was presented with objections from householders about noise.  Clearly, the road built is considerably higher and consequently noisier than that which was approved following the public inquiry.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the noise levels are intolerable for householders, that promises were made to the householders before the road was opened that the noise problem would be attended to afterwards, that the road as constructed is higher than it was designed and that, notwithstanding the UK standards, the noise levels which have been shown in the survey are very high, I ask the Minister to approve funding from Dublin County Council to provide double glazing or other noise abatement measures to the limited number of houses involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the points raised by Deputy Gilmore.  I must point out that the Shankill/Bray by-pass was designed to minimise, in so far as possible, the <Col N="2082" /> effect of noise on residential areas.  Noise abatement measures, such as the provision of mounds, walls and other landscaping, have been provided by the local authority and have been funded from road grants for the scheme.  Dublin County Council have submitted a number of requests to my Department for funding towards the provision of double glazing for houses adjacent to the by-pass.  With regard to this question of double glazing, or indeed any other compensation matters, I would like to explain to the Deputy that compensation is only payable where land is compulsorily acquired.  The principles upon which compensation is assessed when land is taken under compulsory powers are well established and give the owner the maximum advantages under the compensation code.  The local authority were advised that compensation is only payable to property owners where property is compulsorily acquired and that, in such cases, compensation, in default of agreement, is determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that in a recent noise survey carried out on the council's behalf by the Eastern Health Board, noise levels in excess of the United Kingdom standard of 68 dB(A) were recorded at only two properties.  As both of these cases involved property acquisition, accommodation works were agreed as part of the compensation paid to the parties concerned.  While, of course, the UK standard has no statutory force here, I am satisfied that the measures already implemented by the local authority are more than adequate and any further remedial works are not considered necessary, Dublin County Council have been so advised.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tomato Industry.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue tonight.  On 14 October last I attended the opening of the National Tomato Production Conference in Malahide.  The hall was filled to <Col N="2083" /> capacity with growers from all over Ireland, deeply concerned for the future of their livelihood.</P>
      <P>I shared their deep disappointment at the absence of a Government Minister at the opening.  I am aware that the Minister responsible for horticulture, Deputy Hyland, who has shown his commitment to the industry was taking the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill in the Dáil.  However, given the crisis that exists within the tomato industry, and the fact that the growers were discussing the possible death of that industry, was it too much to expect the Minister of State, or indeed the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to be present to address the problems?  Once again, this shows that the Government continue to pay lip service to the horticultural industry.</P>
      <P>The year 1992 was an utter disaster for the tomato growers.  I wish to give some examples of prices on the Dublin market during 1991 and 1992.  In April 1992 the price was £5.96 per 6k box; in 1991 it was £8.15 per 6k box; in July 1992 the average price was £2.40 per box and in 1991 it was £4.47 per box.</P>
      <P>These figures show a net reduction of £1 per box compared with 1991, which represents a drop in income ranging from £15,000 to £25,000 per acre, which is totally unsustainable.  In recent years, the Irish tomato industry responded to the needs of the consumer and the ever increasing competition from imports. Production has increased substantially. Irish growers are now producing quality tomatoes with the highest standards of hygiene which compare favourably with the imported product.</P>
      <P>Tomatoes are a very important part of the horticulture industry and in 1991 consumers spent £10.5 million on tomatoes. A recent survey has shown that 90 per cent of consumers who buy tomatoes believe that the Irish produce is of better quality than the imported variety.  In view of this, I implore the major supermarket outlets here, in the national interest, to intensify their support of the home grown product by promoting quality Irish tomatoes within their stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> The industry is in crisis with, for example, in my constituency, some 300 direct and indirect jobs at risk.  If we are to entice growers to remain in the business, urgent action is required by the Government and Bord Glas.</P>
    <P>Growers need a fixed price structure for natural gas to enable them to plan ahead.  In this regard, I request the Minister to meet with the Minister for Energy and An Bord Gáis to initiate a favourable pricing arrangement for the industry.</P>
    <P>A continuing problem this year has been the importation of non-EC sourced tomatoes, particularly from Morocco and the Canary Islands.  Trade arrangements have been put in place which were designed to protect EC markets.</P>
    <P>This year these arrangements offered limited protection to our growers. Accordingly I demand that this issue be raised with the EC and I have no doubt that support will be forthcoming from other EC countries, including Great Britain, who are experiencing similar difficulties.</P>
    <P>When was the last time horticulture, and particularly the tomato growing industry, was raised at any EC forum? A case can and should be made by the Government to the EC to enable An Bord Glas to get regional structural funds for the disaster areas.  This is a disaster for the tomato growing industry.  Such funds could enable growers to overcome the current crisis and possibly diversify into alternative areas.  There is a sustainable case to be made for compensation. I ask the Government to give further consideration to this and also to meet with the banks to try to support the growers.  Finally, I ask the Minister to meet with the growers to discuss their problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Ryan for raising this very important matter.  I am aware of the concern about the difficulties being experienced by tomato growers.  They are the victims of a supply and demand situation which is exacerbated by the increasing volume of imports.  Because of <Col N="2085" /> our membership of the EC this latter problem is very much outside our control. Last week I had discussions with interested and concerned parties for the purpose of finding some solution.  I have to confess that a solution is difficult to find.</P>
      <P>Irish tomato growers produce a very high quality product.  Earlier this year I launched the quality symbol for Irish tomatoes and I wish to thank the Irish retail outlets for their willingness to promote Irish horticultural produce, particularly tomatoes.  An Bord Glas are also concerned and I will have further discussion with the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Brendan O'Donnell, with a view to further promotion of the Irish tomato industry.</P>
      <P>The present difficulties highlight again the importance of matching output with market capacity, something which all of us are extremely concerned about, in terms of planning the further development of the Irish horticulture industry.  It also brings home to us the need for a greater commitment on the part of the Irish consumer to quality Irish horticultural products.  I fully support Deputy Ryan's call to the retail outlets and to Irish consumers to have a commitment in terms of these products.  A cheaper imported product in the short term does not necessarily mean a saving in the long term.  More than ever we need a positive commitment to support the efforts of Irish workers by purchasing quality products that are produced by Irish workers in the horticultural industry.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed that I was not in a position to attend the conference to which Deputy Ryan referred.  I was in the House that day dealing with the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill. That should not be interpreted as a lack of interest on my part.  It is generally accepted that I am willing to meet with the growers.  I will be meeting with them, with the Deputy and other Members concerned, in the very near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the emigration and migration patterns of the forties and fifties many old age pensioners in Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Donegal and western counties have small British pensions. These are topped up by the Department of Social Welfare to bring the combined pensions up to the level of non-contributory old age pension entitlements. The amount these pensioners get from the Department is dictated by means-testing and is based on the size of their British pensions.</P>
      <P>However, the British pensions are paid in sterling.  Only a short while ago the exchange rate was IR£1 to 92p or 93p sterling.  Now the exchange rate is one IR£1 for £1.08 sterling.  Suddenly these old age pensioners have taken a drastic cut in their pensions.  The British element has declined in purchasing power here by maybe 15 per cent, depending on which day of the week it is or whether Michael Heseltine is opening or closing coal mines.  Legally and morally the old age pensioners are entitled to have the shortfall made good.  When sterling was riding high full account was taken of this in the means test.  Now, when sterling is in free fall appropriate adjustments should be made.</P>
      <P>There is another group of people involved &mdash; those who just missed qualifying for any Irish non-contributory old age pension and the various schemes that go with it because of the value of sterling. These people should be notified now and asked to reapply.  I am delighted to see the Minister here at this early hour of the morning and I ask him to ensure that the necessary adjustments are made immediately, not in six months time and not just on a once a year basis.  It is no answer to tell these pensioners to seek supplementary welfare or to meet the community care officers.  How would any of us react if, overnight, we had to take a 15 per cent cut in our pay?  These pensioners have a right under the Department's own rules to have the buying power of their pensions fully restored and with back money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons in receipt of pensions from the United Kingdom can experience gains or losses depending on the ongoing exchange rates between sterling and the Irish pound.  Many of those in receipt of pensions from the UK have experienced for some considerable time an improvement in income as their pensions gained in value during the period when the Irish pound remained below parity with sterling.  It is only in very recent weeks that this advantage has been eroded.</P>
      <P>Any person in receipt of a UK pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in the value of sterling may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension from my Department provided their means do not exceed IR£60 per week.  A UK pensioner who is already in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension whose means have dropped as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment.</P>
      <P>In assessing an applicant's means, account must be taken of any income which he or she receives, including income from outside the State.  In calculating the means, any such income the applicant receives must first be converted to Irish punts.  If current unfavourable sterling/punt exchange rates persist, these will be incorporated in an average exchange rate system used by my Department to assess means.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of UK pensions who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size should also contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre.</P>
      <P>It is not yet clear if the current exchange rates between sterling and the Irish punt are a temporary phenomena or are likely to continue in the medium to long term.  The matter in so far as it pertains to social welfare pensions, including our methodology in calculating the average exchange rate, is being kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past two weeks I have answered a number of questions about this.  It is <Col N="2088" /> only fair to point out that it would not be possible for my Department to assess all these people as a matter of course. However, anyone can have their means assessed if they wish.  The matter is being kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Social Welfare is present to deal with a case where the Department of Social Welfare seem to have presumed how a person should dispose of assets. The case concerned involves the disposal of assets by a man who suffered from a terminal illness and died a number of years ago.  It was his wish and that of his wife that the assets should be disposed of among their children and this was done. Certificates in this regard were lodged with the various banks in which the children held accounts.  His wife lodged an application for an old age pension and was awarded £2 per week but appealed this decision.  In the intervening period the Department assumed that she had disposed of the property with the intention of qualifying for an old age pension.</P>
      <P>This case is being dealt with under paragraph 2 (1) of the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  It goes beyond all reason for the Department of Social Welfare to claim that they are in a position or could be in a position to determine the reasons a dying man and his family decided the assets should be disposed of in this way. I ask the Minister to look at this case to see if anything can be done to help this woman as regards her claim for an old age pension in view of the fact that it is both genuine and valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am glad to see Deputy Kenny in the House tonight at a very late hour given that he might have other matters on his mind.  I should point out at the start that the person concerned has not been refused a widow's pension. She applied for a widow's non-contributory pension in June 1992.  As this is a means-tested pension it was necessary to investigate her financial and domestic circumstances in order to determine her entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2089" /> This investigation was initially delayed because the person concerned was temporarily resident with her son-in-law in Dublin and could not be contacted. There was a subsequent delay in obtaining details of her bank account.  The local officer carrying out the investigation has now completed her report, subject to verification of the person's household circumstances for entitlement to living alone allowances and to the various free scheme supplements.</P>
    <P>The investigation has indicated that the person concerned is likely to qualify for a reduced rate of widow's non-contributory pension of £13.20 per week.  It is also likely that the various supplements I have mentioned already will be payable in addition to this pension.  I have arranged for the file papers pertaining to the investigation to be sent immediately to the pension services office in Sligo who are responsible for making decisions on pensions.  As soon as the papers are received there, a formal decision will be made on the precise entitlements of the person concerned, and she will be notified immediately.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the Deputy has in mind an earlier application for old age non-contributory pension made by the person concerned in July 1991.  This application had to be refused because her means &mdash; including a portion of the capital proceeds from the sale of a public house &mdash; were above the statutory limit for entitlement.</P>
    <P>This capital is still being assessed against her in respect of her current pension application.  However, she is likely to qualify for a widow's pension now as I have already indicated.  This is because the means exemption limits are more generous in the case of widows.</P>
    <P>I should say to the Deputy that I have studied the file this evening and note that he asked a question about this case in January 1992.  As the Deputy will be aware, under social welfare legislation the appeals office are independent of the Minister and rightly so but given the Deputy's interest in this case over a long number of months and that I know he is a reasonable person and unlike other <Col N="2090" /> Deputies not given to raising such cases in the Dáil I will have the matter reviewed.  As I do not think the Deputy would spend all that time pursuing a case unless he believed that it was genuine I will have the case looked at again by the independent appeals officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue at this time and I will be very brief in view of the late, or should I say early, hour?</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter in response to the many letters I have received from people in Dublin and Cork who have asked me to raise it in the House.  I am aware that parents are greatly concerned in view of the effect the graphic posters in question have had on their children.  I am also aware that a court case is pending on foot of a formal complaint.  Only certain groups use these posters and they have been criticised by the broadly based pro-life organisations.  It must be recognised that there is public concern at this point in advance of the upcoming abortion referendum and any possible action on the matter should be clarified.</P>
      <P>The posters in question are greatly enlarged and distorted coloured pictures of early embryos.  These may be acceptable at a seminar or conference for adult viewing but in public they are distressing for certain groups, mainly pregnant women and children.  Indeed, I question the tactics of any group who use such posters and question how they could hold life so low that they would hawk objectivised aborted embryos in order to shock people.  Perhaps the Minister of State would indicate clearly the regulations that are in place regarding this type of display in public places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that on 24 September the pro-life campaign people issued a code of conduct for campaign workers and affiliated groups and said in their statement that graphic descriptions of abortion and its aftermath should not be displayed in public places or distributed indiscriminately.  They also said that no one should be required to look at such <Col N="2091" /> material or be confronted with it unexpectedly.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Fennell for raising this matter this evening.  I regret, of course, the type of campaign being carried out by some extremists in the run-up to the referendum proposed to be held on 3 December next.  The display of the type of posters referred to by the Deputy undoubtedly may affect some people's sensitivities but it is a matter for the law <Col N="2092" /> enforcement officers to decide whether such displays may constitute a breach of the law.  The law provides in effect that the display of any printed matter of an indecent or obscene nature is an offence and any complaint made to the Garda authorities that any such offence may have been committed will be investigated by them and referred to the law officers for direction in the usual way.</P>

      <P>All waste management planning is at present statutorily assigned to the major local authorities.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 does, however, permit the transfer of certain waste regulation functions to the Agency and it has already been indicated that consideration will be given in this context to transferring hazardous waste planning and management functions.  There is no proposal at present to organise non-hazardous waste planning on a national basis, and while all organisational options are being carefully considered in the preparation of the new Waste Bill, it is unlikely that a national organisation of this function will emerge.</P>
      <P>A national perspective on waste policy, as distinct from planning, has been developed in the recent discussion paper on waste issued on an informal basis by the Office for the Protection of the Environment. A copy of this paper is available in the Oireachtas Library.  A national study of waste recycling options has been commissioned by my Office and will also be published shortly.</P>

      <P>Securing the provision of a central hazardous waste incinerator to serve Irish industry is a standing policy objective. Following the decision of Du Pont (UK) not to proceed with their proposal for such an incinerator in Derry, hazardous waste disposal requirements are being actively reviewed in the light of factors such as emerging higher emission standards, changed market conditions and possible new incineration requirements.</P>
      <P>There is currently no firm proposal regarding the location or cost of a hazardous waste incinerator; any such proposal would of course be subject to the requirements of planning and environmental legislation.</P>

This latest submission from the council indicates that there has been a significant increase in both the size and cost of the proposal since the issue of approval in principle on 24 May, 1991.  My Department has recently asked the council to consider how costs can best be reduced without major alterations in the design and, on receipt of the council's response, the matter will be considered further.</P>

      <P>Last September, officials of Dublin County Council advised my Department that, in the course of discussions between local residents, the Garda and the local authority, agreement had been reached on a package of traffic management measures which might be implemented on the Neilstown Road.  The works involve the provision of 4 roundabouts together with traffic islands and safety barriers.  They are intended to reduce the speed potential of the road, which was one of the key suggestions which representatives of the residents of the area had brought to the notice of the inter-Departmental group dealing with certain problems in the Ronanstown area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decided to provide up to £150,000 in special road grants to meet the cost of implementing the works and the local authority was so informed on 8 September. The grants will be provided from funds which had already been set aside <Col N="1780" /> to implement any roads related measures that might be recommended by the Inter-Departmental group and they will be paid to the local authority as the works progress.</P>

      <P>Road grants totalling £30.919 million have been allocated to the three road authorities in the greater Dublin Area this year.  I propose to circulate with the official report details of the allocations to each authority showing, <i>inter alia,</i> grants for specific improvement works, and discretionary and block grants for non-national roads.  These latter supplement the provision made by the local authorities, from their own resources, for works on non-national roads.  The selection of works to be carried out from these funds is a matter for the local authorities subject to general guidelines by my Department.</P>

      <P>In regard to the final part of the Question, under the Fire Services Act 1981 it is the responsibility of the person in control of a premises covered by the Act &mdash; which would include most workplaces coming within the scope of the Directive &mdash; to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on the premises, and to ensure as far as it is reasonably practicable, the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.  The Building Regulations which apply to the construction of new buildings and to prescribed alterations to existing buildings provide for measures to protect such premises from fire.  Fire and building control authorities already have appropriate enforcement power.</P>

As such, it must remain within the limits set annually by the Government in the interests of overall economic and financial management.

      <P>New landfill sites are generally subject to environmental impact assessment. Further requirements on landfill which are being developed at EC level are likely to include more stringent controls on landfill practice, and national waste disposal policy will be developed in line with these requirements.</P>

      <P>The acceptance of tenders for the construction of the Northern Cross Route is a matter for Dublin County Council, subject to my approval.  On 17 September last, the council sought approval to the acceptance of a tender for Phase 1 of the project and this was conveyed on 8 October.  It is now a matter for the council to complete the requisite formalities and get the work underway.</P>
      <P>The overall cost of the project is currently estimated at £59 million and it is scheduled for completion by the Autumn of 1996.  The level of employment will be a matter for the various contractors involved.</P>

      <P>Comprehensive powers are available to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990 to deal with risks of pollution to inland waters.  These powers and other measures have been deployed with considerable success to reduce the number of fish kills caused by agriculture.  In 1987, that sector accounted for over 90 such incidents, while in subsequent years farm related fish kills have been in the low to mid-20s.  Farm surveys organised by local authorities and conducted by them with the support of Fisheries Board and Farm Development Service personnel have made a major contribution to this improvement.</P>
      <P>Important support is also being provided by measures undertaken under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Food, which since 1989, has provided grant assistance to farmers undertaking anti-pollution measures under the Programme for the Control of Farmyard Pollution. I understand that by the end of June 1992 storage facilities for 1.7 million cubic metres of farmyard waste, housing for nearly 490,000 animals and storage for 766,000 tonnes of fodder had been provided under this Programme.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food have promoted a greater level of environmental awareness among farmers by a number of means, including the distribution of a booklet on farm pollution.</P>
      <P>Teagasc and the farming organisations have also played a significant role in this area.  Control of silage effluent features prominently in the advisory and training programmes run by Teagasc which also undertakes a major publicity campaign on the matter each year.</P>

      <P>At present trade statistics are compiled by reference to the Single Administrative Document (SAD) which must be completed for every consignment imported into or exported from the State.  With the abolition of frontiers for tax purposes this document will no longer be required for trade between the member states of the European Community after 1 January 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the SAD is the major source of EC trade statistic which are vital in terms of economic and business planning, it was recognised that an alternative method of collecting this information was essential. This alternative method (referred to as INSTRASTAT) was provided for in <Col N="1801" /> Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3330/91 which was adopted on 7 November 1991.</P>
    <P>The INTRASTAT system will have significant advantages for traders compared to the existing SAD system.  The vast majority of traders will only have to complete two additional boxes on their VAT returns to meet their responsibilities while only the largest 6,000 or so traders will be expected to make a more detailed INTRASTAT return.  While a SAD has to be completed for every import or export consignment the INTRASTAT return need only be produced at the end of each month and the information given in monthly totals.  A typical SAD would require between 25 and 32 boxes to be filled in for each consignment as compared to between 11 and 13 boxes for a typical INTRASTAT return.  Moreover the SAD must be completed before goods can move while <Col N="1802" /> under the INTRASTAT regime the return can be completed anything up to one month later with goods moving without delays at frontiers.</P>
    <P>In summary, the new procedures will be less onerous, particularly in the case of small traders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reports issued in November 1990 and February 1991 the Revenue Commissioners indicated that a potential surplus of approximately 600 Customs and Excise staff would arise as a consequence of the planned completion of the Single European Market on 1 January 1993 and <Col N="1805" /> in particular the elimination of the fiscal frontier controls between member states.</P>
      <P>Since the issue of these reports the Commissioners have been working on proposals aimed at reducing the surplus staff figure.  The Commissioners issued a revised report in July 1992 which showed a net potential surplus of approximately 60 staff.  The reduction in the surplus figure has been possible because of Govenment decisions to give Revenue responsibility for the collection of EC Trade Statistics and the new VAT Information Exchange System post-1992 and for the administration of the new Motor Vehicle Registration Tax.  This new work will provide substantial employment opportunities for Customs and Excise staff, the details of which were made available to staff last July.  The revised report also identifies the Commissioners' staffing requirements for the expansion of some existing functions of the Customs and Excise service especially the strengthening of the common external border, increased control of drugs and other illicit traffic, improved Common Agricultural Policy control and post importation audit work.</P>
      <P>Furthermore as I stated in my budget speech the Commissioners intend to redeploy surplus customs and Excise staff to other areas of Revenue work particularly work related to the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion and avoidance.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of the Customs and Excise structures and staffing levels to cater for the post-1992 environment is well under way.  The Commissioners have made every effort to distribute the new and expanded work in a manner which will provide productive work for surplus staff at particular locations.  In the assignment of staff priority has been given to staff already serving in the locations in which posts have been made available.  A prime objective of this restructuring is to avoid domestic upheaval of staff if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staff have been notified of the provisional outcome of assignments within the reorganised Customs and Excise <Col N="1806" /> structure.  Staff have also been informed that an ongoing process will continue to identify employment opportunities in or close to their present locations for the remaining surplus staff numbers.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners now consider that the position outlined above obviates the need for a voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme of general application to staff in the Customs and Excise service.  Depending on the outcome of the ongoing efforts to identify employment opportunities for the remaining surplus staff numbers it is possible that a very limited VER scheme specific to certain posts and locations may need to be considered next year.</P>

The bank is not subject to any right of way and contains many Ash and Sycamore trees with attendant dense bramble and scrub which, aside from being an attractive feature along the canal bank, indicates it has not been disturbed for some considerable time.  The Commissioner's policy is to minimise interference with existing vegetation and <Col N="1807" /> wildlife and they have no plans to provide vehicular access along this bank.

Some difficulties in regard to legal title, concerning, in particular, the question of shared access to the site have been resolved and contract documentation for the sale of the property is awaited from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  It is expected that the property will be offered for sale before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 85/337 EEC lays down that &ldquo;Member States shall adopt all measures necessary to ensure that, before consent is given, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment&rdquo;<Col N="1808" /> are subject to an environmental impact assessment.  This Directive came into effect in 1988, three years after its notification.  As THORP, the extension to the Sellafield reprocessing plant, was approved by the UK Government in 1978, following a protracted public enquiry and parliamentary debate, it was not of course subject to such an assessment. However, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. have carried out an environmental assessment for discharges associated with THORP.  It was concluded that the level of proposed discharges does not represent a significant risk to the individuals exposed.</P>
      <P>In addition, under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, the UK authorities were required to submit to the EC Commission details relating to the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste from THORP.  In April this year, the Commission concluded, after having consulted a Committee of Experts drawn from member states, that the implementation of the plan was no liable either in normal operation or in the case of an accident to result in radioactive contamination significant from the point of view of health, or of the water, soil or airspace of another member state.  Notwithstanding this opinion, the Government considers that all discharges into the marine and aerial environment from Sellafield should be prevented and eliminated by the use of the best available technology and environmental practice.</P>
      <P>BNFL must now apply to the UK regulatory authorities for new authorisation for radioactive discharges from the Sellafield site, to take account of the operation of the THORP plant.  I have asked the UK authorities for a copy of the draft authorisation and when I have examined it, I will make appropriate views known to the UK authorities.</P>

      <P>I have been in contact with the British authorities to express my particular concern at the proposed shipment of plutonium and high-level wastes in the Irish Sea as a direct consequence of international contracts for increased reprocessing at the THORP plant.  In addition I have asked the Japanese Government to arrange for the cessation of any such shipments between Japan and Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I have been told by the UK authorities that a shipment of plutonium from the UK to Japan is not scheduled for a few years.  It is the UK's practice only to process and return plutonium if the recipient country adheres to the non-proliferation Treaty and has an appropriate internationally recognised safeguards regime in force to prevent any diversion of material for non-peaceful uses.</P>
      <P>I have been assured that all shipments will meet or exceed all the relevant international safety standards.  These include the use of containers designed to provide an extremely high degree of protection against fire, impact and other dangers. These international standards are kept under constant review and regularly updated to take account of experience and keep pace with technical developments; the most recent revision was published in 1990.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to raise this matter at all appropriate opportunities with the British authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>Expenditure under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme for the year ended 31 December, 1991 was £3.152 million.  The Grant-in-Aid paid to the Legal Aid Board which administers the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice for the same period was £2.357 million.</P>
      <P>Fees are paid to solicitors and barristers under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme by the Department of Justice and to barristers under the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice by the Legal Aid Board.  Solicitors providing services under the latter scheme are employed directly by the Legal Aid Board and are not paid fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest figures available for fees for Criminal Legal Aid and for Civil Legal Aid work are those for the year ended 31 December 1991 and 31 March 1992 respectively.  The amounts shown in respect of Criminal Legal Aid are the fees paid before deduction of withholding <Col N="1811" /> tax but they do not include payments in respect of Value Added Tax.</P>
    <P>In the case of payments by the Board under the Civil Legal Aid Scheme the amounts shown are the fees paid before deduction of withholding tax and include payments in respect of Value Added Tax.</P>
    <P>The other detail requested by the Deputy could not be made available without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources, which would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that interpretation of the law is not a function of the Minister for Justice.  That apart, I can say that the rights of the tenant fall in the first place to be dealt with by reference to the terms of the lease or other tenancy agreement which he or she holds.  The Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980 gives to tenants, in certain specified circumstances, a right to a new tenancy on termination of their existing tenancy. There is also provision, in limited circumstances, for compensation to be paid in lieu of a new tenancy.</P>
      <P>There are no steps open to me under landlord and tenant legislation in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Housing Acts are of course, a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the firearm in question was surrendered <Col N="1826" /> to the Garda Síochána in accordance with the provisions of the Firearms (Temporary Custody) Order, 1972 (S.I. No. 187 of 1972).  This Order required, in the interest of public safety, that every person residing in the State should, on or before 5 August 1972, surrender to the Gardaí any pistol or revolver or any rifled firearm of a calibre greater than .22 inches and any ammunition for such firearms. Since then it has been Garda policy not to issue firearm certificates in respect of such weapons.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Garda authorities have made exceptions to this policy in respect of a small number of persons involved in deer culling to whom certificates for higher calibre rifles have been issued.  The Garda authorities have informed me that they have recently conducted a review of the circumstances under which such certificates are to be issued and that when consideration of that review is finalised the application of the person referred to by the Deputy will be dealt with.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the serious allegations contained in the Irish Medical News dated 28 September 1992, that a substantial number of our foreign hospital doctors are either working or living here illegally as they do not hold the required visas or work permits as a result of confusion and departmental regulations and delays in the issue of these authorisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>If there is confusion about the matters raised by the Deputy in the question, it appears to arise principally in the mind of the author of the article in question.</P>
      <P>In the various Aliens Orders made under the Aliens Act, 1935, it is stipulated that a non-EC National may not enter the service of an employer in the State save in accordance with a permit issued to the employer by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Minister for Labour that all employers are advised that work permit applications must be made six weeks in advance of the non-EC National taking up employment.  I understand that the majority of applications for work permits in the medical sector are made in January and July each year.  I further understand that it is not <Col N="1829" /> unusual for work permit applications to arrive a day or two before the commencement of employment, or even after the employment has commenced.  The Department of Labour keeps this matter under review and I am informed that it has streamlined the process in consultation with relevant organisations, including the IMO, and that no undue delay occurs in processing medical work permit applications.</P>
    <P>As a matter of policy visas are not approved or issued until the relevant work permit has been approved by the Department of Labour.  Permission to remain in the State is, in general, not granted unless the person is able to furnish a copy of the relevant work permit to the Registration Officer of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The important point is the necessity for the employer to apply six weeks in advance for the work permit and for the holder of the work permit to present it to the Registration Officer when seeking an extension of permission to remain in the State.  If this time-table could be adhered to by all concerned, unnecessary difficulties could not be created.</P>
    <P>Finally, my office recently received a telephone request for a meeting from the Industrial Relations Officer of the IMO I have arranged for an official of my Department to meet the Industrial Relations Officer to discuss any matter that might be of concern to them.</P>

      <P>Therefore two are open to any area of study and one is confined to Music and Fine Art.  It is expected that students who apply for a scholarship would wish to do post-graduate studies in the field of their primary degree.</P>
      <P>A good knowledge of French or German is required as the courses are conducted in one or other of these languages. The last date for receipt of completed application forms is 20 November 1992.

      <P>Consultants were commissioned to assist my Department in a study to determine the need and provision for post-primary school places in the Castleknock/Hartstown/Huntstown/ Dunboyne areas.</P>
      <P>The findings of the study indicated that there was an immediate need for a new post-primary school in Hartstown to be followed by a new school in Dunboyne. The findings also indicated that the needs of the Castleknock pupils can continue to be met by the post-primary schools which currently cater for the majority of them.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Castleknock community does not accept the decision made in this case and their disappointment is understandable.  I would like to point out, however, that during the course of the study in question the consultants met with the local interest groups and their views were taken into account in the preparation of the report.

      <P>There is an acknowledged problem of adult illiteracy, in particular of functional illiteracy, in all developed countries and there is no evidence that the position in Ireland differs significantly from that of other comparable countries. However, due to the nature of literacy skills, there are considerable technical difficulties in estimating the level of illiteracy in any area at any particular time. Precise data is not available, therefore, on the number of those above the compulsory school leaving age in Dublin city and county with reading and writing difficulties.</P>
      <P>Addressing literacy problems is an element of general education, of training programmes, of programmes provided by grant-aided voluntary organisations and of my Department's specific Adult Literacy and Community Education scheme.  The Deputy will be aware that I have proposed, in the Green Paper Education for a Changing World, an in-depth survey to assess competency levels in various categories in reading and writing, including communicative and interpretative skills as part of the general strategy to combat deficiencies in literacy skills.</P>

      <P>The person named applied to my Department in July 1992 for an occasional passenger licence to provide a bus service between Borris and Carlow. Occasional passenger licences are issued in accordance with the terms of the Road Transport Act, 1932.  In considering whether to grant or refuse an application for a passenger licence under that Act, my Department is required to have regard to the extent of other passenger road services and other forms of public transport available on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.  In view of these restrictions, the scope for granting new licences to private bus operators is very limited.</P>
      <P>Consideration of this particular application was complicated by the fact that a number of applications had already been received for the provision of services on or in the neighbourhood of the route in question.  The complex issues raised by these prior submissions were only recently resolved.  Only then did it become possible to consider fully the application to which the Deputy refers. That process has now been concluded and unfortunately I find that in view of the services already available in the area it is not possible to issue an occasional passenger licence in this instance.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing the proposals for the liberalisation of the bus industry which have been prepared by my Department. As soon as I have completed this review I will be submitting comprehensive proposals in the matter to the Government. Major objectives of the proposed new legislation will be to improve the levels and quality of bus services available to the general public and to facilitate the introduction of competition on a sensible and orderly basis.</P>

Bad hand-writing was identified in the study as only one of the factors contributing to such errors. Although the study took place in the UK, the recommendations arising from it, which have appeared in medical and <Col N="1844" /> pharmaceutical publications, merit attention by doctors everywhere, including Ireland.</P>

      <P>The 1989 GMS contract changed the manner in which general practitioners were paid in respect of services for medical card patients from a fee-per-item to a capitation based system and also introduce a range of additional benefits for GPs.  This change, together with adjustments made following a review of the first year's operation of the new contract, resulted in a significant increase in the cost of general practitioner services in the scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy may be aware that on a successful conclusion to the current GMS Review, the Government has agreed to a recommendation arising out of an arbitration hearing, to increase the fees to doctors in the scheme by 17.5 per cent.</P>

The success of new techniques and forms of treatment which has improved the quality of life for many patients has, however, led to increasing demands being placed on the health services with a consequent effect on waiting lists and waiting times.  Waiting lists are kept under review and priority is given to urgent cases.

      <P>It was in recognition of the excellent work being carried out by the North West Hospice that my Department, through the North Western Health Board, paid a grant of £35,000 in 1991 and £35,000 in 1992 from National Lottery funds to this hospice movement.  Further funding arrangements will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the context of the many competing demands for resources throughout the health service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>Group water scheme grants and estimated local contributions would together provide only some 38 per cent of the financing required for these high cost schemes.  Their financing would, under present arrangements, require a substantial further grant from the budget for public water and sewerage schemes. Having regard to existing commitments under the water and sanitary services programme, it is not possible to indicate when these schemes may be approved.</P>

Because of the high level of commitments under the Water and Sanitary Services Programme generally, and the very high level of special grants that would be necessary for some group schemes, it is necessary, at present, to limit the extent to which new commitments for special grants are entered into.</P>

      <P>An important function of the committee is to interpret the Covenants so as to guide States parties in the application of the Covenant and in the preparation of their national reports.  This is done by means of guidelines which are reviewed and updated periodically by the committee.</P>
      <P>Documents containing the guidelines to date issued by the Human Rights Committee are being provided to the Dáil Library for the information of Deputies.</P>
      <P>Ireland's First Report under Article 40 of the Covenant was published in September 1992 and copies have been distributed to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>A review of this case indicated that the person named may have applied for special beef premium scheme grants in 1991 on three animals which qualified for payment already in his own herd in 1990.  Since male animals which qualified for grants in 1990 should not have been the subject of a claim in 1991 further investigation is necessary to ascertain if the 1991 claim of the person named is an irregular claim.  A query in the matter will be sent to the person named shortly. Until this issue is resolved his eligibility for an extra grant or indeed for grants already paid cannot be established.</P>

      <P>The scheme is directed primarily at giving an incentive to employers to provide full-time job opportunities for unemployed people.  I am not satisfied that the same level of incentive is required in the case of employers taking on part-time workers.
