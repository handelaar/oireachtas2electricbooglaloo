      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Ireland participated actively in the UN Conference on Environment and Development, UNCED, which took place in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Daly, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, with special responsibility for the protection of the environment, Deputy Harney, participated at appropriate times.  I attended the Summit segment of the Conference and addressed it on 13 June.</P>
      <P>This was an historic event, involving the participation of well over 100 Heads of State or Government from nearly all parts of the world.  I wish to thank the Government and people of Brazil for their generous hospitality and their outstanding commitment in hosting a conference on this scale.  The Chairman of the Conference, the Brazilian President, Fernando Collor, brought considerable skill to bear on the proceedings and ensured a successful outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="UNCED UNCED">
      <NameTxt>UNCED</NameTxt>
      <P>will heighten public consciousness of the major development and environmental problems facing mankind on this earth.  According to the UN, these include: population growth which will see an increase of nearly 100 million people in the world each year through the nineties; desertification which now threatens one third of the world's land, affecting 850 million people, changes in the atmosphere through carbon dioxide emissions &mdash; particularly by major industrial powers and through the burning of forests &mdash; which contribute to global warming; the discharge of chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs, which break up the layer of stratospheric ozone that protects us from cancer-causing rays of the sun; and pollution of the oceans through the dumping of untreated sewage, and chemical, including nuclear waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="UNCED UNCED">
      <NameTxt>UNCED</NameTxt>
      <P>was the first global meeting <Col N="583" /> at the highest political level since the end of the division of the world into two political blocs.  There was a hope at the Conference that the ending of the old divisions should help to release energies and, given that there was now less need for huge military budgets in some countries, resources for more constructive action by the international community on the sort of problems I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Conference has resulted in the adoptions of a number of important measures.  The Rio Declaration, which is a charter of basic principles about environment and development, was adopted by all participating countries.</P>
      <P>I signed, on behalf of Ireland, two major new conventions on climate change and biodiversity.  These will commit participating countries to limiting greenhouse gas emissions and taking measures to prevent destruction of genetic species.  Special funds will be established under both conventions and will be financed by developed countries, including Ireland, to help developing countries with implementation.  These funds will, initially at least, be administered by the new Global Environment Facility of the World Bank.</P>
      <P>Agenda 21 is the central part of the UNCED conclusions.  It establishes a set of practical programmes for action on climate change, the ozone layer, air and water pollution, the contamination of the oceans and seas, and other global environmental problems.  It also covers all the traditional areas of development policy, including action to combat poverty, health and education, the role of women in the development process, changes in consumption patterns &mdash; especially in industrialised countries &mdash; and the impact of population trends. Ireland will implement the environment aspects of Agenda 21 through our national environment action programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resources needed by developing countries for Agenda 21 were one of the key questions at Rio.  Developed countries reaffirmed their commitment to reach the accepted UN target of 0.7 <Col N="584" /> per cent of GNP devoted to ODA and, to the extent that they have not yet achieved that target, agreed to augment their aid programmes as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Contributions are to be made by a number of large countries or regional organisations, including the European Community, to provide money for the start up of Agenda 21 in developing countries.  The EC initiative will involve the commitment of three billion ECUs to key sectors of Agenda 21 such as poverty relief and food production.  I have said that Ireland will participate fully in this initiative.  It will be part of the planned programme in increases in our Official Development Assistance in the period 1992-94.</P>
    <P>A major concern of UNCED was to halt the destruction of tropical rainforests, which, on food and agriculture organisation estimates, have decreased by some 200 million hectares over the decade to 1990.  These forests are vital to the earth's ecological balance.  The negotiations were difficult but, in the end, UNCED agreed that work should now quickly proceed on a convention to assist African and other affected countries.  A Commission on Sustainable Development is to be set up within the UN system to provide for monitoring of implementation. As soon as the definitive documents from the conference become available, I will arrange to have them placed in the Library.</P>
    <P>The success of the Conference will be measured by the action taken to implement these various measures.  The consensus in Rio was that a significant start had been made in focusing attention, at the highest level, on the developmental and environmental problems facing the world, north and south, and the place of mankind on this earth.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government assisted the attendance at the parallel Global Forum in Rio de Janeiro of representatives from Irish environment and development non-governmental organisations.  I was glad to have the opportunity of visiting the forum and acknowledging the commitment and dedication of its participants from many <Col N="585" /> parts of the world.  The Government also facilitated the attendance at UNCED of four representatives from Dáil Éireann, thus enabling them to participate in a number of meetings organised in parallel with the conference.</P>
    <P>During my visit I had a number of bilateral meetings.  I met the Prime Ministers of Portugal, which at present holds the Presidency of the European Community, Sweden, and Malaysia and the First vice-President of Iran, for discussions on matters of mutual interest and concern, as well as with the British Prime Minister.  I will be answering separate questions on this meeting.  I also took the opportunity to become acquainted with many other world leaders who were present in Rio.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have no proposals to change the allocation of ministerial responsibilities for the environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be calling Deputies in the order in which their questions appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has just read a reply to four questions but what we should be having here is a debate on the Rio de Janeiro Summit because many more questions need to be answered.  I am extremely disappointed that the Taoiseach is going to make no changes in ministerial responsibility as a result of the Summit, which has focused the attention of Ireland and the world on our responsibility to future generations for the protection of the environment.  At present responsibility is spread over at least seven Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must proceed by way of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that as so many people are responsible for protecting the environment, nobody has primary responsibility? The Minister for the Environment is really Minister for local government. Does the Taoiseach not think it would be much more appropriate if one member of the Government was given responsibility <Col N="586" /> for all aspects of the environment rather than giving responsibility to the Departments of Health and the Environment, local authorities, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Energy?  It would be much more satisfactory from the point of view of the Government and the public if one single Minister in the Government was responsible for this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The length of time it took this House to pass legislation setting up the Environmental Protection Agency is a clear reflection of the Government's commitment to the protection of the environment and indeed there is also an environmental action programme dealing with this matter.  I do not accept what the Deputy says, that we cannot make the desired progress under the present structures.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that we are proceeding with the protection of the environment in terms of our action programme while at the same time ensuring that sustainable development takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions.  The Taoiseach told the Rio de Janeiro Summit that Ireland had, to use his words, a planned programme of increases in Ireland's overseas development assistance for the period 1992-94.  I understand that our present level of assistance is 0.17 per cent of GNP.  May I ask the Taoiseach what is the planned level of ODA for the years 1993 and 1994?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, as a former Minister for Finance, knows full well that nobody should anticipate increases in expenditure from year to year.  That is a matter for the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should not be making statements like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must also be aware that the revised Programme for Government states that the Government will undertake a planned programme of increases in Ireland's official development <Col N="587" /> assistance from 1992 to 1994 so as to achieve a higher ODA-GNP contribution by the end of that period.  Successive Governments have also expressed support for the long term objective of reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP being devoted to ODA.  That is the commitment in the Programme for Government and, as the Deputy will be fully aware, we reach our expenditure Estimates every year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I indicated at the commencement of questions that I would be calling Deputies in the order in which their questions appear on the Order Paper, and I am doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I indicated without any interruption from you, Sir, that I intended to ask two questions. The fact that I allowed the Taoiseach to answer the first of those questions should not act to my disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am adhering to my original decision in the matter and I will call the Deputy again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had two questions to ask the Taoiseach.  Will you not allow me to ask the second question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My question No. 3 relates specifically to the Government's timetable for increasing ODA.  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach would indicate what the timescale is and to what extent the commitment to increase ODA will be fulfilled.  What portion of an increase will there be?  May I also ask the Taoiseach with regard to the conventions signed at the Rio Summit what policy implications there are for this country arising from those conventions and what resources will be provided for the implementation of those policy implications? <Col N="588" /> Finally, would the Taoiseach provide for a debate on the Summit as soon as the documents are made available in the Library?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in considering the request for a debate on the outcome of the Summit when the documents become available.  As to the other aspect of the Deputy's question, the timescale for the programme of increasing contributions is, as I have already stated and as is enshrined in the Programme for Government, 1992-94.  I would also inform the Deputy and the House that during the Summit the EC made a commitment of three billion ECUs to give a kick start to agenda 21 and, of course, I committed Ireland to full participation in that.  This is in addition to the ODA level of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to a full debate on the resolutions of the conference at Rio de Janeiro.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that he will have the support of all parties in this House in relation to the Government's efforts to increase our overseas development aid, but the problems of Africa probably will not wait until we produce our budget next January.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should take the initiative at the next Summit and call upon our EC colleagues to take positive action in relation to the forthcoming disasters, which we have all read about in recent days, that are inevitable on the sub-Continent of Africa unless immediate action is taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform Deputy Spring that in my discussions both in Rio de Janeiro and last Thursday with the Prime Minister of Portugal &mdash; which holds the Presidency of the Council &mdash; the threatening famine in Africa was raised and I have little doubt that it will be on the agenda for discussion next weekend.  I would be glad to discuss in the House, when all the documentation is available, the outcome of the Rio Summit and its implications for Ireland in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="589" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that he has no need to wait until the summit of EC partners in Oporto to make a statement that the Irish Government are prepared, in view of the emergency developing in Africa, to make additional funds available?  If the Taoiseach wishes that the House provide a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs for official development aid I can assure him that this side of the House will be more than willing to make the time available this week.  Would the Taoiseach agree that some of those who read his statement in Rio de Janeiro that there is, to use his words, a planned programme of increases for the next two years in ODA will be disappointed to hear today that the Taoiseach cannot give a figure for next year let alone for the year after?  May I ask the Taoiseach further, to explain a statement he made in his speech in Rio de Janeiro to the effect that when he returned to Ireland he would be asking all our development agencies to review their schemes to ensure that they are based on sound ecological principles, so as to provide for sustainable development of natural resources?  Does that statement indicate that the Taoiseach views some of the work currently being done by our development agencies as not being based on sound ecological principles and in need of prompting from him to ensure that it is so based?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm to review all schemes from time to time to ensure that money is being spent in the way we would like.  There is nothing wrong with reviewing schemes, and the schemes in this area are no different to any others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question was, if the Taoiseach would agree that the situation in Africa is so urgent that it would justify him not waiting for the Summit but providing for a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs, this week?  The second question was, will the Taoiseach agree that there may be some disappointment amongst those interested in ODA when comparing the Taoiseach's reference to a &ldquo;planned&rdquo; increase in the next two years in ODA, and his inability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What action have the Government taken in relation <Col N="591" /> to the reprocessing plant at Sellafield?

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that he could be accused of hypocrisy, if not fraud, in claiming that his Government were planning increases in ODA, when the level of ODA provided for this year is 0.17 per cent of GNP which is the lowest it has been since 1981? Will the Taoiseach explain how the revised Programme for Government, which was drawn up in October, promised a planned increase in ODA when there has been a reduction this year?</P>

Arising from Deputy Spring's question, I wish to point out that at the EC Council of Ministers meeting, six Governments committed themselves to reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent by the year 2000, three committed themselves to reaching that target as soon as possible and three would not even give that lukewarm commitment, including our Government.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6,7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are delighted at the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Europe given by almost 70 per cent of those who voted last Thursday. The result will give renewed momentum to the ratification of the Treaty on European Union across the Community.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is perhaps fortunate for Europe that we chose to hold a referendum a fortnight after Denmark.</P>
      <P>The result in Ireland is a further clear endorsement of this country's com mitment to Europe.  It is the third European Referendum to have been won by a convincing margin and shows that our people want a place in the front rank of European nations, and clearly wish to further the ever closer union of the peoples of Europe, of which the Rome Treaty speaks.</P>
      <P>It was a hard-fought campaign.  A lot of deeply emotive issues were raised which had nothing to do with the question on which people were being asked to vote. I have no hesitation in saying that the result is a tribute to the maturity of our people, who could see what the issues really were.  They exercised their democratic right to take their own decision. The result vindicated my decision to proceed with the Referendum at an early date, as a matter of national priority, in the discharge of our international responsibilities.  I was criticised at the time by various commentators for rushing my fences.  How wrong they were. The Irish people have given their answer to that type of criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partisan attempts were made to misrepresent <Col N="598" /> the Government's case as resting solely on the promise of £6 billion.  I always made it clear that that was the Commission proposal, which we fully supported.  Indeed, who ever heard of a negotiator entering a negotiation by offering to take less than is being proposed? As I said at the launch of the White Paper, &ldquo;the outcome may not be exactly as proposed by the Commission&rdquo;. That is quite simply because the final decision does not lie with the Commission.</P>
    <P>As for those who claim the Government's campaign was badly fought, this I totally reject and, the bottom line, an excellent result has been achieved, so we cannot have got it all wrong.</P>
    <P>We went to considerable lengths to provide information to the electorate in usable form.  The Treaty and the clear and comprehensive White Paper, published by the Government, were made available in public libraries and main post offices and was on sale at the Government Publications Offices.  It would have cost over £6 million to circulate the Treaty to all households.  Having regard to its complexity, its use of cross-references to the other Community Treaties and its availability in public libraries and main post offices, such an expensive distribution could not be justified.</P>
    <P>Instead the Government's short guide was distributed to every household.  It was described in <i>The Economist</i> as &ldquo;one of the clearest produced&rdquo;.  A series of other information leaflets was produced. There was a great deal of information published in the media by the Irish Council of the European Movement and by other bodies supporting a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  In the last week of the campaign we established a free telephone information service which dealt with about 4,000 calls from the public.  Deputies will also recall the statement of 9 June agreed between the leaders of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy John Bruton, the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring and the Progressive Democrats Party, Deputy Des O'Malley, which received wide publicity.  My broadcast on Tuesday night last was in response to a widespread demand that I <Col N="599" /> should go on the airwaves to explain the issues simply and clearly to the people.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank my own party and all other parties who campaigned for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for their support.  I believe that the statement I made jointly with the other party leaders was important in consolidating support for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; result. I believe that the standing of politics in this country was enhanced by the responsible action taken on this occasion in the national interest by the party leaders.</P>
    <P>My own party played a full part in the campaign, especially in the latter stages. I would also like to pay tribute to the trade unions, the employers, the farm organisations, as well as bodies like the Council for the Status of Women for clear statements of support.  Great credit is also due to the Irish Council of the European Movement.  We succeeded on this occasion in building an unprecedented national consensus, both at the political level and among the mainstream representative organisations.</P>
    <P>However, we never regarded the result as a foregone conclusion nor did we believe the initial opinion polls taken. The campaign here, including the experience with the freephone service, has shown up that there is a deficit of information about European developments. This will have to be improved, both here and in other countries, if the Community, in its desire to make further progress, is to carry the people with it.  The proposed Joint Committee on European and Foreign Affairs will no doubt play a useful role in this.</P>
    <P>It is very important, as was emphasised by both the Portuguese Prime Minister, who is President of the European Council, and myself at our meeting here on Thursday last, that the commitments made in the European Union Treaty, especially in regard to cohesion, be honoured in full and I will push this vigorously at next week-end's meeting of the European Council in Lisbon.  Continuing support for European unity depends on the ability of Europe to look to its smaller and less developed economies, as well as to its core regions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> In short, through this magnificent result, we have succeeded in putting European Union back on the rails.  I would hope that when the time for the ultimate decision comes, Denmark will decide to join and we in Ireland would certainly welcome their full participation.</P>
    <P>On Thursday last, Ireland demonstrated that it possesses a true European vocation.  This will enhance further this country's standing in Europe and should strengthen our negotiating position in EC fora.  Europe is not just about a group of countries agreeing to trade and work together.  In today's increasingly interdependent world, it is a Community whose aim is to foster peace by increasing prosperity, and to encourage stability by reducing the differences between the various regions.</P>
    <P>It is also a noble ideal, involving the deepening of solidarity between the European peoples, while respecting their respective histories, cultures and traditions. It also has the potential for a constructive and unselfish European role in promoting peace, liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and prosperity throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that once the Treaty is ratified throughout the Community, the Government here and all Ministers directly concerned will avail of every opportunity to press for its full implementation in the interests of the people of Ireland, of Europe, and of the world at large.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate to congratulate the Government on their success in the Referendum campaign.  As one of my party spokespersons said, it was a battle between David and Goliath and on this occasion Goliath won.  When does the Taoiseach expect the Joint Committee on European and Foreign Affairs to be up and running?  Is it proposed to maintain the current restriction in the draft terms of reference of that committee which specifically excludes discussion by that committee of the negotiating position of the Government on EC matters?  This would render that committee virtually useless in terms of <Col N="601" /> monitoring developments at EC level. Will the Taoiseach indicate his attitude with regard to current proposals on increased Structural Funds and the intention to maintain the current level of funding for two years, with increases starting to apply from the third year?  It appears there will be no increases for at least two years.  What other measures does the Taoiseach intend to take, other than the establishment of the European and Foreign Affairs Committee, to increase awareness of foreign affairs among the general public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed new Foreign Affairs Committee is a matter for discussion between the Whips.  Discussion is continuing at that level and I do not propose to discuss the matter further here.  Regarding the Deputy's reference to a proposal not to increase Structural Funds for two years, he may be misreading some press reports in that regard.  Some member states say there is head room in the present level of resources that could accommodate proposals for Structural Funds without further increases for the next year.  I would not regard that as being possible for the second year but for one year it is quite likely.  The question of Structural Funds is at the negotiating stage and will be the subject of many more meetings in the future.  It will certainly not be concluded at the Lisbon Summit this weekend. We will continue to press for and to support the proposals by President Delors and the Commission for a doubling of Structural Funds for Ireland.  That proposal will not necessarily become the victim if there are no increases in the level of resources in 1993, should the summit or the Council of Ministers decide that.  It may or may not happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek information on two aspects.  The Taoiseach accepted in his reply that there was an obvious deficit of information in relation to European developments and one to which the electorate reacted very strongly.  Would the Taoiseach accept that there is a very strong argument for having two committees <Col N="602" /> of this House, the Foreign Affairs Committee and a separate European committee?  It is urgent and important to have a coherent committee for policy development which will allow the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the Minister in charge of European affairs, to consult with colleagues in this House on a regular basis prior to making the Government's input at senior level meetings.  Would the Taoiseach envisage a role for our MEPs in that regard?  What do the Taoiseach and his colleagues at prime ministerial level envisage happening to the Maastricht Treaty in the event of the Danes not ratifying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the latter part of the question first.  The question does not arise until all other eleven member states have completed the ratification process.  None of us is entitled to take the view that the position will remain as it is today.  In relation to the Foreign Affairs Committee, discussions are continuing with the Whips in that regard.  I understand there was a proposal to have a special sub-committee to look at the European aspect of foreign affairs. Part of that proposal is that MEPs should attend and make contributions.  That is very desirable.  The information deficit arises in trying to transmit information about what is happening in the European Parliament, the policies being developed there and the views of members, as well as some aspects of policy emanating from Brussels.  There is an onus on MEPs, and on the information service of the Commission and the European Parliament, to improve matters.  I have already said it is desirable that MEPs should attend and make contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has already answered many of the supplementary questions that might have been prompted by these questions.  In view of large-scale disquiet across Europe about access to information about Europe and the Maastricht Treaty, and having regard to the fact that the national parliaments of the 12 member states are currently televised and accessible to the public, is the Taoiseach <Col N="603" /> prepared to raise in Lisbon the possibility of having meetings of Councils of Ministers open to the public and to the cameras, so that the suspicion of behind-closed-doors deals can be removed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain aspects with which I would not agree but perhaps I would agree on other aspects where information could perhaps be improved.  Councils of Ministers have to be responsible to their national parliaments and to stand over the decisions they have taken.  That is their responsibility. I do not see any disregard for the general public in relation to information. Information emanates from Government decisions.  After every Council meeting the media are there to find out what took place and they know the exact agenda.  I do not see any great deficit there.  There are many aspects of meetings of Councils of Ministers which I would not be in favour of opening to the general public, just as is the case with Cabinet meetings.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that some of the so-called information deficit could be corrected by having more frequent debates in this House on the reports produced by the Department of Foreign Affairs every six months and the reports produced by a European affairs committee?  The holding of such debates would give a better chance that such reports would come to the attention of the general public, due to the attendance of the press, who frequently do not attend meetings of the EC committee.</P>

      <P>I have made my position abundantly clear since I took office as Taoiseach.  I said I was in favour of more open debate and I have facilitated <Col N="604" /> Opposition parties with a couple of debates on the Maastricht Treaty.  We will certainly consider in the context of Friday sittings how we can accommodate more debates on reports of European meetings and how we can best inform the general public.  This matter must also be tackled by the European Commission's information service and by the European Parliament and its members.  They have a responsibility to communicate better with the Irish public who are their electorate and who want to know more about what is going on.</P>

      <P>Does any contingency plan exist to deal with the situation, which we hope will not occur, if the Danes do not ratify?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the Delors II package is a five-year programme and that therefore it is irrelevant that other member states refer to the possibility that there might be head-room for one year since that is tantamount to a rejection of the Delors II five-year approach?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the experience of the referendum would suggest that it would be useful if the Government of the day were to publish a Green Paper in advance of the opening of negotiations on the next intergovernmental conference setting out what the Government hope might be achieved, so that public debate on the subject would we well informed from the beginning, rather than having to publish a White Paper to inform people about what is already a <i>fait accompli?</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will look at the latter part of the question.  The Deputy appears to be under a misunderstanding. The case being made by member states in relation to raising the level of resources is not being put forward as an argument to reduce any part of the Delors II package. That argument is being put forward by certain member states who say that if there is sufficient available resources to look after the expenditure side of the Commission why should it be raised in 1993.  That does not mean that funds would not be available for the Delors II package even if there was no increase. <Col N="605" /> We will continue to look for an increase. The Deputy should not be shaking his head; that is the reality.  I am at the table and I know the position.  If the Deputy does not want to believe what I said that is fine, but that is the reality.</P>
      <P>I discussed this matter with the British Prime Minister in Rio and he made comments similar to those I am making today. We will leave the matter for discussion and negotiation and we will come back to it in this House.  I should like to reinforce what I said, the increase being sought is from 1.2 per cent to 1.37 per cent, an increase of .17 percentage points at a time when the projections for the results of economic and monetary union would be for an inclusive 15 per cent of growth in GDP.  That is the basis of my argument for the increase, not the question of whether there may or may not be head-room.</P>

We will stand ready to contribute in every way we can to its successful outcome. Statements made by other party leaders who are participants in the talks, whether at Strand I, II or III, are matters for themselves.  In relation to the statement made in Bodenstown last Sunday, one would hope it represents some significant change, I do not know; one would have to be extremely cautions.

As the building regulations are in operation for less than one month, the question of meeting the time limit has not yet arisen in practice.</P>

The developments have been greatly welcomed. The seminars attended by the technical services and the local authorities did not result in any indication to me of problems in relation to meeting the time limits provided in the regulations.

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he will carry out an investigation into non-competitive practices in road material supply, as was recommended by the Director of Consumer Affairs; if his attention has been drawn to the discrepancy in prices between different regions in the country; if he will outline the cost comparisons between local authorities for road laying throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Road material supplies are purchased by local authorities on foot of open competitive tenders.  In the absence of evidence of collusion or anti-competitive practices, which would provide a basis for action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, I do not propose to carry out an investigation in relation to such supplies, nor have I received a recommendation from the Director of Consumer Affairs that I should do so.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the director received a complaint early in 1991 about anti-competitive practices in the supply and distribution of asphalt and had the complaint under investigation under the powers conferred on him by the Restrictive Practices Acts 1972 and 1987 until the end of September 1991, during which period, I understand, the director found no evidence that would substantiate the complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 1 October 1991, following the coming into operation of the main provisions of the Competition Act, 1991, and the repeal of the relevant provisions of the 1972 and 1987 Acts, the director advised the complainants that should they wish to pursue the complaint further it would be necessary for them to take a civil action on their own behalf.  At the same time, the director advised my Department that it would be open to the Department to bring the matter further if there was evidence of collusion or anti-competitive practices in relation to prices.  However, in view of the lack of such evidence emerging from the director's investigations over a period of several <Col N="614" /> months and the lack of such evidence in the Department, the matter was not pursued.</P>
    <P>The compilation of cost comparisons between local authorities for road laying throughout the country would involve an inordinate amount of staff time and cost which would not be warranted in the absence of any evidence of collusion or anti-competition practices in relation to prices in the area.  However, if the Deputy has evidence in this regard I will be prepared to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat disappointed at the Minister's reply.

There is disquiet about this matter.  In certain parts of the country there is evidence of collusion whereby high prices are being maintained, and the same prices do not apply across the country.  I ask the Minister to carry out an investigation in his own Department to ensure that the taxpayer gets the best value for money.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in this regard there is a system of open, competitive tendering.  Figures made available to me in recent months show a 10 per cent decrease this year in some tendering costs.  I do admit that there are disparities between different parts of the country, which could in some way but not fully be explained by distance from the point of supply.  If I find any evidence in support of the allegation made by the Deputy I shall be quick to take action.</P>

      <P>I refer to the full statement on the outcome of UNCED which the Taoiseach has made in response to earlier questions today.</P>
      <P>Implementation of, and follow-up to, the agreements reached at Rio will involve action by a range of Government Departments and public bodies, as well as by the non-governmental and private sectors.  The implications for national environmental policy will be addressed through the environment action programme, which is subject to regular review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of UNCED objectives and, in particular, those of Agenda 21, will have resource implications for all countries, with the bulk of these requirements having to be met from internal sources.  Agreement has, however, been reached in this context for the provision of new and additional resources to developing countries.  These will be provided <Col N="616" /> principally through official development assistance, which in the case of Ireland is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Assistance to developing countries will also be provided under the conventions signed at UNCED; the contribution to the climate change fund will be met from my Department's Vote.</P>

Could he elaborate on the Government's plans to conserve energy, especially in public buildings and in private commercial and domestic buildings?

In view of that, will the Minister also agree that our Government have done nothing in their efforts to stop the building of Sellafield II?  Indeed, they have positively encouraged its building as the Taoiseach in 1990 agreed to an increase in the amount of EC funding when he was Minister for Finance and President of the Council of Ministers for Finance, which will have damaging consequences for our environment, particularly for the Irish Sea and for those who live on that coastline.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any proposals in conjunction with local authorities throughout the country with particular reference to municipal authorities to introduce a standard parking disc or ticket nationally that can be interchangeable for motorists parking anywhere in the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Col N="619" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Parking disc systems operate under traffic and parking by-laws made under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, by the Garda Commissioner, following consultation with local authorities and with the consent of the Minister for the Environment.  Separate by-laws apply in each local authority area and the level of charge in each case is determined by the local authority on the basis of relevant local considerations.</P>
      <P>The introduction of an amendment to the by-laws to introduce a standard parking disc system is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the first instance.  While any change of this nature would be convenient for motorists, full account would also have to be taken of the impact on local revenues and local discretion, and on the effectiveness of parking controls in different areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is no inter-change when a motorist moves from one municipal authority's jurisdiction to another in relation to parking discs?  This adds greatly to the problems of commercial representatives and tourists; if someone buys a book of tickets in Cork it would make sense to be able to use it in Waterford, Enniscorthy, Dublin or any city.  When the Minister attends the annual conference of municipal authorities, will he announce proposals to have an inter-exchangeability of such tickets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There certainly is an attraction in the idea of a national disc system. However, we are now endeavouring to move further down the road of allowing local authorities further discretion in their actions in areas like this.  It is primarily a matter for the Garda Commissioner and one could visualise circumstances in which small local authorities would lose out in favour of larger authorities.  There is room for improvement and, to the extent that I can have discussions with municipal authorities about matters like this, I undertake to do so.  However, in the final analysis, it is very much a matter for local consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister and I ask him to reconsider this matter.  It is a question of local authority revenue and as revenues are directly inter-linked with those of the Minister's Department, it should be possible to have some inter-exchangeability.  Will he at least ensure that where there are four or five different discs in the same county &mdash; where there are different town councils &mdash; one ticket will be valid in each jurisdiction?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which in effect is implementing the social housing scheme of 1991.  The scheme has much to recommend it.  It is innovative and covers a wide range from shared ownership and rental subsidy to improvements to private houses, voluntary housing schemes for the elderly, block loans to co-operatives, provision of sites and repairs to existing dwellings.  It is in line with the thinking of both officials and elected members.  Everyone will agree it is long past time there was a real look at the housing programmes for a number of reasons, principally because it has become increasingly more difficult for a person to erect his own home if he is on a low income.  Shared ownership is an opportunity for low wage earners to secure a home of their own.  It will give many persons in the lower income bracket an opportunity of eventually owning their own house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, much care must be taken that such a scheme would not over-generate competition, and it could very well inflate house prices.  The Minister spoke of 1,700 applications up to 31 March with <Col N="802" /> 600 approvals.  That in itself is evidence of the success of the scheme and gives the lie to the arguments emanating from some quarters opposing it.  It is a new concept which if properly used would be a break through for many persons who otherwise would never be in a position to own their own homes.</P>
    <P>Down the years in my local authority I have recommended shared ownership in instances where persons who had local authority loans found themselves in arrears and faced repossession of their houses by the local authority.  Shared ownership in such situations would be very effective.  It could mean that a person who had built his own house and was unable to meet his commitments, maybe because of loss of job, or for health or other reasons, could continue to live in it on a shared ownership basis.</P>
    <P>If you examine the housing programmes in any county you will realise the cost of the provision of houses.  In my county we have a current housing stock of 930 houses, 575 of which are on the purchase scheme and 355 are rented dwellings.  That is along with the housing stock of four urban councils.  The average weekly rent for the 375 houses is £9.28 and revenue of £144,000 accrues from that.  Over 40 per cent of that £144,000 goes to maintenance and that is for only minor repairs; it does not provide for major repairs to the dwellings.  That gives an indication of the problems facing councils and the importance of offloading those houses if possible even at a low price.  I was much in favour of the 1988 scheme but, unfortunately, it took the best houses off the market and left the local authorities with some houses 20 years old and more with the additional maintenance involved.</P>
    <P>Many grants for housing have been withdrawn.  A recent study we carried out in the county indicates that of approximately 13,000 dwellings, 1,700 are still without sanitary services.  I say to the Minister that in that area alone some type of assistance is worth considering.  Other parts of the country have a still higher percentage of houses without sanitary services.  In most rural areas people <Col N="803" /> depend on group water schemes of which there is a large number in my county. Practically half the population are served by those schemes.  The other half, in the urban areas, are serviced by local authority schemes.  If most of those groups want to keep within EC regulations they will have to have Phase II which requires treatment plants, and many of them have now reached that stage.  There is an emphasis on the INTERREG and other EC schemes to provide funding for sewerage plants.  I do not disagree with that because it is important that we get those sewerage plants if we want to have our waterways and our catchments pollution free, but I hope funding will be made available for a continuance of the development of those schemes through the second phase.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that it is not Government policy to build large housing estates on green field sites or on the periphery of cities and towns.  I support this policy.  Some years ago approximately 200 houses were built by the NBA on a sloped site on the outskirts of Monaghan town.  While this housing scheme which, I think, is based on a European concept may have been regarded as an architect's dream at the time it has turned out to be a tenant's nightmare because a stream in front of the estate was not piped&mdash;it was decided instead to stoneface the sides of the river. This river is now regarded as a health hazard and a danger.  The urban council do not have the necessary finance to rectify this problem.  So far as I am aware no section of the Department make contributions for this work.  In cases where serious errors are made in the initial stages of site planning the necessary funding should be provided to prevent the deterioration of estates and the access roads to them.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem with which local authorities have to deal in the provision of housing is the ebb and flow in the level of emigration.  As a result of the substantial building programmes carried out during the eighties, the numbers on the local authority waiting lists were substantially <Col N="804" /> reduced and very few people were urgently in need of housing.  I know a young couple who got a local authority house two months after they got married. As a councillor I never thought I would see the day when that could happen. Many of our emigrants are now returning home because of recession in the United States and Great Britain.  As a result the demand for local authority housing has substantially increased.  Some returning emigrants have savings and are able to buy properties of their own but unfortunately many others have very little savings and require housing and other forms of assistance.  It is very difficult for local authorities to plan housing programmes under which houses are available on demand.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that assistance may be given by housing authorities to certain bodies.  I believe many voluntary bodies could avail of this assistance to provide dwellings for old age pensioners.  There is a great demand by pensioners for such housing.  It is also more convenient for district health nurses to call to such dwellings. I hope voluntary bodies will avail of the assistance which may be given by housing authorities under this section.</P>
    <P>Many houses in towns and villages are in a very poor state of repair.  While it may be possible to refurbish some of them many more should be demolished. As a nation we tend to waste much of our good agricultural land by building on green field sites.  More consideration should be given to the demolition of old houses and to rebuilding on the same sites.</P>
    <P>Recently I heard that people were objecting to psychiatric patients being accommodated in housing estates in, I think, the midlands.  I was very concerned at this report because the scheme of relocating psychiatric patients in towns and villages in County Monaghan has been very successful.  These patients who live on their own and who are supervised by the auxillary nurse in the area have intermingled very well with the local community.  Great work has been done in this area.  In view of the experience of this scheme in my area I do not believe <Col N="805" /> there are grounds for the fears that have been expressed.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that housing authorities can make block loans available to housing co-operatives to purchase sites. This is a very important provision as the price of sites in most areas at present is at a premium.  The cost of building on sites where there is no ESB or sewerage connection and no piped water can be very high.  In addition very strict antipollution regulations have to be complied with.  Some years ago I asked the director of the co-operative building agency in my area to attend a local authority meeting. I was very surprised to learn that the takeup of the housing incentives by co-operatives in the northern part of the country was very low compared with the takeup by co-operatives in the south.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to housing aid for the elderly.  I ask the Minister to ensure that adequate funding is provided in future to health boards so that this work which is mainly done by FÁS, can continue to be carried out.  Under this scheme, which has operated very well, refurbishment work, draught proofing, etc. is carried out for old people who do not have any savings.  In other cases where the house owners have funding they purchase the materials and have the work carried out.  This scheme operates very well and is great value for money.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned serviced sites which are ideal for planned development. Unfortunately serviced sites in country areas have not been very attractive to house builders but in towns there has been a reasonable demand for them. With the scarcity of sites and the restriction on building in rural areas, especially in hilly areas, it is important that sites be serviced as this will ensure greater development and will be economical. Unfortunately, this is not being done on as great a scale as we would wish.  Section 11 of the Bill provides for the granting of loans to purchase sites and I hope there will be a substantial take-up in this regard.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place on occasions regarding the 1988 Act which legislates for the homeless.  At present <Col N="806" /> the number of people parking caravans alongside our national and national secondary routes is causing a serious problem for local authorities, of one of which I am a member.  Money has been provided in my county for halting sites but the real problem is in obtaining sites. There seems to be a continual increase in the number of people moving around in caravans, many of them traders selling electrical goods, floor coverings and gates, and others tarmacadam contractors. These people cause serious accidents and create problems for local landowners.  I do not know how this problem can be solved but money should be provided to secure sites and provide amenities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which has a number of commendable aspects.  If it is used in the best possible way it will improve greatly the position of many people who seek local authority assistance in the provision of housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>To address this Bill positively one must at the outset recognise that a housing crisis exists.  The housing crisis is now becoming a major social evil. Under the Housing Act, 1988, a national survey was carried out which found that 19,400 families were waiting to be housed nationally &mdash; we must ask what is the position now.  This figure did not include homeless persons who did not seek local authority housing.  A further survey was carried out in March 1991 in the Dublin Corporation area which showed that 4,377 families were in need of local authority housing; that there were 1,201 single person households and 3,970 family households.  The same survey showed that 918 persons were on the homeless list.  That contrasts with the June 1989 figure of 582, representing an 80 per cent increase in homelessness in one local authority area alone.  The total number of local authority houses built nationally in 1983 was 6,190 and in 1990 the figure was 1,003 houses.  For instance, in 1983 Dublin Corporation built 1,753 houses and only 35 in 1990, while Dublin County Council completed only 45 <Col N="807" /> houses in that year.  This is a national disgrace.</P>
      <P>In my area, the new Dublin Fingal area, the problem has reached crisis proportions. The area stretches from Balbriggan to Howth and includes such built-up areas as Skerries, Swords, Malahide, Howth and Baldoyle as well as parts of Ballymun and Santry.  In this area alone there are 682 urgent cases.  Most families reside at present with their parents, causing serious overcrowding, or reside in rented accommodation and most have been married within the last two or three years.  Overcrowding places an intolerable burden on families.  In most of these families there is a high rate of unemployment and the people see no way out of their predicament.  They readily tell us that Governments and local authorities generally have let them down.</P>
      <P>This is one of the major factors contributing to emigration.  People who come to my advice centres tell me that if they emigrate to England the men will readily get a job and they have a chance of getting a house there.  Deputy Leonard referred to the number of people returning to Ireland but people are leaving my constituency because they cannot get a house.  When they go to London they find they are housed quicker and have a better family life.  They are also better looked after on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated cost of providing for the needs of those awaiting housing in the Fingal area of Dublin is in excess of £25 million.  This figure has been given by the county manager and I am sure it is an accurate figure.  It is not a great amount of money and if it was made available it would solve many of the problems in my area.  To illustrate the point even further, in 1983 Dublin Corporation completed 1,753 houses; in 1984, 1,717 houses; and in 1985, 1,358 houses.  Since this Government have taken office the number of houses completed has dropped to 33 in 1989, 35 in 1990 and 34 in 1991.  People on the housing list achieve points for overcrowding and so on, but that is not good enough.  I know people with 80 or 90 points but who cannot get a house <Col N="808" /> from Dublin Corporation.  In order to get a house they would need overall priority but, as a person who served on Dublin Corporation, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know that to get overall priority a person would have to have a serious health problem or be a battered wife.</P>
    <P>I commend Women's Aid who look after battered wives and get housing for them.  The reason these people get overall priority is that they are in Women's Aid.  That organisation do excellent work and again I compliment them.  Their counsellors spend much time with the officials of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council and are successful in their efforts to have their personnel housed.  However, because these people get priority, which they deserve, there are no houses for people living in overcrowded conditions.  Overcrowding in two and three bedroom houses in Dublin is leading to marriage breakdown. If appropriate housing were available families would be much happier and there would be fewer marriages breaking down.  It is the duty of the Government, and local authorities, to provide adequate shelter for people.  It would relieve the terrible tension that exists in overcrowded homes.  Irish people like to own their own homes and like privacy and a front and back garden.  The provision of this type of accommodation is a great support for families.</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme we are trying to get people to provide their own houses.  I appreciate and support that aim but our unemployment problem makes it impossible for people on social welfare to avail of the new shared ownership scheme because they would not be able to afford the repayments.  Families are smaller and in the future pressure on housing will not be as great.  We should legislate to ensure that smaller families can be housed in the future.  In planning housing needs, we should constantly monitor the size of families.</P>
    <P>My constituency is divided between Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation. The county council have designed beautiful estates over the years, for instance New Grove Estate in <Col N="809" /> Donaghmede, a lovely bungalow design estate which is well laid out with many open spaces.  At the same time the designs of corporation estates is as they were 30 to 40 years ago, concrete jungles, ribbon belt development, house after house, road after road.  We should get away from that and concentrate on building small housing estates with nice open spaces.</P>
    <P>Although there is a housing crisis I do not suggest that we should return to the guaranteed order scheme that we had in 1973 or 1974, when we built such places as Seagrange estate in Baldoyle.  That is now an excellent development but the houses were built cheaply without a proper roof.  It took from 1974 to the middle eighties to impress on Government, and local authorities, that without proper roofing there would not be proper heating.  People in those houses worried constantly about the deterioration of the roofs.  Eventually the residents association and local representatives got together to ensure that new roofs were put on those houses.  It is now an excellent estate and the people there are very happy.  However, it took the residents a long time to get proper housing.</P>
    <P>We should consider Darndale, where we are refurbishing at a very slow pace. At the present rate of progress it would take another ten to 12 years before Darndale estate is refurbished.  That is not good enough.  The people there are trying to form a good community and to do so they need adequate housing which is properly insulated.  I compliment the Department on the refurbishment work carried out so far.  It is excellent, but the pace is too slow.  More money should be put into this work.  The refurbishment work will mean that we can house more families and reduce the housing lists, so it should be given priority.</P>
    <P>The Swans Nest Court area, a flat complex in my constituency is in need of refurbishment.  I raised this with the Department and in the House over the years.  There are about 100 flats in the complex and of late there have been many complaints that the condition of the roof is deteriorating and starting to <Col N="810" /> leak.  That does not help the quality of life there and people are worried about it. The Minister should make more money available to repair the Darndale and the other flat complex.  I am sure that Ballymun also could do with more money for refurbishment.  Will the Minister take on board the need to provide money for refurbishment, and let us get on with the programme?</P>
    <P>To solve the housing crisis, local authority house building must restart but I would not like to see the building of local authority estates on the scale of the mid-eighties, often on large greenfield sites on the periphery of urban areas.  We should have proper planning.  I do not want the Minister to develop the concrete jungles we had hereofore.</P>
    <P>I know Dublin County Council have the designated site scheme.  Many houses built over the years have large back or side gardens and owners should be encouraged to consider building a house for a member of the family on them under this scheme.  People should be informed that they can do this under this excellent scheme.  This scheme would help reduce the housing list.</P>
    <P>I notice that houses which were built in Howth, for instance, for £500 or £600 are now fetching £50,000 on the open market.  This enables people to move on to better housing or to buy two houses to accommodate a member of the family.  I do not suggest that we go back to the days when we used to claw back a certain percentage of the purchase price but a sales schemes should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Many houses in my constituency have up to half an acre of ground surrounding them.  We should encourage people to build an extra room to house a young family.  It creates a good mix in society to have parents, perhaps looking forward to retirement, their children and their grandchildren living in the same dwelling. We should provide enough money for adding rooms to houses to accommodate young families.  In many housing estates, I notice that in addition to having large gardens, there are large tracts of land behind the gardens.  There are examples of this in Howth.  We are very <Col N="811" /> anxious to encourage the fishing tradition in the village.  Fishing follows from father to son, however if the younger generation are not housed in the area, the tradition will die out.</P>
    <P>Nowdays, fishing is a different skill. You must leave home at 4 a.m. to get out to the fishing grounds and it is very late before you get home.  Therefore it is important to live nearby.  The council should encourage the building of a second house when the back garden can accommodate it.  Indeed, Dublin County Council bought some land in the area and I asked the county manager to give priority to local people, especially those involved in fishing.  I am sure there are other villages like Howth which have a tradition in a particular field, perhaps weaving, where it is desirable to retain the local population but no points or priority scheme seems to cater for such persons and they must find accommodation elsewhere.  That is a pity because the traditions that we cherish will just die away.</P>
    <P>The council intend to build 14 or 15 houses in the Howth area and I asked the manager to consider allocating them to locals.  However councillors being as they are look to their own constituency and indeed councillors from Balbriggan or Malahide would like to see their constituents housed in Howth and they kicked up a row about my suggestion and it was not accepted.  Perhaps the Minister could help in this regard by perhaps adding a rider to any provision of money that people who follow the traditional occupations should be enabled to stay in the area.</P>
    <P>Finding the deposit for a house puts a great burden on many people.  At present the maximum loan available from a local authority is £25,000 &mdash; and this special category loan is paid back at approximately £256 per month over a 25 year period.  This puts a burden on any family. The Minister should look at options such as exempting persons from stamp duty and providing grants towards the solicitor's fees.  Indeed £25,000 will not go very far when you are buying a house, <Col N="812" /> and in my area the cheapest house you will find costs more than £40,000.  We should consider raising the maximum loan to a figure nearer to the cost of a house.  Under the shared ownership scheme, the loan ceiling is £40,000, but it is very hard to find a house that costs £40,000.  Indeed at present you will not find a good house for £40,000 unless the vendor is opting for a quick sale.  More money must be made available for housing.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the general lack of housing.  Some private and local authority estates are overcrowded and very badly designed, and this leads to vandalism. When some estates were built, there was provision for access through a back laneway.  While the intention behind this was good &mdash; to allow easy access to buses and other modes of transport &mdash; they are now used by young people who congregate and hold drinking sessions, thus creating general mayhem. The gardaí in my area are constantly patrolling housing estates because the vandalism is very worrying.  The young people seem to be able to get their hands on unlimited quantities of drink and drugs and are causing serious problems to local residents, especially elderly people, who are afraid in their own homes.  I would like to see the Minister introducing steps as early as possible to have these laneways closed up easily.  At present it takes at least a year to have this done, even when every resident in the estate agrees to it because the matter has to be dealt with through the planning process. Legislation is needed so that these laneways can be closed off quickly.</P>
    <P>Recently in a planning application for 40 or so houses in Baldoyle, which is part of my area, I noticed that it was proposed to leave a laneway to allow residents access to the nearby DART station.  I could appreciate the planner's point of view because this would encourage people to leave their cars at home and use the DART instead.  However I had to object to this proposal at council level as did other local residents and we were successful in objecting to the proposed laneway.  People were very worried that <Col N="813" /> young people would congregate in the laneway and cause mayhem in the estate. I recently visited a housing estate in Grange Abbey where young people have pulled down the side wall of a house which is just across the road from the laneway.  Indeed one man who parks his buses in the laneway constantly finds that the windows are broken.  We should introduce legislation providing a procedure to close off such laneways quickly.</P>
    <P>While I like to see plenty of open space in housing estates, the local authority should be required to patrol those open spaces in order to prevent young people creating havoc by drinking in the open air.  Because of the manpower shortage in the Howth Garda station, the Garda tell me they are unable to patrol these areas and they do not have sufficient staff to put a man on the beat.  Indeed they also say that if they get rid of the problem in one area they are merely exporting it to another estate where the problem recurs.  Again I appeal to the Minister to empower the local authorities to implement procedures to close off laneways quickly.</P>
    <P>In my constituency Dublin Corporation have provided houses in the county council area, and I, as a county councillor, cannot take up with the corporation their problems with rent arrears, maintenance or indeed requests for transfers.  I know it is proposed to reform local government but the Department should examine this problem and consider transferring the ownership of these houses to the local authority in whose area they are located and who would then arrange to collect the rents. This problem is prevalent in a number of constituencies and we are unable to deal with it for the corporation tenants because we are not elected to the corporation.</P>
    <P>The shared ownership scheme looks enticing and should work.  A few points should be considered in order to make the scheme efficient.  The law agents' offices in both Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation are dealing with a huge volume of work and cannot process <Col N="814" /> documents quickly enough.  People know this problem exists and that it may take a long time to establish title.  Extra personnel should be appointed to process the documentation and to establish title more quickly.  If that does not happen sellers will not be anxious to deal with people who are in a shared ownership scheme.  An estate agent told me recently that he would be more likely to encourage a sale to a person getting a building society loan rather than somebody in a shared ownership scheme because in the latter case the sale could be held up for some time.  A person selling a house should be confident that a sale will be closed very quickly.  Estate agents and solicitors should also have that confidence. It would require extra money to provide more staff in local authorities but this is necessary to ensure that the scheme is a success.</P>
    <P>I would encourage the Minister to consider joint venture schemes.  At an area in my constituency, called Hole in the Wall, near Donaghmede, it is proposed to build 900 houses.  The proposer tells me that the houses will cost in the region of £40,000 to £45,000.  I think he is aiming towards the joint ownership scheme.  We should talk to people who have planning permission of this kind to see if joint ventures can be organised with a local authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard said it was a disgrace that there should be any houses without sewerage facilities.  The Minister met a deputation from the Hole in the Wall area where there are 35 houses without sewerage.  The new development will commence shortly and we must ensure that these people get proper sewerage facilities while the development is going on.  I thank the Minister for meeting that group.  They were quite satisfied but they are looking for action.  They want the Government to provide the money for sewerage to these houses which are six or seven miles from the centre of the city. Sometimes people do not believe that there is a sewerage problem on the outskirts of Dublin.  The Minister might discuss with the proposer of this development the making available of a <Col N="815" /> sewerage scheme to the residents of St. Michael's Cottages in Hole in the Wall.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to what I would regard as a waste of money.  I cite the case of one of my constituents who was living with his wife and child in the home of his wife's parents.  It was a small cottage which the health board decided was unfit and they issued an order accordingly.  The man duly reported to the health authority who told him they would give him a subsidy towards the rent of a house.  He consulted several auctioneers and estate agents and found it difficult to find a house to rent. Most estate agents told him he would need a deposit, in one case a deposit of £600, the rent being £400 a month.  The only place he could get a house was in one of the best estates in the area.  He paid £600 in deposit, most of which was provided by the health board.  He is paying just £400 a month in rent, with a subsidy of almost two thirds provided by the health board.  To me that is a waste of taxpayers' money and it is wrong.  He has one of the best houses in the area. More power to him if he can get it; it was the only house he could get.  There are other cases like this.  It would be better to recognise that there is a housing crisis and put the money to better use by building houses rather than wasting it in this fashion.  The Minister might address this problem.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council and most of the local authorities insist on the highest standards in building construction, with proper regard for energy conservation and proper insulation.  Proper attic insulation and double glazing should be required in all new houses.  Grants for such insulation would be money well spent.  It could save about £50 million a year in oil imports, according to a recent report.</P>
    <P>We have been reading lately about water shortages in the Dublin area.  Due to very dry weather conditions reservoirs have run down.  A programme should be initiated by the Department or by the local authorities to enlist the co-operation of people in water saving. <Col N="816" /> Manufacturers of water cisterns should be asked to introduce a smaller cistern which would save 50 per cent of water when flushing.  More research would result in measures to save water in Dublin city.  At times in the Baldoyle and Howth areas the water supply is throttled or turned off, giving people either reduced supply or none at all.  We should encourage the manufacture of various water saving devices.</P>
    <P>The north Dublin drainage scheme serves most of the housing estates from Finglas to Howth.  One pipe takes in waste from houses, hospitals and factories and emits raw sewage at Howth Head.  The EC have directed that we should install proper treatment works before 1998 or 1999.  The north Dublin drainage scheme will have to be treated very shortly.  Consultants have been appointed to recommend on the siting of a sewage treatment works and I understand they are looking at three locations. They tell us that the treatment works cannot be more than a mile away from the pipe.  One of the sites they are considering is in St. Anne's Estate and another is a land-fill site in the Howth area. We reckon it is near the Baldoyle race-course or somewhere between Baldoyle and Portmarnock.  A sewage treatment works is like an itinerant site: nobody wants it near them.  The Baldoyle, Howth-Sutton area and all that area along the coast is a high amenity area. We would be totally opposed to the siting of a sewage treatment works in any of those areas.  We have fought long and hard to preserve the open spaces in Baldoyle. We have fought off several planning applications down through the years and we will continue to do so.  I want to put the Minister on notice today that we are not in favour of the treatment works being located in the Baldoyle or Howth-Sutton area.</P>
    <P>There is a solution.  We had a meeting recently with the consultants organised by the Howth-Sutton 2,000 group &mdash; an excellent group in that area who look after the environment &mdash; and they told us there is a solution.  I have praised the group several times in this House and will <Col N="817" /> continue to do so.  The solution is quite simple.  One can run a pipe from the North Dublin drainage scheme across to the Ringsend works.  I understand that in time that will be a proper treatment works which will emit clean water into the receding waters in Dublin Bay.  We in the Baldoyle, Howth-Sutton area are totally opposed to the sewage treatment plant being located in our area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the matter of housing.  We have high amenity areas such as the Redrock site on which people are seeking to build houses.  The answer to our problem in trying to preserve these areas is a special amenity area order.  That is troublesome and it is very difficult to process through the council.  I understand the Liffey Valley area amenity order was initiated by the Department of the Environment.  We should look to that Department to preserve these spaces from house building. Howth needs a special amenity area order.  These areas are being preserved at present by doing deals with people who want to develop these areas.  For instance, we are saying to them in regard to Redrock mark II &mdash; as I call it, the second site beside Redrock &mdash; you can have two houses if you give us 40 acres. That is the wrong approach, it is piece-meal, it is not good and it is not fair to either side.  In order to preserve these areas near housing estates the Minister and his Department should make a special amenity area order.</P>

      <P>Legislation relating to the provision of housing and housing development is a very important subject for debate at any time in this House and is something that engages practically every Member.  That is understandable because housing is one of the most fundamental rights of any individual or family.  Much had been expected from this legislation but it is not adequate, in the present circumstances, of allowing anything like the colossal housing needs of the community to be met.  While the timesharing proposal has some attractions, when one peruses the applications for local authority housing in any part of the country, <Col N="818" /> one finds that the income levels of the overwhelming majority are related to the social welfare levels.  This in itself is a total barrier to participating in the shared ownership scheme.  The lack of local authority housing and Government investment in this area since 1988 has resulted in a crisis situation.  There is no commitment by the Government to seriously address the housing crisis that has existed since then.  Every Member of this House and every member of every urban council, county council and corporation know the magnititude of the problem.  All such bodies are sitting on a timebomb because of the number of families and others who have been awaiting rehousing since 1989.  The failure of this Bill to give any reasonable hope to the majority of those on the housing lists could be the spark which may well set that timebomb alight and bring people onto the streets to protest. It is most frustrating for public representatives week after week to meet people who are awaiting rehousing and to be unable to give them any hope as to when they may be rehoused.</P>
      <P>In my own urban council area currently there are 95 certified applicants for rehousing.  All the council and the housing manager have at this time and will have for 12 months hence is 14 houses to meet the housing needs of those 95 families, some of whom live in mobile homes, some in caravans and some in high cost rented accommodation.  As I said at the outset the tragedy is that the overwhelming majority of those seeking rehousing today are social welfare recipients. If the Minister or anybody else were to tell a family in need of housing that they could not be taken out of their misery because of the Government's fiscal policy, they would hardly accept such explanation.  This is a real problem for public representatives in trying to allay the frustration of those people. Investment in housing is of national advantage.  Not only does it create employment but it also gives a family the dignity, and entitlement of having a proper house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in introducing a tenant purchase <Col N="819" /> scheme is a disappointment, especially for tenants who have been inquiring of public representatives as to when such a scheme would be introduced. I note that the Minister recently announced outside this House that such a scheme would be introduced at an early date.  Certainly many local authority tenants would welcome that because the state of local authority finances is such that the level of maintenance has had to be cut back.  Many tenants who are carrying out the necessary repairs are most anxious to own the houses they live in so that they can be sure of their investment in them.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one important point in the hope that the Minister will be able to meet the objectives to which I refer.  I would ask the Minister to investigate the position of aged people who have vested their cottages for a number of years and where the income to the family reduces substantially through the death of either the husband or the wife. In such circumstances the remaining partner is under very severe financial pressure to keep up the mortgage repayments. In many such cases they are protected through the insurance policy but the case I make is for people not so protected.  As of now the only freedom the housing manager has in such cases is to have the house taken back and the person transferred from mortgage repayments to rent.  I request that under the provisions of this legislation housing managers be given the necessary authority to explore other means of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that in the case of pensioners who have been proud to own their own home for a number of years and then faced severe financial difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments following the loss of a spouse the manager should be given the power under legislation to find a way that would be more acceptable and more beneficial to both the local authority and the Department.  The Government cannot and must not evade their responsibility to provide houses for those who are <Col N="820" /> in absolute need and who cannot from their own resources ever hope to provide themselves with the security of a proper home.  Throughout the country there are people in need.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that will allow tenants and local people to become involved in the maintenance and management of local authority housing estates.  In the past the level of communication between local authorities and tenants left much to be desired.  The development is an excellent one which is taking root throughout the country. Housing groups are coming together in consultation with officers of local authorities to design and maintain open areas. Provision is being made for amenities and leisure facilities for children on the estates.  A general discussion is taking place about proper structures and repairs.  In the long run, this development will prove to be a most satisfactory scheme financially and will be of benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>Two other matters of concern to local authority representatives are the complete cut off of moneys for essential repairs and the lack of grants for the provision of accommodation for disabled persons.</P>
    <P>The essential repairs scheme in the main related to old age pensioners and disabled people living alone.  The scheme was designed to repair doors, windows and roofs and to keep the fabric of a structure together and in a reasonably habitable condition.  The scheme has been practically stopped in my county at least and some houses that would have benefited from it will become uninhabitable and their occupants will further add to the housing lists.  The seeming discontinuation of the scheme is an undesirable development, and I ask the Minister to take note of that.</P>
    <P>Another very valuable scheme that has fallen into financial difficulty is the disabled person's grant.  The scheme primarily related to two-storey buildings in which a disabled person was so incapacitated as to be unable to use a stairway and was, therefore, denied the use of toilet and bathroom facilities.  Under the <Col N="821" /> scheme a contribution from the family of the house was expected towards the provision of a separate bedroom, with a toilet and shower if possible.  It was an excellent solution to a serious problem. Without the help of this scheme disabled people who cannot provide those facilities themselves and have no access to toilet and bathroom facilities may have to go to an institution.  Such a result would only mean more Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to carefully scrutinise with each local authority housing manager the element of need for both the essential repairs scheme and the disabled person's grant scheme.  For relatively small expenditure those schemes played a major role in retaining the fabric of houses in a habitable condition and in allowing an aged or disabled person to remain within the family home.</P>
    <P>Every housing authority and housing manager must be concerned about the number of unmarried mothers who are on the housing lists.  Consideration should be given to the suggestion of assisting in the provision of a separate room cum kitchen to be built on to the family home.  While that suggestion may not be practical in all cases, it could in many instances meet the requirement and, possibly, help in the stability of families. Many unmarried mothers are resorting to living in caravans, mobile homes and rented accommodation.  Local authorities often have to provide expensive accommodation for two people.</P>
    <P>There is a pressing need to find a solution for the major social problems presented by the volume of marital instability caused by a lack of housing.  Often when there is a break-up in a family living in a local authority house one spouse has to seek further housing, thereby adding to an already serious housing list.  The sooner we engage on a programme to clear the colossal backlog on the housing lists the sooner we will find solutions to the other social problems arising from the need for housing.  This is a national crisis and one on which action cannot be delayed because very serious social problems could result.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Moynihan, and other speakers from the Opposition benches who virtually unanimously expressed disappointment at the contents of the Bill.  We do not wish to be negative, we do not wish to be obstructive and we certainly do not wish to be dismissive, but one could justifiably describe this Bill, which was heralded for a long time, as an elaborate ado about nothing.  We could have all the Bills, measures, schemes and programmes in the world and the most elaborate and sophisticated framework, but without the necessary financial back-up and assistance all such plans, programmes and approaches are meaningless and count for nought.</P>
      <P>Since a Fianna Fáil Government took office in 1987 housing has slipped down the social agenda and priority list.  One could say that it has been almost completely pushed off the agenda.  This year the total being made available for local authority housing is £18.5 million.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to reply in a few moments.  According to the book of Estimates there will this year be a reduction of £2 million on what could be described as a disastrous provision for 1991.  The amount provided would build 600-plus&mdash; and it would be a very small &ldquo;plus&rdquo;&mdash; local authority houses.  The provision is certainly put into perspective when one considers that the two inspectors on the Greencore case received more money for their travails than the entire County Mayo, with its three urban councils and one county council, received for its 1992 housing programme.  With a housing list of 500, the Mayo County Council building programme this year provided for the building of a mere 25 houses.  The position is the same throughout the country, as has been pointed out by every Opposition Member who has spoken. The housing lists are getting longer by the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every local authority housing agency is in the middle of a major housing crisis, <Col N="823" /> as Deputy Moynihan said.  The problem is particularly acute in the City of Dublin. It is at crisis level and its association with crime has been very much understated judging by the comments by Dublin Deputies in the House.  Instead of reacting to the looming social and civic unrest which invariably arises from a national housing crisis, the Government have contented themselves with high-sounding, complicated, unfunded &mdash; or under-funded&mdash;new initiatives such as the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to build a legislative framework round the Government's document <i>A Plan for Social Housing,</i> as the memorandum states, &ldquo;published by the Minister for the Environment in February 1991&rdquo;.  To use the word &ldquo;published&rdquo; is underplaying the significance of what happened, as the word is a misnomer or a modest description of what occurred at the launching.  The then Minister &mdash; a fellow county man &mdash; called in the TV cameras, the national radio and newspapers for the launch of what was to be a major new initiative, a new, all-purpose document for housing, the panacea for all our ills.  However, if one contacts the housing officer in any local authority he will confirm that the plan for social housing is a sick joke.  The waiting lists have grown longer, the condition of local authority houses has deteriorated, the number of homeless has escalated &mdash; and is escalating further every day &mdash; and at the outset it was difficult to accept the bona fides of the Government's social plans for housing.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government, within a matter of weeks after assuming office in 1987, abolished the highly successful house improvement grant scheme but did not introduce a substitute.  The grants scheme introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government was prudently managed and, more than any previous scheme in this decade, updated the housing stock, particularly from the point of view of the lower and middle income private house owners who could, under the scheme, receive finance to reconstruct or renovate dilapidated houses.  It <Col N="824" /> helped to bring thousands of tradesmen out of the black economy into the open by virtue of the fact that they had registered for value-added tax.  The scheme put a buzz back into local economies by generating much welcome business activity for builders' providers, and by taking unemployed carpenters, plumbers, block layers and plasterers off the dole queue, thus greatly improving the quality of the housing stock by the erection of bathrooms and toilet facilities where previously there were none.  It also led to the erection of additional bedroom space and the provision of a water supply where previously none existed and the improvement of the fabric of houses generally.</P>
    <P>This Government, in the same year on assuming office, virtually abolished the SDA loans as we know them, whereby somebody earning up to £10,000 could get a loan of up to £21,000 at approximately 12.5 per cent repayable over 30 years.  This was an excellent scheme but the conditions attached to the new scheme meant that one had to hawk one's financial credentials to a bank, credit union or building society and be refused, not by one but by all these agencies, before one could be eligible for a county council loan.  It is safe to assume that the reason a person would be turned down for a bank or building society loan is that the bank or building society were not convinced of the applicant's creditworthiness. Therefore, the county council were expected to come in to pick up the slack.  It is ridiculous to impose a condition on a county council whereby they would give a loan to someone whose creditworthiness had not been approved by a bank or building society.  As was said on the other side of the House, this Government have caused the disabled person's reconstruction grant scheme and the essential repairs grant scheme&mdash; which were operated so effectively and judiciously by the local authorities over the years &mdash; to grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for extending the Housing Acts, 1966 and 1988, and introduces a number of innovations, which are fine provided you allocate the necessary <Col N="825" /> finance and complement them with the resources to back them up.  One of the much vaunted features of the Bill is the provision of a statutory basis for shared ownership, a scheme whereby the occupier is enabled to purchase a portion of the House and to pay the balance by way of regular repayments over a period of between 20 and 100 years.  I will give an example of the irrelevance of the scheme to reality.  In County Mayo there is normally a high take-up of new schemes and innovations whether by way of loans, joint ventures or tenant purchase schemes.  Since the scheme was introduced in County Mayo only one person has availed of it.  The period is too long, the scheme is too complicated and is much too unattractive to the normal house purchaser.  Apart from that, the money has not been made available to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>When I asked parliamentary questions, written or oral, in relation to the new low interest rate scheme for housing and the allocation to Mayo County Council I was told that the total allocation to the council is £900,000 to cover all the new programmes envisaged in this scheme &mdash; loans, a capital programme, essential repairs grants and disabled persons' reconstruction grants.  Local authorities are given the cake and it is up to each one to slice it in the number of ways it thinks fit.  However, if the cake is not large enough there simply are not enough slices to go round; unfortunately, that is the key failing in the social housing programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general thrust of section 5 which provides that a local authority can carry out works to improve, extend or to adapt a house not owned by the authority &mdash; again it is a way of addressing the crisis.  Various options in relation to the recovery of the expenditure are put in place and fundamentally it is a good idea.  It uses existing housing resources and stock to provide additional housing capacity but, unfortunately, the money has not been made available to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill for the establishment of management associations <Col N="826" /> by residents to manage, as far as possible, housing estates and schemes. The more residents become involved in the control of their own affairs and the more participation there is at management level, the more one devolves power to the people themselves and the greater the sense of pride and responsibility. It is amazing to see the contrast in the upkeep of estates; often a relatively new estate falls into disrepair within a very short period and yet another very similar estate, built at the same time and to the same design and standards, is kept to the highest possible standard, indeed very often it is improved and enhanced compared to the condition in which it was handed over by the builder to the local authority.  Invariably, one finds that estates which have active tenants' associations are the best performers.  Each housing scheme, from its inception, should put in place a local tenants' association, or indeed a management association, as specified in this section, which would enable people to exercise their democratic powers of electing representatives to participate in decisions affecting their collective welfare and generally to be collectively responsible for the presentation, preservation and appearance of their areas.</P>
    <P>One of the crippling costs on local authorities, as any county manager or local authority member will testify, is that of housing maintenance and repairs.  The concept of tenant purchase schemes and the selling of houses to local authority tenants is a good one in principle in that it gives ownership back to people &mdash; it is one of the great yearnings of every Irish person to own his or her own home&mdash; but the most saleable and modern and better kept houses were purchased by tenants while the more dilapidated and older houses remain in the ownership of the local authority.  Undoubtedly, difficulties sometimes arise due to poor quality construction or to the age of the building while in many cases the costs incurred by the local authority in repairing the housing stock arise from sheer neglect or indeed, vandalism by the tenants themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> I would have to agree that the rents charged by local authorities are reasonable and that people get good value for money.  However, if houses are to be kept in good repair every local authority without exception should insist that the local revenue collector carry out an inspection of each house in his area at least once ever two years and forward a short report on the condition of the house as a matter of form to the local authority. It is appalling that the green and grass areas in the general environment of local authority housing estates may be unkempt.  It should, therefore, be one of the objectives of local management committees and tenant associations to try to ensure that the public are conscious of the need to keep the general environment up to standard and that there is a sense of community pride.  Provision should be made in every housing scheme of over 25 houses for a common play area.</P>
    <P>Halting sites are mentioned in the Bill and have become a major bone of contention in many areas.  However, the general principle in relation to halting sites is a good one.  I have come across well managed halting sites in Castlerea, County Roscommon, and in Roscommon town itself but on the other hand I have come across disastrous halting sites such as the one on the outskirts of Longford town.  Unfortunately, we do not have any halting site in County Mayo.  There should be at least one halting site in every local authority area.  Without exception, every local authority should be given 12 months to provide a halting site because without a proper spread section 10 of the Bill will not work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general principle that any caravan parked within two miles of an established halting site should be towed away forthwith and that certain penalties should be imposed.  However, I would go further.  Communities are regularly invaded by convoys of up to 30 or 40 caravans at a time, which are parked on the roadside often for long periods in defiance of orders and injunctions issued by the courts or the county council.  This amounts to an intrusion on the rights of <Col N="828" /> settled communities.  I have no objection to a single caravan or indeed two to three caravans parking for short periods but particularly at this time of the year caravans are parked bumper to bumper very often on busy national primary and secondary roads.  As I said, this amounts to an unwarranted intrusion on the rights of the settled community apart altogether from being in many cases, a traffic hazard.  At present the local authorities seem to be powerless in dealing with the matter.  While the principle that people should use halting sites is a good one, the provision of a distance of two miles is too restrictive.</P>
    <P>The design of rural housing leaves a lot to be desired.  They have been designed in the same unimaginative way for the past 25 years and this does not do justice to our planners, architects and builders with a sense of innovation.  It is high time therefore that each local authority produced and submitted their own design to the Department of the Environment for approval to remove the stigma attached to a local authority house.</P>
    <P>Mortgage interest relief which is supposed to have been protected by Governments during the years has been whittled away in each successive budget through the use of an uncanny device, that is, the elimination of relief for endowment mortgages.  During the months of September, October and November in the lead-up to the budget we have the normal attack by certain economists on what are known as the traditional reliefs, VHI relief and mortgage interest relief. However, following the crescendo from the various defensive sectors the reliefs are either not dismantled in the budget or there is the minimum intrusion despite all the speculation &mdash; woe betide any Government who would touch either of those reliefs.</P>
    <P>There has however been an intrusion by stealth on another relief, that is, interest relief for endowment mortgages. In the most recent budget, following a series of deductions in previous budgets, interest relief on the life insurance element was eliminated.  As a result damage has been done to endowment <Col N="829" /> mortgages.  Indeed this is one of the reasons for the decrease in new house starts of 1 per cent in 1990 and 4 per cent in 1991.</P>
    <P>The Bill is fine in theory and amounts to a glorious social housing plan, but without money, resources and finance it will be meaningless.  I attended a meeting of the housing committee of a local authority yesterday evening when the complaints which those of us on the Opposition benches recite time and again were par for the course and we ended up in a whirlpool of frustration.  There are 500 people on the housing list; yet we do not have the money or the resources to build houses to meet our requirements. Unfortunately, there is no indication that additional finance will be provided.</P>
    <P>Let me make one final point in relation to social housing.  During the years we have failed to provide a livelihood for a huge number of people.  It is estimated that in the United States there are 40 million people of Irish origin while there are six million people in Great Britain who were born within these shores.  I am sure that anyone who has had the pleasure of addressing emigrant associations abroad &mdash; I am sure the Minister has addressed the Tipperary Association in various parts of London &mdash; will testify that it is one of the outstanding ambitions of many of those for whom we were not able to provide a livelihood here to return and spend their final years here.</P>
    <P>I am not referring to the people in cardboard city but the many people living in the inner cities of Birmingham, London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Leeds and Edinburgh who are now in recept of reasonably good retirement pensions from the DHSS or from various firms for whom they worked for 35 to 40 years after leaving these shores.  Many of these people would love to return here for their final years if we could provide them with decent low cost housing.  I know it is a bit much to ask that we provide housing for our emigrants given that we cannot provide it for the people living here at present, but it would make good economic sense as well as good social sense to look at the possibility of <Col N="830" /> rehabilitating some of these people here if they genuinely want to come back.</P>
    <P>If we were to bring back from the United Kingdom two people who are in receipt of DHSS pensions, which amount to approximately £150 per week &mdash; the average industrial wage here &mdash; this would put bread on the table for many a shopkeeper, publican, baker, draper and sales representative in a rural community. I honestly believe that we should consider our social policy with a view to rehabilitating some of our emigrants who have a desire to return here.  In deference to those living here at present who have not got a house they have to be our first priority, but one of the major defects in our economic performance is that we have not got a large domestic consumer population.  There are simply not sufficient people within our shores to consume what we produce.  Whether it be a returned DHSS recipient from Birmingham or London as long as he or she consumes here they are helping to create economic wealth.  A plan we might usefully examine from the point of view of our overall economy and our entitlements within Europe in the post-Maastricht Treaty period is whether it would be possible to negotiate with the European Community some type of rehabilitation, displacement or return package for the millions of our emigrants who would like to return to a reasonable standard-type house in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>This plan is great by way of a philosopher's dream, it is a planner's plan but, from the point of view of providing answers to the growing housing crisis, indeed its attendant potential social explosion, we will ignore that housing crisis at our peril.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me time to speak, not a regular facility available to me.</P>
      <P>I might first refer to some of the Minister's introductory remarks to which I listened with interest.  For example, he said he wanted to make clear that the social housing plan was intended to supplement rather than supplant the traditional local authority house-building programme.  I regret to say that I consider that to be a most dishonest statement on the Minister's part.  It is clear, within the context of the Minister's remarks and the almost total scrapping of the local authority house-building programme, that the Government's plan for social housing, in effect, is one to bring to an untimely end the great work of previous Governments in the provision of modern houses for families who could not afford homes of their own.</P>
      <P>The reality is that in Dublin the average number of local authority houses built annually prior to 1987 was 1,500. Over the past four years, in some years there was not one local authority house built and, in the past couple of years, there was an average of 50 built annually. Those figures speak for themselves. While £66 million was allocated in 1982 in Dublin city for local authority house-building, that figure has been reduced to approximately £6 million this year.</P>
      <P>It is equally dishonest to suggest that the social housing plan provides an alternative strategy to make accomodation available to persons and families in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> Any plan that does not, at the same time, allocate adequate funding cannot achieve its aims.  Clearly adequate resources are not being made available to local authorities. The all important question is whether the proposals envisaged provide for the needs of families on the Dublin Corporation housing list and for Dublin Corporation tenants living in substandard, overcrowded flats.  In Dublin city in excess of 80 per cent of Dublin Corporation's tenants rely on social welfare benefits solely for their livelihood. Indeed, the bulk of families and individuals on the Dublin Corporation housing list are social welfare recipients, as are the majority of families on the corporation's transfer list.  By and large they are people who benefit from the public house-building programme.  Will the Minister say where they are catered for in the Government plan because I contend the answer is &ldquo;nowhere&rdquo;.  The answer lies in the 50 local authority houses that may or may not be built in Dublin this year.  Those people flock to the Dublin Corporation housing offices daily in search of an ever diminishing number of vacancies and, in most areas, none at all.</P>
    <P>Local authorities need funds to purchase or build houses.  The Government are, and have been, starving local authorities of funds.  I must emphasise the importance of building one house in Dublin city which is not merely that it will house a family.  By and large, a family accommodated in a two-bedroom flat in a Dublin Corporation housing estate will transfer into a larger flat because of their overcrowded living conditions.  Then a family living in a one-bedroom flat in overcrowded conditions will transfer to the two-bedroom flat; two persons living in a one-room flat will transfer into a one-bedroomed flat and then a homeless person will usually be allocated the one room.  It can be seen from that that when one local authority house is built in effect it caters for the housing needs of four or five families.  Conversely, when one ceases to provide houses one exacerbates the already intolerable living conditions of many families.  Indeed, those intolerable <Col N="834" /> living conditions constitute one of the main factors leading to crime, drug dependency and a range of other social problems.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, is responsible for the spiralling drugs and crime problem since, in his period as Minister for the Environment, it was his Government's policy of urban neglect that led to the drugs and crime problems we now experience.  I do not blame the present Minister for the Environment.  He is simply implementing well established Government policy, to cease providing houses for families too poor to provide their own.  That policy is dictated by one consideration only, the high cost of providing such houses.  This policy, followed since 1987, has resulted in a severe housing crisis not only in the Dublin area but nationwide.  The Minister must be aware of the problem if only from the feed-back of his party's local councillors.  If he is not prepared to accept that he might visit Dublin Corporation's housing department to verify those facts.</P>
    <P>Any Member of this House who holds an advice centre in a poor area knows full well the extent of the housing crisis.  I trust they are honest enough to tell the unfortunate families who come looking for assistance to get a house or home of their own that it is Government policy to deny them that right.  However, perhaps there are many Members on the Government benches here who would be too ashamed to tell the people the truth on this issue.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, even the media do not see the issue as one of major social and moral priority, as we see from the empty media benches here today. Perhaps that is because it is not a middle class issue, it is one for the urban working class poor.  I will finish on this point in deference to the Minister, the House and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It must be an extreme irony that at the same time as the Government are talking about the high cost of local authority houses and have scrapped the local authority house building programme, there was a great upsurge in building the most expensive, exclusive houses and apartments.  Week after week there are property supplements like this one I have here from <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 14 May.  The headline refers to &ldquo;The season for half a million pound houses&rdquo;.  While we are here listening to a Government saying there is not enough money to house the poor in this city and the towns and cities around the country, the property supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> thinks there is nothing more important to highlight and draw our attention to than the £500,000 houses for the rich.  Where in Heaven's name, can we find a greater recipe for social conflict? We are beginning to see the start of that social conflict and its source is the present Government's policy.</P>
      <P>I have much more to say.  I had prepared quite a lengthy contribution on this issue which is very important in my constituency and Dublin city, but I regret I have to allow the other speakers in because of constraints of time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for your co-operation.  I want to try to explain to the Minister, given his relatively recent appointment and probably his lack of experience and understanding of living <Col N="836" /> in an urban capital like Dublin, and his probable unfamiliarity with Dublin Corporation housing estates and schemes, the tragic, disturbing and very difficult conditions under which many people are living in our public housing schemes. Also, I want to highlight for him the extreme frustration, annoyance, difficulty and overcrowding because of lack of a proper local authority house building programme.</P>
      <P>The plan for social housing as presented by the Minister can be accepted by those of us in the Democratic Left in so far as it attempts to bring in new concepts in public housing and in accommodating people.  New concepts are always welcome.  However, new concepts on their own are not going to make any impact on the disastrous housing crisis that exists in this city.  The missing point about this programme is that it cannot work on its own and needs to be complemented by a major capital housebuilding programme.</P>
      <P>In Dublin Corporation at present, in excess of 4,500 people are on the housing allocations list waiting desperately, in overcrowded conditions, for accommodation to be provided by the local authority.  In excess of 1,000 homeless families are living in our capital city.  Of course, we see homeless people living in cardboard boxes not 50 yards from where I am speaking.  There is a homelessness crisis in this city.  About 8,000 families are on a housing transfer list.  That is indicative of their frustration at living in an environment in which they are not happy and mainly they want to transfer from a local authority flat to some other complex, generally a housing complex. They are being frustrated because the corporation have not got a house building programme as the Minister's Department will not finance it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of the tragedy of the basic breakdown of law and order in estate management affecting many of our housing schemes?  For example, is he aware that about 400 squatters are occuping the limited accommodation available? 400 of the limited numbers of houses and flats have squatters in them <Col N="837" /> at the moment.  For the very first time in my experience as a public representative, the Eastern Health Board have a special homeless section where, because of the crisis in housing, people are diverted, to hostels which very often are full to overcrowding.  These people have to be turned away and end up in bed and breakfast accommodation because there is nowhere to house them.</P>
    <P>There is no confusion in my mind as to why this situation arises.  The stark statistics produced yearly by Dublin Corporation show there was a massive house building programme estimated to run, since we started building in 1932, at approximately 1,500 units, but suddenly in 1987 we were down to 446 units.  In 1988 we built only 148 units.  Lo and behold, to the very lasting shame of Fianna Fáil and the Coalition Government in 1989 we built no houses, not a single one.  In 1990 the proud record is 25 units built, possibly senior citizen accommodation but no family housing units.  The figures show that in 1991 only 74 units were built and in this year, 1992, 100 units have been built, of which 50 at least are to accommodate tenants of Sheriff Street flats which are being detenanted.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a crisis, and an extremely dangerous one, and I ask the Minister to address the question which he tries, to some degree, to address in his plan for social housing, that is the question of co-operative housing or housing associations.  There is an ideal opportunity, with proper funding, encouragement and organisation, for groups who might be interested in their own traditional co-operative, family housing schemes.  With proper encouragement and financial assistance housing co-operatives could be a real contributor to alleviating the housing crisis.  There is, of course, a need for a greater social mix, and that could be done effectively by using the desire of people to house themselves through housing co-operatives.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to pay very close attention to the breakdown in law and order in many of our housing estates and flat complexes.  This is due primarily to a <Col N="838" /> breakdown of estate management coupled with the always present squatters who are squatting more often than not now because no alternative accommodation is available.  Consider the intimidation, trouble and havoc being caused by these illegal occupiers, who know the system inside out, who know it is taking 12 months, and in excess of that, to be evicted; that if they vacate before the court order arrives they can squat in another flat or house and get 12 months free living there and move on again.  They have it off to a &ldquo;t&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to address as quickly as he can the massive legal delaying process local authorities are required to go through in this eviction procedure.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I compliment the Minister on the excellence of the refurbishment scheme as it applies to Oliver Bond flats.  It is an excellent project, but I am very concerned about the massive amount of money that has been injected into flat complexes.  I believe the original plan was that it would be accompanied by a new theory of management control and tenant participation.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at the immediate involvement, particularly in refurbished flat complexes, by tenants of these complexes to be involved with the local authority, the Department of the Environment or whatever, in making a contribution in the continuation and management of these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, and I ask you to remind me when it comes to the time.  I welcome the opportunity of speaking in this House on the Bill.  It is to provide a legislative framework for a range of measures contained in this famous document, <i>A Plan for Social Housing.</i> This document which was published in February 1991 with the appropriate pomp and ceremony was full of aspirations but had very little substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> The number of people on the housing waiting list on 31 March 1991 was in excess of 24,000.  This is a frightening statistic.  This number has increased every month since then, but unfortunately the Government have responded with indifference and inactivity.  It is shameful that local authorities were allocated £51 million in 1990 and £62.6 million in 1991 for public housing as against £206 million in 1984.</P>
    <P>Since 1988 the Government have ignored the housing needs of people.  Neither the document <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> nor this Bill gives answers to the problem.  In the document <i>A Question of Choices,</i> a submission to the Dáil and Seanad on aspects of the 1992 budget, the Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors say:</P>
    <P>While this plan contains some imaginative proposals for the future it is hopelessly under-resourced.  There must be some serious questioning of whether it is adequate to tackle the present scale of housing needs.</P>
    <P>Those are the views of independent commentators on this issue.  They go on to say under the heading &ldquo;Choices&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The first choice Government faces in this context concerns responsibility for tackling housing problems.  There is a danger that Government will try to place the responsibility for this principally on the voluntary sector.  Such a move would be totally unacceptable. Housing is a basic human right and should not be dependent on voluntary activity.  It is a Government responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the task of living up to that responsibility.</P>
    <P>While I am very sceptical of many of the measures contained in the document <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> I have to say that it contains some worthwhile proposals which I hope will be implemented in full.  Statistics recently released by the Minister's Department indicate that the number of activities under the various sections of this document is very limited, <Col N="840" /> for example, the small number of sites allocated to people on which to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>I wish to dwell on two aspects of this Bill.  I will deal first with the section on improvement works in lieu of local authority housing.  This is an excellent concept and I hope the Minister can make it workable. As it stands at present, this section is almost unworkable.  For example, in 1991 a sum of £50,000 was allocated for this work in my county but to date none of this money has been used.  Why is this so?  I believe the problem arises mainly from the requirement that people must create a mortgage and set up a repayment system in order to get this money.  I have written to the Minister about this issue but unfortunately he has told me that the system has to stay as it is.</P>
    <P>I believe this money should be allocated by way of a grant to the people concerned.  We should remember that we are talking about people on the housing waiting lists.  Because a widow in my locality does not own her house she has to go through the legal wrangle of putting this right so that a mortgage can be created and a repayment system set up. What will the local authority get out of this scheme?  They will get repayments of £3 or £4 per week from each person.  It will cost them more to work the system than they will get by way of repayments. I accept that the Minister is trying to protect the Government's interests but many times in the past grants for housing were paid to people who were not means tested.  I ask the Minister to allocate this money by way of a grant, which I believe would make the system much more workable. If the Minister wants to protect the Government's interests he should include a provision that the dwelling cannot be sold or passed on.  I think local authorities would agree that the present system is unworkable and should be scrapped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that very much.  My second point relates to the <Col N="841" /> shared ownership scheme.  I am very sceptical about the way this scheme operates and how it will operate in the future. I should like the Minister to give an example of somebody who has availed of the shared ownership scheme, the costings and how it works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>In the booklet published by the Minister reference is made to the repayments on a house which costs £30,000.  A person will have to repay £37 per week on the £15,000 they borrow, plus rent to the local authority, and if they earn in excess of £10,000 they will have to pay £15 a week in rent, giving a total of £52 per week.  If they want to buy out the other £15,000&mdash;this may increase every year as it is index-linked &mdash; they will have to put away some money.  I contend that people in local authority houses will not be able to avail of this scheme.  I accept that the scheme may be workable in the case of people who buy houses which cost £18,000 or £20,000. Nevertheless, I should like the Minister to give examples of where the scheme has worked and the type of people who have availed of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, believe that while this Bill supposedly presents a new departure from the traditional means of housing provision through capital allocations to local authorities for housing construction, it nevertheless fails to address the real issue in housing, that is, affordability. The reason we have a housing crisis is that people are too poor to house themselves.  The State-local authority housing provision perpetuates poverty through social segregation, which begets in turn concentrations of unemployment and inadequate environments for tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to the current crisis lies in a decentralised approach.  As long as housing policy is formulated in the Custom House with no measures to tackle poverty, there is no guarantee that <Col N="842" /> we will see the right kind of buildings in the right places nor the provision of the means whereby people, can afford to live in them.  When I say a &ldquo;decentralised approach&rdquo; I mean giving real, flexible powers and funding for local authorities to meet housing demands and, more importantly, recognising that much of the current crisis is due in no small measure to the unsustainable urban concentration in our big cities.  Rural Ireland is also experiencing a demand for housing which county councils cannot provide due to a lack of resources.  The erosion of traditional livelihoods gives rise to an increase in the number of people moving to towns and cities where there is equally little prospect of employment.  I had intended to speak at some length about travellers, but I will return to this issue on Committee Stage as many of the sections dealing with travellers are unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The central thrust of our housing policy has always been the encouragement of owner-occupation, to the detriment of those who cannot raise the necessary capital for a deposit on a house or sufficient income to meet monthly repayments. Thus the line between owneroccupation &mdash; which gives security of tenure &mdash; and State provision is based on means.  Somewhere in between lies the private rented sector which offers little security and often poor living conditions for those on low income.  The section dealing with notice to quit in the private rented sector gives extra security for all of three weeks.  This is absolutely outrageous. It is the persistent emphasis on owner-occupation which precipitated the measures outlined in the Bill, specifically those regarding shared ownership.  While this is a welcome measure, it makes no impact on the pattern of resource allocation and distribution within the housing system as a whole.  Why is so much of the burden being placed on the voluntary sector to provide accommodation for the homeless, while they receive no assistance with running costs and the only housing authorities defined in the Bill are local authorities?  If voluntary housing bodies, particularly housing associations and housing co-operatives, were given <Col N="843" /> funding and statutory recogition and, indeed, a definition to manage more effectively and at lower cost, local authorities might spend their time and efforts more fruitfully devising ways to accommodate those in immediate need of housing. Until there is a redirection of housing subsidies in a more progressive manner between owner-occupiers on the one hand and tenants on the other, owner-occupiers will continue to enjoy a tax advantage.  Obviously tenants should also enjoy tax relief on rent as counterbalance to mortgage interest allowed to owner-occupiers.</P>
    <P>The Green Party believe there is sufficient wealth in this country to provide an adequate living environment for all. Homelessness in such a severe problem throughout the country that we should consider requisitioning property that has been empty for a long time, particularly in Dublin where vacant floors and buildings contribute to widespread urban dereliction which in itself creates further problems.  None of this is possible, however, without a firm commitment to a real redistribution of wealth which we propose through a guaranteed basic income scheme which would offer those in need a choice of housing as well as the means to provide it for themselves.  A crucial interim measure is the provision of more rented property through community-based housing associations and co-operatives.  Local initiative is a determining factor in the success of such schemes.  While the conventional parties usually see the housing problem in terms of more units, such an approach leads to rhetoric about crash house building programmes.  Rarely do such large scale plans respect local people or local environments. Except for a few experimental initiatives, housing has rarely been understood as part of the socio-ecological system.  The obvious need for housing invariably leads us to ignore the fact that house building is a short-life, resource-intensive industry geared towards a growth in economics which is responsible for homelessness in the first place.</P>
    <P>Bad buildings, as can be seen from the <Col N="844" /> number of major refurbishment schemes underway at present, are not the only failings in contemporary housing. Modern housing construction virtually never makes use of the best form of heat insulation and practical advances in solar energy, water treatment and sewage disposal. Energy use in housing represents 27 per cent of total energy use, with heating accounting for almost 80 per cent of that.  Housing, therefore, is a major contribution to man made emissions of CO2 gases, the worst of the greenhouse gases. Current building regulations only scratch at the surface of insulation technologies and capabilities.  It is thus a great pity that there is no mention of energy use in the Housing Bill.  We believe that the implementation of a comprehensive insulation programme should be intrinsic to a housing policy, local authority dwellings in particular should be upgraded to provide proper standards for tenants.  It is no longer acceptable that those most in need of housing are living in appalling damp and overcrowded conditions. The Bill should rightly establish a new criterion to define energy efficiency and space requirements in houses.</P>
    <P>Tenants in local authority dwellings may not even perform the most basic maintenance for themselves.  Thus, dependency on the State by such a huge proportion of the population is increased. As the organisation, People First, put it, housing is often the key to independent living which is paramount to green philosophy. This would free resources to tackle the problems of those who genuinely require urgent and ongoing assistance in housing.  I regret that I will have to oppose this Bill for the many reasons outlined in my speech.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.  Housing is a subject of wide interest and vital importance. A lively and substantial debate can <Col N="845" /> always be expected whenever housing issues come before the House.  I listened carefully and took note of the numerous points made during the debate and I will try to respond as positively and as constructively as I can.  I will attempt to deal with the main themes which ran through the debate and to answer as many as possible of the specific issues raised.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to acknowledge the general agreement among most Deputies that the broader more rounded approach to social housing needs in the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> and the Bill is the right one.  I must, however, express my disappointment at hearing Deputy Kavanagh, Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Ferris and many other Deputies talking as if the building of large scale local authority housing estates had proved to be the best solution to housing problems. This sort of sentiment is worthy only of someone stuck in a time warp, advocating the policies of the past as the solutions to the problems of the present and the future.  Deputy Mitchell seems to favour the opposite extreme &mdash; a total cessation of local authority housing.  That, of course, is not on the agenda either.  The local authorities still have a major role to play as providers of social housing.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed too, at the cynical attitude of Deputy Gilmore.  He acknowledged the merits of the new approach but accused the Government of having hidden motives for it.  I totally reject this allegation.  The Plan for Social Housing was agreed with the social partners in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It is a totally honest, straightforward and forthright effort to improve the manner in which we address social housing needs by developing a more diverse and flexible range of policy measures.  Why proposals that clearly try to be innovative, to learn from the experience of the past and to correct the mistakes that have been made, should be treated with suspicion I do not understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we must learn from past lessons and adapt our policies accordingly.  We must also look at the experience of different trends in other countries.  We must <Col N="846" /> recognise the changing nature of the problems we are trying to solve.  All this tells us that blanketing large areas of our cities and towns with vast expanses of local authority housing is not the right policy for the future.  We cannot afford the costs &mdash; financial, economic or social &mdash; of going back to these policies of the past.</P>
    <P>One cannot with any credibility call for the building of thousands of extra local authority houses without saying how they are going to be financed, because building houses is a very expensive business. Not one Deputy addressed this critical question.  Deputy Mitchell asked the cost of each local authority house to the taxpayer. That figure now stands at approximately £85 per week.  What other services are going to be cut back to provide the estimated £90,000 which the average single local authority house today is going to cost the taxpayer over the next 20 years?  On top of the rental income we receive from local authorities the tax-payers have to provide, between refurbishment and repair, almost £45 million every year.  Are we not right to see whether there is a new and different way to approach this problem?</P>
    <P>To suggest that we should engage in local authority house building as a job creation measure is off-the-wall thinking. Jobs will only last if they are based on a sustainable foundation.  Likewise, we can only build houses where they are part of a cohesive plan to deal with housing needs in a balanced way.  Deputy Jim Mitchell referred to the house improvement scheme and the number of jobs created by that scheme of the middle-eighties. If the Deputy looks at the statistics for employment he will see that the number employed in the building sector dropped during the operation of that scheme.  It took the correction of the public finances and the lowering of inflation and interest rates to get the building industry to grow again.</P>
    <P>There are also the social costs of housing segregation.  I do not need to go into these in great detail as Deputies are already well aware of them.  The Minister for Justice has found it necessary to set <Col N="847" /> up a special group to look into urban crime and its associated problems, much of it in larger local authority estates.  The concentration of the weaker section of the community into certain areas is a bad principle and exacerbates problems.  We must strive for socially mixed communities and try to replace a dependency culture with one of initiative, self-help and responsibility.  People must be given the chance to take initiatives towards housing themselves through appropriate support for voluntary and co-operative housing.  People must be given more choice in regard to the kind of housing they want.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in understanding the extent of real housing needs.  Nor will I for a moment, deny that needs have been increasing over the past couple of years. This is shown by the latest assessment carried out by local authorities in March 1991, which indicates that some 23,200 households have been approved for local authority housing but not 30,000 as quoted by at least one Deputy.  While the actual figure represents an increase of approximately 20 per cent over the 19,400 households recorded in 1989, it is substantially less than the levels of 30,000 which were experienced in the early eighties. It is also worth noting that of the 23,200, 6,700 are one person households and another 2,800 are couples without children or almost 42 per cent are one person households or married couples without children.  Contrary to the suggestion made by Deputy Gilmore, there has been no attempt to conceal the true extent of housing needs.  The position is in fact set out in fulsome detail in my Department's 1991 housing statistics bulletin which is available to anyone who wants it.  Not alone does the bulletin contain the total figures it breaks them down by category for each housing authority and down to urban council level.  Opposition Deputies should resist the temptation to exaggerate the true extent of housing needs.  I suggest to them that this is not a responsible approach.  It certainly does no service to those in housing need <Col N="848" /> to paint an unduly gloomy picture of their prospects.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening speech, I expect that we will see a substantial increase in social housing provision this year as the social housing plan measures begin to show results.  If local authorities make full use of the various measures and resources at their disposal we could cater for up to 7,000 households in 1992. This figure is made up of new local authority house lettings, additions to their housing stock and casual vacancies, as well as the cumulative effect of the new schemes.  I expect shared ownership to make a significant impact this year.  The voluntary sector, through both the established capital assistance scheme and the new rental subsidy scheme, will also make an increased contribution.  The improvement works scheme and the mortgage allowance will also help to relieve pressure on housing lists.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that the Government are committed to maintaining the local authority housing programme at a level that will have regard to needs and to the resources that can be made available in the very difficult fiscal circumstances in which this country finds itself.</P>
    <P>I also want to put paid to suggestions that while the plan for social housing and the housing Bill are laudable, the absence of adequate funding will prevent their objectives being achieved.  This is not true and to suggest otherwise fails to take account of the substantial increased funding which has been made available in tandem with the plan.  In fact the overall capital provision for housing, including both Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, will be £158 million this year. This represents a full 30 per cent increase on the outturn for 1991.  This substantial increase on the 1991 provision is primarily due to the increased take up of the various new schemes and, in particular, the shared ownership scheme.  A provision of £35 million has been made to cover the capital funding requirements of this scheme in 1992.</P>
    <P>During the period 1990 to 1992 the overall capital allocation from the <Col N="849" /> Exchequer for housing purposes has increased from £51 million to just under £78 million.  The allocation for the provision of local authority housing has increased from £33 million to £41 million while that for the remedial works scheme, including the provision of bathrooms, has increased from £15 million to £18 million.  In addition, the voluntary housing allocation has increased from £9 million to £11 million, with a further £5 million being made available for the rental subsidy scheme.  Allocations in 1992 for the improvement-works-in-lieu scheme, the provision of sites scheme and the mortgage allowance scheme totalling £4.4 million did not exist in 1990.  These increased provisions have been made available during a difficult period for Government finances and are a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to social housing progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Continuous efforts have been made by myself and my predecessor to get local authorities to attain the best possible progress with the various new housing measures.  I refute Deputy Farrelly's suggestion that my Department have not replied to queries about the conditions of these schemes.  Each manager has been briefed and regional conferences have been held for housing officers to deal with any problems or questions that have arisen since the schemes were introduced.  Any practical assistance my Department can give is available.  I agree however that while some authorities have performed well, others have not been as quick to make use of the new options.  Deputies can be assured that I will do everything I can and provide any help I can to see the measures implemented as fully and efficiently as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, I have to make the point that many of the Deputies who come here and criticise progress on the implementation of the social housing plan are members of local authorities.  I would like to see those Deputies encouraging and <Col N="850" /> assisting their authorities to speed up progress on the ground.  Elected members of authorities have a vital role to play in seeing that each authority makes the optimum use of the various measures now available to address the housing needs of their area.  This role involves informing public attitudes and helping to spread an understanding of the options and combinations now available.  It also involves working to remove local obstacles and fostering voluntary and co-operative effort.  I may embarrass Deputies who criticised this plan by letting them know that in their councils the money which was provided for house construction last year was not fully used.  They do not seem to be aware of that.</P>
    <P>Deputies and councillors can do much for housing in their areas if they choose to be constructive and positive.  It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness.</P>
    <P>As regards the local authority housing programme, a further 1,000 new starts have been authorised this year which when added to the starts authorised but not actually commenced in previous years, should enable local authorities to commence up to 1,500 new houses in 1992 as compared to the 1,180 actually started in 1991.</P>
    <P>I have already asked local authorities to ensure that all new starts and completions for which resources have been provided are fully achieved in 1992.  The 1991 outturn figures were disappointing given the pressure on the waiting lists. For example, 1,180 dwellings were actually completed as against projected completions of 1,300.  In the present difficult economic climate which restricts the resources that can be made available, it is incumbent upon housing authorities to ensure that the building/acquisition programme for which they get allocations are fully carried out.  Deputies who are members of local authorities can assist in this regard by positive action at local level where delays or other problems can best be addressed.</P>
    <P>For the sake of historical accuracy, if nothing else, I want to correct the contention by Deputies Kavanagh and Gilmore <Col N="851" /> that it was a Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 that started cutting back the local authority housing programme. The facts are that substantial cut-backs in this programme were commenced by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition in 1984 and progressively continued by them until they left office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would now like to clarify a number of matters relating to shared ownership which arose during the debate.  Deputy Kavanagh is clearly under a misapprehension when he suggests that the requirement in section 2 for the initial downpayment on a shared ownership lease to be between 25 per cent and 75 per cent of the value of the house represents a departure from the 50 per cent initial equity purchase brought in under the local authority system.  It is nothing of the sort.  Section 2 contains the framework for shared ownership leases generally.  It enables the terms of these leases to be tailored to meet the needs of lessor and lessee.  The shared ownership system being operated by housing authorities continues to require an initial payment of 50 per cent, in full conformity with the provisions of the Bill.  Under section 3 that 50 per cent figure can be adjusted up or down within the 25 per cent to 75 per cent limits.  I will not, however, be changing it unless I consider it justified in the light of experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of private sector finance in the shared ownership system, as advocated by Deputies Mitchell and O'Brien, is not alone provided for in the Bill but is envisaged as one of the keystones of the system.  Sections 2 enables individuals and companies, including, builders, banks, building societies and so on, to go into the business of granting shared ownership leases without any reference to housing authorities.  Section 3 envisages financial institutions advancing loans to individuals so that they can <Col N="852" /> acquire houses by shared ownership lease from housing authorities.  I have invited these institutions to provide mortgage funds for local authority shared ownership transactions and also to consider offering shared ownership after the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Under the shared ownership system currently in place, the cost of buying out any portion of the equity in the house during the lease period is calculated by adjusting the original value of that portion of the equity in line with subsequent increases in the consumer price index. The rent only covers part of the cost of the housing authority's borrowings in respect of that share of the equity.  The authority must borrow the money to buy the house in the first instance and must pay interest on their outstanding borrowings until they clear their debt when the buy out of the lease is completed by the shared owner.  Therefore, the buy-out cost of any equity during the lease period could be frozen at its initial value only if the shared owners rent payments were high enough to cover the housing authority's borrowing costs in full.  This would increase the outgoings on the house to an extent that would make shared ownership no longer viable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said he would not advise anyone to enter shared ownership. People should be careful not to be misled by someone who has made a cause of trying to scuttle the shared ownership concept from day one.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Mitchell's concern about the burden of repayments under the shared ownership system, I would like to mention again that section 4 provides for a subsidy towards the rent payable under the lease.  Under the arrangements already in place for housing authority leases, a graduated subsidy, amounting to £700 per annum at maximum, is payable to households earning less than £10,000 per annum.  I am confident that this will be effective in ensuring that low-income households have access to the shared ownership system.  It will also protect them in the event of an unexpected drop in income during the lease period.</P>

      <P>The objectives of section 9 are to bring about an improvement in the maintenance and management of the local authority housing stock and to maximise the return for the associated annual expenditure of £70 million by housing authorities.  There is great potential for improving the image and quality of the management and maintenance service if properly constituted tenant's bodies become involved in the delivery process. This will lead to greater satisfaction on the part of tenants who will have a direct role in running their estates.  Section 9 is also capable of dealing with estates where there is a mixture of tenanted and tenant purchase houses.  My Department have in the past few months issued two detailed circulars to housing authorities requesting them to take positive action in relation to tenant participation.  Options that they could consider were suggested. Obviously, housing authorities will have to provide the necessary resources to enable any delegated functions to be discharged by residents and this is fully provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I also want to reassure Deputy Mitchell that local authorities continue to carry responsibility for maintenance and management of every dwelling until such time as a disposal process has been completed. Section 26 does not change this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell expressed concern over the problem of homelessness and wondered what measures were being taken to resolve it.  The Housing Act, 1988, defined homelessness for the first time in Irish legislation and provided housing authorities with special powers to deal with it.  This Act was put through by a Fianna Fáil Government after four years of indecisive dithering by our predecessor.</P>

      <P>In addition to their usual powers to provide housing for homeless persons, housing authorities can now give assistance by contributing towards the cost of accommodation provided by voluntary bodies.  They can also give financial and other assistance directly to homeless people or arrange private accommodation for them.  My Department recoup 80 per cent of the housing authorities expenditure and in 1991 these recoupments amounted to £377,000.  The 1992 provision is £750,000 which represents an increase of almost 100 per cent over last year.</P>
      <P>Revised guidelines for operating the homelessness provisions have also been issued to housing authorities giving them more flexible spending powers and emphasising the importance of having adequate arrangements in place to meet the needs of emergency cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell also mentioned the aspect of the voluntary housing scheme which allows a voluntary body discretion in allocating 25 per cent of the accommodation qualifying for State grants and 75 per cent of the accommodation must be allocated to persons having specified categories of housing needs.  There is a reason for this flexibility. It allows for a healthy mix of tenants and enables a development to benefit from higher rental income. Despite these potential benefits, however, I would agree with the Deputy, that allocations should be confined to those who have a specific need for housing and that housing authorities should have a strong consultative role in tenant selection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Voluntary housing bodies are not, as Deputy Ferris suggests, being unfairly expected to meet social housing needs. They are making a major contribution to housing disadvantaged groups because they see the benefit that self-help initiatives can bring to communities.  They do not go along with the shortsighted attitude that local authorities on their own can and should solve all housing problems. I also reject that argument.  It has long been recognised that voluntary bodies of their very nature have certain strengths and advantages which enable them to make a unique contribution to meeting housing needs.  In particular, they can operate more speedily, flexibly and economically than housing authorities in the delivery of housing services for elderly, homeless and other people in need.  What the State must do is to encourage this commitment and help it to grow so that, between State and voluntary sectors, the best possible service, be it housing or otherwise, is provided. In recognition of this, the Government <Col N="856" /> have since 1984 actively promoted voluntary housing activity by financial and other assistance resulting in the provision of 580 units of accommodation by the voluntary sector last year alone.</P>
    <P>The new rental subsidy scheme will add further to this level of output by the voluntary sector in 1992.  I am satisfied that the enhanced role for voluntary bodies envisaged in the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> is absolutely right.  It is in fact a necessity if we are going to deliver a balanced and flexible response to housing needs and not miss the opportunity to harness all the resources, both human and financial, that are available to help meet this objective.</P>

      <P>I am glad this House has been afforded the opportunity to have a three hour debate on the whole question of the level of funding for the preparation of our top athletes for the Olympic <Col N="859" /> games.  This motion is opportune because the Olympics will commence on 25 July and also because of the recent controversy following the intervention by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Wilson, regarding the selection of the swimming team for the Olympics.  Mr. Wilson's intervention was unfortunate.</P>

      <P>I consider it inappropriate for any politician to get involved in the selection of our Olympic team.  It is also very unfair and embarrassing for the young girl involved.  The job of Government Ministers is to provide the financial resources necessary for the provision of facilities and training, not to influence team selection: this is the responsibility of the Irish Olympic Council.  I will refer to this incident again at the conclusion of my contribution this evening.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a proud sporting record. For a relatively small nation we have produced many top class sportsmen and sportswomen.</P>

      <P>Names, like Seán Kelly, Stephen Roche, Ronnie Delaney, John Treacy, Eamon Coughlan, Catriona McKiernan, Christy O'Connor and Tony Ward come to mind immediately.  There are so many more.  Irish athletes have won 14 Olympic medals.  At the Olympic games in Melbourne in 1956, Irish athletes won five medals.  Unfortunately, since then our successes have been limited.  The reason for this marked decline is straightforward.  In Ireland we have retained an amateur approach to sport while in other countries modern and professional methods have been adopted in relation to facilities, funding and training for sportsmen and sportwomen. While most countries recognise the importance of providing modern, fully equipped sports facilities, Ireland is still lacking even basic provisions.  We <Col N="860" /> have no Olympic size swimming pool, no proper gymnastics centre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;no proper indoor training facilities for athletics, no centre for the treatment of injuries.  I could go on and on.  There is almost a total lack of physical education in our primary schools.  That is due to lack of trained personnel and facilities.  In other countries physical education is given major prominence in primary schools.</P>

      <P>Physical education is now becoming marginalised even in our post primary schools where almost 50 per cent of leaving certificate students are not offered any physical education whatsoever. Those countries which have achieved the greatest success internationally have made provision for daily programmes of physical education at both primary and post-primary levels.</P>
      <P>Since Fianna Fáil took over the national lottery in 1987 we have had several announcements both within this Chamber and outside it that the Government were about to provide, among other things, a national indoor stadium and a 50-metre swimming pool. We had the now infamous press conference in Kilmainham in 1987 where the former Taoiseach, surrounded by his Cabinet colleagues and Deputy Frank Fahey, the then Minister for Sport, outlined their plans for a national indoor sports stadium and regional sports stadia. In November 1989 Frank Fahey announced that work would commence in the next two or three weeks on the new national sports centre and that it should be completed within three years.</P>

      <P>The then Minister of <Col N="861" /> State at the Department of Education. Indeed, I have a press release from the said gentleman, dated 16 November 1989, which stated quite clearly the work was to begin soon on a national sports centre.  In this press release he promised that work would commence within the next two or three weeks, that the new centre would be completed within the next two or three years and that the bulldozers would be on site within three weeks but we are still waiting.</P>
      <P>In February 1992 the new Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, announced to the Dáil that the Government had abandoned their plans for a national stadium. However, I was glad that, when questioned later, the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for sport, Deputy Aylward, again indicated that the Government were still considering the provision of a national sports stadium.  Will we now be subjected to another list of promises about such a facility?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The national sporting organisations and the sporting fraternity are totally disillusioned with funding for sport in this country.  They are disgusted with the manner in which national lottery funds have been allocated and in many cases how they have been used for political advantage.  In 1986 my colleage, Deputy Seán Barrett, then Minister of State at the Department of Education, with responsibility for sport, when launching the national lottery at the Berkeley Court indicated that 55 per cent of the profits would go to sport and recreational facilities.  It has transpired that only 14.8 per cent of the total income from the national lottery has been allocated to sport.  The entire takings from the national lottery since 1987 is in the region of £757 million &mdash; a massive amount by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> From the entire takings the Government have received £245 million, of which £36.5 million, or 14.5 per cent, has been spent on sport.  It seems ridiculous that out of a lottery that was meant to be for sport only 4.5p out of every pound spent by the man in the street goes to sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Shame on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is absolutely ridiculous.  As a sportsman, I feel that the Irish sporting fraternity have been completely let down.  Surely from such a bonanza it should have been possible to provide a top-class national stadium with a 50 metre swimming pool for some £10 million to £20 million, in the late eighties.  The Government wasted £1.37 million carrying out a feasibility study and on the preparation of development briefs for the site purchased at the dock site.  That money could have gone some of the way towards providing a 50 metre swimming pool.  The £1.37 million could now be regarded as having been wasted, which is disgraceful.  Account should also be taken of the money that has been spent on purchasing that land. What will the Government now do with the land, upon which more than £6 million was invested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consequences of all the inaction and the misleading tactics used by the Government is that Ireland is the only country in Europe not to have a national indoor stadium and a 50 metre swimming pool.  We have to send our swimming athletes to train in 50 metre swimming pools and on athletic tracks in the United States and other countries.  It is estimated that our Olympic council spend 60 per cent of their grant on air fares for travel out of the country to avail of training, coaching and competition.  That is necessary because Ireland does not have basic sporting facilities such as a 50 metre swimming pool, an indoor complex or a decent outdoor track.  Another problem is that it is practically impossible for Ireland to bid to hold major international championships such as European championships or world championships <Col N="863" /> because of a lack of basic facilities.  The Olympic Council of Ireland are very fortunate that they have an agreement with the Italian Olympic Committee and the United States Olympic Committee whereby those committees take on our athletes for free training and coaching at various centres throughout their countries. We are dependent on the goodwill of those countries to provide services free to Irish athletes, but that cannot go on for ever.</P>
    <P>Ireland must now rank among the Third World countries when it comes to funding Olympic sports.  Indeed, many African countries spend more on the preparation of their Olympic athletes than we do.  The grant from the Department of Education to the Olympic Council of Ireland has not increased since 1988, the year of the Seoul Olympics. The grant in 1988 was £500,000; in 1989 it was reduced to £450,000; in 1990 it was £475,000; in 1991 it was just over £500,000; in 1992, £450,000.  This year the Olympic Council of Ireland were given a special £250,000 grant, which has been given for the past two Olympic Games, in order to help in the preparation of the Olympic team.  That money is usually given in the pre-Olympic year and not in the year of the Olympic Games because, as we all know, the important year for preparation is the pre-Olympic year.</P>
    <P>I should like to acknowledge on behalf of those who are interested in the Olympic Games that because of pressure put on the Minister for Finance the grant was restored this year.  It makes no sense that the money could not be made available last year when it was made available this year.  Athletes had only about four months in which to benefit from that allocation.</P>
    <P>When one realises that the grant of approximately £500,000 has to be divided among the 24 federations affiliated to the Olympic Council of Ireland it is obvious that the amount is derisory.  Averaged out, it is worth around £20,000 to each federation.  It is very difficult to prepare Olympic athletes and to expect them to <Col N="864" /> perform well and win on such very small resources.  When one considers that the combined membership of those federations is almost 500,000 and that they share a grant of £500,000, one recognises just how meaningless the allocation is.  A measure of the way in which we treat our Olympic hopefuls is provided by a comparison of the funding given by other countries to their athletes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Luxembourg, which has a population much smaller than that of Ireland, at about 280,000, provides its Olympic council with £1 million a year to prepare athletes.  Norway, which has a population of approximately six million, provides a grant of £8 million for the preparation of their Olympic team.  That support is indeed proving very fruitful because at the recent Winter Olympics in Albertville in France that country won eight gold medals.  The Olympic committees in other EC countries, such as Italy and Denmark, get the majority of the proceeds earned from the football pools.  Financial support for sport in Germany and for the German Olympic team has increased substantially in the past four years.  In France and Germany if an athlete shows special ability he or she is drafted into the civil service sports department and, in most cases, is allowed to train full time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of allowing athletes to train full time can be seen in the progress of an athlete such as Wayne McCullagh, the boxer who has probably the best chance of winning a gold medal in Barcelona. When Wayne won a gold medal for Northern Ireland in the Commonwealth Games in New Zealand, the New Zealand Olympic Committee offered him a substantial incentive to relocate in New Zealand, together with his family and his father, who is his coach, if he would box for that country at Barcelona.  It was lucky for Ireland that he was reluctant to do so and also that the Irish Olympic Council, in order to keep him in Ireland, organised a sponsor so that he could <Col N="865" /> devote himself in the past three years to full-time training.  That is the only way forward.</P>
    <P>We should offer similar opportunities to all of our Olympic hopefuls.  The successes of Séan Kelly, Stephen Roche and the Irish soccer team in recent years have shown that international sporting success brings many benefits to a country.  The most immediate and obvious benefits are that success boosts national pride and morale, raises the profile of a country and enhances its image worldwide. Because its profile is raised in this way sporting success also brings considerable direct economic benefits in the form of increased tourism.  I have met several people involved in tourism in Kerry and other parts of the country and they have assured me that the behaviour of Irish supporters at the European and World Championships in Germany and Italy definitely led to a tourist boost for this country.  The appearance of Roche and Kelly, who are regularly on European television, is also a great boost for our national morale.  If we had more Roches, Kellys and Delaneys there would be a major economic benefit to our country as people of that calibre would be ambassadors for us.  When one considers the amount of money we spend in other types of promotion and on sending others abroad to promote this country, it is obvious that we could justify a far larger contribution towards the preparation of our international sportsmen and sportswomen to do this kind of work for us through the medium of sport.</P>
    <P>The value of successful international sportsmen and sportswomen as role models for a wide range of people should not be underestimated.  This is reflected in the spectacular growth of soccer and cycling in this country.  The Federation of Irish Cyclists reported a 50 per cent increase in cycling club membership in the year following Stephen Roche's win of the Tour de France.  This heightened interest in sport leads to a very important, indirect benefit to international sporting success, i.e. the promotion of higher levels of fitness and health among the population at large.  In the Wimbledon <Col N="866" /> fortnight and when the World Cup competition is on television there is an increased interest in these sports.  The same applies to championship time in gaelic football and hurling.  Young people follow their role models in this regard which can only benefit their health and fitness.  It is very encouraging to see the numbers of people cycling and I am convinced it is because of the success of Kelly and Roche.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister &mdash; it is not too late &mdash; to make a grant of at least £2,000 to each Irish athlete who qualified for Barcelona; 50 have qualified to date and three more are expected to qualify.  This sum, although it may appear small, would be a major boost to many of our athletes and would assist them in their final preparations.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to funding for the 1992-96 Olympic cycle.  The Olympic Council of Ireland made a submission to the Government in 1989, they even arranged for the President of the International Olympic Committee, President Samaranch, to come to Dublin to meet the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, to support their case for funding.  However, there was no response then, nor has there been one since, from the Government. The Olympic Council of Ireland in their submission requested that the Government, as their contribution to promoting the development of sport in Ireland, to help Irish sportsmen and sportswomen to achieve their full potential and to arrest the decline in Irish international success, commit an average of £1.75 million per annum for each Olympic four year cycle. It is critical for the Olympic Council of Ireland to know the funding for each year for the next four years so that they can make a commitment to an élite group of athletes and back them fully in their preparations.  I am convinced that if we put an élite group of athletes through an extensive coaching and training programme over the four year period before the next Olympic in Atlanta in 1996 we would win gold medals.  I am confident that, given greater financial resources, the level of Irish international sporting achievements can be increased; otherwise <Col N="867" /> our sportsmen and sportswomen will not achieve their international potential which means that this country will continue to forego the manifold benefits to be derived from international success.</P>
    <P>The Olympic Council of Ireland would not survive except for sponsorship.  The Irish Olympic Team going to Barcelona in four weeks' time would not be clothed and fitted out properly except for sponsorship, which is a sad reflection on this country.  I appeal to the Government to come to an immediate decision regarding future funding for our Olympic team. We must not remain the Cinderella of Europe.  There is a great wealth of potential sporting talent in this country but the Government must provide the financial resources needed to ensure its development. The first people to jump on the bandwagon if we win a gold medal in Europe will be the politicians; it brings me back to the time the Irish soccer team returned after playing in the European Championship and the World Cup.  It was a disgrace to see the platform dominated that night by politicians from several different parties.  Some people &mdash; but not all &mdash; were entitled to be present; in this country politicians are very quick to jump on the bandwagon when there is a successful outcome but they are very slow to give the necessary financial support to sport.  When Gary O'Toole returned from Europe having won a silver medal in the European Championships he was met at the airport by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Frank Fahey, who told Mr. O'Toole that a swimming pool would be provided in time for the Barcelona Games.  He pledged that Ireland would have a 50 meter pool in time to train for the Barcelona Olympics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a man for whom I have great respect.  However, I should like to refer to the case of Gina Galligan. As I said, I have great respect for the Minister, we are the only two all Ireland medal holders in this House.  I would be the first to accept that Gina Galligan is a swimmer with great potential and I feel that she will make it to the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996.  Last year she became the first competitor to qualify for the final of a European junior championship event where she finished fifth with a time of one minute, 13.53 seconds for the 100 meter breast stroke, a new Irish record. More recently she finished third in an international event in France with a time of one minute, 11.80 seconds, another new Irish record.  However &mdash; this is very important &mdash; the time set by the Irish Amateur Swimming Association was one minute, 11.43 seconds for the ladies' 100 metre breast stroke last year on the understanding that only those who reached that time would be nominated. The Irish Olympic Council had no option but to leave her out.</P>
      <P>Other athletes, such as Christine Kennedy, the marathon runner, who has represented Ireland at every level except the Olympics and Marion Madine, must also feel justifiably disappointed.  Christine missed the marathon time by just five seconds while Marian Madine made the time set for qualification.  However the race in which she made that time had no official status.  I believe the Tánaiste had no grounds on which to approach the Irish Olympic Council to try, according to press reports, and I have numerous reports in front of me, to influence their decision on the composition of the swimming team for Barcelona.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should add that Article 31.5 of the Olympic Charter states that the National Olympic Councils <Col N="869" /> shall preserve their autonomy and resist all pressures of any kind, including those of a political, religious or economic nature, that may prevent them from complying with the Olympic Charter.  I should say to the Tánaiste that what the Irish Olympic Council and sport generally need is financial support to ensure that proper coaching and training facilities and back-up services are provided without intervention from politicians in relation to team selection.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste will have an opportunity to reply to the various allegations that have been made but they must have been very serious because never before in the history of the State has an official of the Irish Olympic Council made such an allegation.  When one considers that a complaint has been made to the International Olympic Council it must be very serious.  As my party's spokesperson on sport, I can only presume that the Tánaiste exerted heavy pressure on that official to try to ensure that Gina Galligan was selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste will have an opportunity to reply.  It was unfair to put the Irish Olympic Council under such pressure.  In addition, it must have been a source of great embarrassment for Gina Galligan.  Our young athletes deserve better and should not be embarrassed. As I said, the newspaper reports must have been the source of embarrassment and discouragement for that young girl who has great potential and who still trains and coaches young people.  It is the last thing they need at this time.  What they need is encouragement and not political interference or shenanigans.</P>
      <P>The Government should have made better use of the resources that have been available to them from the national lottery during the past five years.  They have let the sporting fraternity down.  I have no doubt that if they had provided a 50 metre swimming pool Gina Galligan would have qualified at this stage.  The ultimate insult was to try to influence the decision and have this girl selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  As a former Minister with responsibility for sport I wish the present incumbent every success in his new position. My tenure in office was probably one of the most enjoyable periods of my political career and I sincerely hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, will get the same enjoyment from it.  I should say however that what has been happening since 1987 in the area of sport, having regard to the development of the national lottery, is nothing short of a scandal.  The funds from that source have literally been hijacked.</P>
      <P>The national lottery dates back to the time Mr. Donal Creed was Minister with responsibility for sport.  It was he who put forward the idea that we should have a national lottery to raise funds for sport. Following his departure it fell to me to introduce the lottery.  It was the intention that the funds would be used solely for sport, and no one should be fooled into thinking that that was not the case.  Needless to say, once the money was made available everyone wanted to put their hand into the till.  The Irish people were asked to contribute on a voluntary basis to a national lottery so that substantial sums of money would be available for the development of sport and recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Deenihan, has outlined the benefits to be gained in having top class athletes &mdash; unpaid ambassadors &mdash; competing abroad wearing the Irish vest.  They do so mainly in their spare time using their own money. However, they do occasionally receive some assistance from Government Departments but as I said, basically they are unpaid ambassadors.  As Deputy Deenihan rightly said, when they are successful all of us are ready to jump on the bandwagon and share their success but nobody wants to know them when they have to put in many long hours of training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> What has happened in relation to the Irish Olympic Council is nothing short of a scandal either.  In 1984, after the Los Angeles Olympic Games, we decided during one period in Government that a four year plan should be drawn up for the Seoul Olympic Games.  In 1985, we gave the Irish Olympic Council a sum of £240,000 to prepare a team for those games.  The following year provided a further sum of £275,000.  Therefore in the space of two years over £500,000 was provided by the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government to the Irish Olympic Council to prepare our athletes for the 1988 Olympic Games.  Unfortunately, we left office in 1987 and the whole thing fell flat on its face.  Not alone have this Government and their predecessors, the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987, hijacked the national lottery, they have set sport back to the early sixties and seventies position.</P>
    <P>In 1986, I included a provision in the Finance Act to allow individuals give gifts to Cospóir for the development of sport and to offset these gifts against their individual or corporate tax.  That was a good idea.  The provision was introduced to encourage individuals and companies to invest in sport and claim the expense against their tax in the same way that people in the Arts area can claim against their tax.  What has happened to this provision? I have not read anything about it and no one seems to be promoting it.  I am aware that the Department of Finance were not too pleased about it but the Government decided, and rightly, that it should be included in the Finance Act but why is it not being promoted?  Therefore not alone is there no Government investment in sport, the national lottery funds have been hijacked and the provision in the Finance Act is not being promoted, yet we want our athletes to compete at the top level and represent this country abroad at international events, including the Olympic Games, against the might of other European countries, the United States, Australia and other well known sporting countries.</P>
    <P>Let us compare the cost of sending an <Col N="872" /> athlete to the Olympic Games with the sums of money we give small clubs the length and breadth of this country, many of whose members look after young children in under-privileged areas seven days a week, selling raffle tickets and so on to keep the clubs in existence, or let us compare what we are spending on sport per head of the population with the cost of maintaining one child, who consistently offends, in Trinity House.  It costs £65,000 per annum to keep one youth in Trinity House while it costs £30,000 per annum to keep someone in Mountjoy.  Yet we have taken the national lottery funds &mdash; introduced and meant for sport and recreation &mdash; hived them off, here there and everywhere, with political favours being handed out to golf clubs and to other areas for which it was never intended.  We must remember it is not Government money.  It is comprised of individual donations to sport and recreation.  It was never intended to be the business of Government to use those funds for other needs. Those funds should be passed directly from the national lottery to a sports council established on a statutory basis to administer the proportion of national lottery funds allocated for sport and recreation. Indeed their administration should not be the responsibility of any Government Department; it has nothing to do with Government; it is not taxation but a matter of individuals contributing voluntarily to the national lottery.</P>
    <P>Let us cease talking about the problems of vandalism, unemployment and so on.  The Government should cop on to themselves and change tack in relation to the national lottery.  Even if the figure of 55 per cent, agreed in 1986, is reduced to 40 per cent, 30 per cent, or whatever may be the figure decided, that money should be given to the people who need it for the promotion of sport and recreation. Some of it should be given to local authorities and vocational education committees to assist small clubs nationwide where people give their time voluntarily to cater for young boys and girls without any outside help.</P>
    <P>For example one club in my area has <Col N="873" /> 21 teams, that in an area where unemployment is between 75 and 80 per cent. The annual running costs of that club amount to approximately £14,000.  Last year, through various means, they managed to raise a sum of £11,000 and are now £3,000 in debt.  One should remember the effort that must be put into running a club of young people with 21 teams, in the provision of transport, footballs, training, gear, in an area in which, whenever a function is organised, committee members must collect £1 a week to make up the £5 for a ticket.</P>
    <P>Millions of pounds are being spent on national lottery tickets with no significant amount being invested in sport, recreation or in helping young people, keeping them occupied rather than resorting to crime.  We pay £65,000 per child in Trinity House and £600 weekly to keep somebody in Mountjoy Prison, yet we cannot afford to give a small grant to clubs or athletes to prepare themselves for the Olympics.  These entrants are cheap ambassadors for this country.</P>
    <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, in his efforts to bring pressure on this Government to do something in the sporting area.  The Olympic Games are in the offing.  Olympic athletes cannot be appropriately encouraged or prepared by simply giving them a grant in the year in which the Olympic Games take place. There must be a four-year programme, guaranteeing the Olympic Council that, over those four years, they will receive X amount of money to prepare athletes, allow them compete abroad, to allow them train properly, to invest funds in regional facilities, so that people will be encouraged to engage in such sporting events.  There is no point in giving a few pounds to the Olympic Council and expecting them to perform miracles at the eleventh hour.  There must be an agreed figure &mdash; as there was in 1985 and 1986 &mdash; spread over a four-year period.  The record will show that the figures I have quoted here this evening are accurate &mdash; £240,000 in 1985 and £275,000 in 1986. Those were two years of the four-year plan and the relevant amounts given to <Col N="874" /> the Olympic Council while we were in Government.</P>
    <P>I urge the Tánaiste, a member of the Cabinet &mdash; I know how difficult it can be for a Minister with responsibility for sport who is not around the Cabinet table to fight his or her corner &mdash; who has an interest in sport to use his best endeavours to that end.  The problem with which he became involved has been dealt with. I sincerely hope all of us will have learned a lesson from that.  I appeal to the Government, through the Tánaiste, to re-think their attitude to the national lottery, to commit a percentage of the takings to sport and recreation.  The Minister may have his ideas as to how they should be distributed.  I have made some positive proposals &mdash; a four-year funding plan for the Olympic Council, and the establishment of a statutory sports body to properly administer those funds for sport and recreational purposes without any political interference.  The last thing sports people want is politicians interfering in sport.  Let us not forget the many small clubs nationwide in need of help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the level of funding provided by the Government to the Olympic Council of Ireland during the current Olympic cycle and notes the assistance, both financial and through the provision of facilities, being made available to assist Ireland's outstanding sportspersons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity of speaking on this motion on the funding for the Olympic Council of Ireland.  In response to the points made by Deputy Deenihan, I want to put before the House the accurate position regarding the level of funding for the Olympic Council, which has been the subject of severe and unfair criticism for quite some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, let me state that both <Col N="875" /> myself and my Department have a very good relationship with the Olympic Council of Ireland.  Since my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for Sport, in February last, I have met the Olympic Council of Ireland on two occasions to discuss a wide range of issues, including the level of Government funding for the council.  It is my intention to develop further the already excellent working arrangements which exist between the Olympic Council and my Department.</P>
    <P>Government policy on sport is based on the following premises: first, it is considered that participation in sporting and active leisure pursuits promotes good health and enhances the quality of life to the benefit of the individual and the community; second, it has an educational role in contributing to the development of leadership and social skills in individuals. Among the good influences of involvement in sport and leisure activities are a feeling of well being, a means of occuping spare time, in addition to providing skills, motivation and self-confidence to seek opportunities for both gainful employment and voluntary service; third, it has a capacity to promote increased economic activity both within the community and from increased tourism; and fourth, meritorious performances by Irish sportspersons in international arenas increase the country's prestige and image among the community of nations, and participation in sport can act as an antidote to vandalism and anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>Sport policy is aimed at increasing these benefits by raising standards of performance generally and in particular, the standards of our elite sportspersons at international level and by increasing participation in sport and leisure activities.</P>
    <P>The aims of policy in the elite sport area are to allow the full development of talent, to provide a sporting spectacle for the public, to allow countries to communicate through the vehicle of elite sport, to demonstrate the strength of sport as a way of life, to promote a base <Col N="876" /> for elite sport, to provide a motivation for healthy objectives, to allow talent to develop and to occupy young people in play activity with health and ethical objectives.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a very proud tradition in the world of elite international sport. Immediately, we think of the successes of the Irish soccer team, of Seán Kelly and Stephen Roche, the achievements of our professional and amateur golfers and the performances of our athletes, rowers and canoeists.  In the Olympic field, although our level of success in recent Olympiads has been low we have won 14 Olympic medals.  These successes have been hard earned through the dedication of the individuals involved and the assistance and support provided by the respective sporting organisations which are supported by the Government.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the policy on elite sport, grants are paid annually to the national governing bodies of sport from the proceeds of the national lottery for expenditure in the following areas: assistance for the employment of development officers by six organisations; assistance to meet the cost of administrators and coaches by 30 governing bodies; grants to purchase specialist equipment; grants to meet costs associated with exchange schemes with France, Germany and Italy and grants to meet the costs of attending or hosting major international events.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the House of Sport was established in Walkinstown.  It acts as a headquarters for 12 governing bodies of sport and has been equipped with modern office equipment and modern technology. In 1992 the level of funding for these programmes will be in excess of £2.9 million.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Olympic Council of Ireland, my Department provide an annual grant to the council to assist with meeting the costs of the international programme of the 24 sporting organisations which are affiliated to the Olympic Council and to help defray the costs of other initiatives undertaken by the Olympic Council which are aimed at increasing standards.  I should add that each of these organisations is also in <Col N="877" /> receipt of funding from my Department under the general grants scheme for national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    <P>To give a full picture of the level of funding allocated specifically for the Olympic Council of Ireland, I wish to put the following facts before the House.  In the four year Olympic cycle from 1985 to 1988 the total amount of funding awarded to the Olympic Council of Ireland for the preparation and training of athletes for the Seoul Olympics was £1,390,000.</P>
    <P>In the current four year Olympic cycle, from 1989 to 1992, the level of funding has increased by 62.5 per cent to £2,222,000.  The individual annual allocations are as follows, and I think I should refer back to the period referred to by Deputy Barrett when the then Coalition Government were in office from 1983 to 1986: in 1983 the figure allocated was £125,000; in 1984, £240,000; in 1985, £240,000 and in 1986, £275,000.  The Government changed in 1987 and the figure was increased from £275,000 to £375,000.  In 1988 the figure was £500,000; in 1989, £450,000; in 1990, £505,000; in 1991, £567,000 and in 1992, £700,000.</P>
    <P>I have referred to 1988 which was Olympic year, when a grant of £500,000 was allocated by my Department, whereas in this Olympic year a grant of £700,000 has been allocated and already paid.  This allocation is an increase of 23 per cent on the 1991 allocation of £567,000.  I am certain that all fair-minded sports people will agree that there have been substantial increases in the level of funding being made available to the OCI.  I must state, however, the expression of gratitude from spokespersons of the Olympic Council of Ireland has been muted.  Indeed, the public could be forgiven for being misled as regards the true position of Government funding levels.  Equally, I am sure that many people would find it strange that the Olympic Council should state quite categorically that no representative of the Government would be welcome at a function to welcome home any successful Olympic sportsperson.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions governing my</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Department's scheme of assistance for sporting organisations is a requirement that organisations should raise up to 50 per cent of the annual income through fund-raising and sponsorship.  While I have not been provided with any information in relation to the sponsorship or other income of the Olympic Council, I am confident that, particularly in Olympic year, there are opportunities for the attraction of substantial sponsorship from non-governmental sources.</P>
    <P>We all are aware of the many commercial sponsorship arrangements which are operating at the moment in support of the Olympic Council's preparation for the games.  I understand that there are up to 11 companies involved in such sponsorship which must be yielding generous amounts of money.  I referred earlier to the allocation of £700,000 to the OCI for 1992 by the Government.  In a recent submission from the Olympic Council it was stated that the council expected to expend £900,000 on the programmes for the Olympics.  I venture to state that it should not be too difficult to meet the balance of £200,000 through sponsorship and other income.  Indeed, it would hardly be considered desirable for an independent autonomous body like the OCI, who publicly state their independence from the Government, to be in a position where the Government were the sole provider of funding for their operation and I am sure that the OCI would not wish this is to be the situation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the grants to the national sporting organisations and the OCI my Department are also involved in funding a number of other programmes which have a direct benefit for our Olympic team.  In the four years since the last Olympic Games in Seoul, grants in excess of £300,000 have been paid out to individual athletes who are affiliated to the Olympic sports.  Under the scheme grants are awarded to individual sports persons to enable them to undertake training and competition at the highest level and to compete with distinction at international events and to assist outstanding junior sports persons who have achieved a standard of national significance in their particular <Col N="879" /> sport to undertake specialised training and compete in international competitions.  Let me say that athletes are training full time with assistance from the outstanding sports persons' grant scheme.  Garry O'Toole, Liam Wylie, Michael Corcoran and Niall O'Toole are examples.  Wayne McCullagh has benefited substantially also from the outstanding sports person's grant scheme.</P>
    <P>These grants, which range from £1,000 to £5,000 per individual sports person per annum, are of tremendous benefit to the individual sports persons who have benefited and in fact a number of them have taken the trouble to write to my Department outlining the benefits of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In April of this year I opened the national coaching and training centre at the University of Limerick which has as it twin aims the introduction of a coach education programme and the provision of facilities, both of a physical and physiological nature, to enable our top sports persons to train in the most modern facilities with an excellent medical back-up. This facility, which is being used extensively by elite sports persons, will play a major role in the preparation of our athletes for international competitions. In particular, I am very pleased that Bord Lúthchleas na h-Éireann have decided to use this excellent centre for some of their pre-Olympic training and I would encourage other sporting organisations to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there have been many new facilities provided which, while they cater for the local needs, also provide a good training facility for the elite sports persons.  For example, in the past four year many new facilities have been provided.  The type of facility I am referring to includes athletic facilities at Waterford, Limerick, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Donegal and Dublin together with the provision of the country's first indoor synthetic athletic facility at Nenagh.  Further funds are being provided for the provision and upgrading of athletic tracks at Galway, Tullamore, Monaghan and Santry Stadium, Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> Work can start on all of these projects in 1992 provided that the technical difficulties which have delayed them can be overcome.  This major expansion of our stock of athletic facilities I am sure will provide a basis for the continued growth and enhanced performance of athletics in the country.  A total of £5.25 million has been provided for the development of athletic facilities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In addition to funds being provided to local communities for the provision of multi-purpose sports halls, funds have also been provided to national governing bodies of sport for the improvement of their specialist facilities.  These include the boxing stadium, Dublin, badminton centre, Baldoyle and the national basketball centre, Tallaght, which is currently under construction.  It is my intention to continue to provide and improve the specialist sport facilities for our national governing bodies of sport. Swimming pools are being planned or improved at Sligo, Cork, Tralee and Carrick-on-Suir at a cost of £3.55 million.</P>
    <P>Although great strides have been made in recent years in the provision of funding for the sporting organisations and in the provision of a range of sporting facilities much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan in his opening remarks made great efforts to make political capital out of the decision of the Government not to proceed with the proposed national sports centre at the Custom House Docks site.  That has been the subject of parliamentary questions tabled by Deputy Deenihan on many occasions.  Circumstances have changed in a number of relevant ways since the feasibility study, on which this project was based, was carried out.  The changed circumstances include, (a) the development of conference facilities at a number of locations throughout the city; (b) the emergence of the Point Depot with a seating capacity for 9,000 persons as a pop concert venue; (c) the provision of a new badminton centre at Baldoyle under the regional programme; (d) the refurbishment of the National Boxing Stadium which has a 2,000 seating capacity; (e) <Col N="881" /> the inclusion of a national basketball stadium in Tymon, Tallaght, in the regional programme, with a capacity for 3,500 persons, catering for all major basketball events and providing facilities for other games such as volleyball, badminton and gymnastics &mdash; work commenced on this project with a completion date of Deccember 1992 &mdash; and (f) the development of the House of Sport facility in Walkinstown, to which I referred, which acts as a headquarters for 13 national sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy Deenihan to tell the House the major sporting events which are lost to Ireland because the project he referred to will not now go ahead.  The Government decided that the centre would not go ahead as envisaged at that time.  This is not to suggest that the proposal cannot be reactivated at a future date.  When I replied to questions on this issue I was consistent in what I said.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Barrett referred to the moneys available for sport.  I agree that any Member who has been involved in sport would say that there is never enough money available for sport. However, we must compare like with like.  At the time the previous Government took the decision that 55 per cent of the proceeds from the national lottery should go to sport the estimated proceeds from the national lottery was approximately £10 million.  On this basis the 55 per cent proceeds for sport would represent £5.5 million.  The provision made by my Department in 1992 for sport is £5.35 million for current expenditure and an additional £4.5 million for capital expenditure, a total of £9.89 million.</P>
    <P>I admit that one of the major deficiencies is the absence of a 50 metre swimming pool complex which in addition to providing a modern facility to host international competitions would also enable our international swimmers to train at home.  I am perfectly committed to the provision of such a facility and I am at present considering a number of proposals for its provision.  In an effort to alleviate the disadvantage of the elite swimmers having to travel abroad for 50 metre pool training my Depart <Col N="882" /> ment have provided special grants to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association to help defray the costs of attendance at such facilities abroad.  I realise that the association are very anxious that progress be made on this facility and I would like to assure them I am confident that in the not too distant future it will no longer be necessary for Irish swimmers to travel abroad for 50 metre pool training.  At this point I wish to compliment the swimmers who are ranked highly in the world rankings on their achievements which have been attained despite the absence of a 50 metre pool in Ireland.</P>
    <P>On an occasion such as this I must state that I have been concerned with the uneasy relationships which exists between the Olympic Council of Ireland and some of their affiliated sporting organisation members at present.  I urge all those involved in the controversy to remember that it is not the Olympic Council of Ireland, the national governing bodies of sport or the Government who are important but rather the sportspersons who have made many sacrifices to pursue their very severe training and competition schedules over the years to attain the distinction of representing their country at the highest international level.</P>
    <P>The Irish people expect the controlling interests within the Olympic Council of Ireland and the individual sports to continue to show maturity and leadership in their deliberations and to act in a fair and just manner to provide unified support for our Olympic hopefuls and to ensure that public controversy does not damage the sportsperson in his or her preparation for the games.  We would be better off without much of the recent publicity in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am saddened at the recent controversy between the Tánaiste and the Olympic Council of Ireland.  I am also disappointed that Deputy Deenihan, an outstanding sportsperson, like the Tánaiste, found it necessary to criticise the Tánaiste tonight.  It is the right of a member of the Government or any Member of the Oireachtas to make an inquiry or representations in relation to the composition of the team for the <Col N="883" /> Olympics.  The manner in which the OCI reacted to the inquiry from the Tánaiste, and the public exposure of what was a private approach to the OCI on a sensitive issue, is to be frowned upon.  It is ironic that a body, who are prepared to use the political lobby very extensively, when it is advantageous to do so, would react in such a fashion to a telephone call from a member of the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to state categorically that the Government do not want to be involved in the selection of the Olympic team, but surely they have the right to make inquiries or representations in relation to matters which are of such public interest. This right has been accepted by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding for the Olympic Council of Ireland for the forthcoming Olympic cycle leading up to the Games in Atlanta, it is my intention to meet with the OCI following the Barcelona Games to review the performance of the Irish team and to look ahead and examine the prospects for 1996.</P>
    <P>When the OCI have prepared a submission which clearly identifies their intentions and requirements for each of the sports involved, which demonstrates a coherent and planned approach in the build-up to Atlanta in 1996, citing clearly the objectives to be achieved during the four-year cycle, the indicators of development that can be expected and the financial input required both from the Government and private sources, the question of funding for the council can then be considered.  I stress that the Government will be earnestly endeavouring to provide significant support to the OCI having regard to the available finances at the time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish every member of the Irish Olympic team every success in their quest for success at this summer's Olympic Games.  The Irish, who are a great sporting nation, love to see sportspersons in the green singlets compete with distinction in what is the greatest sporting festival in the world.  Whether they win gold, silver or bronze the fact <Col N="884" /> that they have reached the high standards set for qualification for the Olympics is a very significant achievement and we all support them in their endeavours.  I compliment and thank the Olympic Council of Ireland, and the individual governing bodies of sport, on their dedication and commitment to the development of sport in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The information which I have provided tonight shows that the Government are committed to the provision of funds to the Olympic Council of Ireland and the individual sporting organisations to assist them with their efforts to ensure that the disadvantages under which some of sportspersons compete are being reduced quickly.  I know that there are other initiatives we need to take but I hold the view that substantial progress has been made in recent times.  I assure the House that it is my intention to further that aim while I am in office.  I recommend to the House the Government's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support the Fine Gael motion.  I compliment Deputy Deenihan on bringing this motion before the House for discussion. The question of sport, and the provision of adequate resources for it, are burning issues among Irish sportspersons at present.  I say this not only as spokesperson on sport for the Labour Party but also as a person who has been involved in sport and youth work for many years.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the need that exists at present.  With only four weeks to the 1992 Olympics the timing of this motion has to be questioned.  Taking into account the restrictive timescale, any practical assistance coming from the Government will be of limited benefit for the training programme of the 52 people already nominated for the Olympics.  Notwithstanding that, we look forward to additional funding, particularly as training for the Olympics is a long term commitment in terms of time and funds. Following the Olympic Games the Minister should devise a programme for the next four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a proud sporting tradition. Over the years Irish competitors have <Col N="885" /> won 14 Olympic medals.  In addition, an Irishman, Lord Killanin, has held with distinction the position of President of the International Olympics Committee for more than eight years.  This is a great honour not only for himself and his family but for Ireland as a whole.  I can still remember listening on a crackling radio to the 15,000 metres final for men in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games when a 21 year-old Irishman Ronnie Delaney, who was on a scholarship to America at the time, won the premier Olympic event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That same year, Irish athletes won five medals but since then Irish Olympic successes have declined somewhat. I remember Ronnie Delaney after his success kneeling down on the track and blessing himself.  The success that year was a great boost for Irish sport and for the Irish people.  Thirty-six years ago certain commitments were given as there was a need to improve facilities for Irish sportsmen and women to enable them to prepare for the Olympic Games if they so wished.  However, 36 years later, those commitments have still not been met. That indicates that there is no real commitment in this House to sport.</P>
      <P>The Government have continued to ignore the plight of Irish sport and Irish athletes.  Various interested bodies have provided the Government with the relevant information in regard to the needs and requirements of our Olympic team but most of them have received a negative response.  Among the submissions was one made in 1989 by the Olympic Council of Ireland.  They received nothing but lip service.  I would ask the Minister whether he has read a report that is lying on his desk gathering dust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 25 sports federations affiliated to the OCI.  The combined membership of these organisations is nearly 500,000.  In that context, I pose the question, how much finance have the OCI received from Government?  In 1988, as the Minister has admitted, £500,000 was <Col N="886" /> provided by the Government; in 1989, £450,000; in 1990, £475,000; in 1991, £525,000 and this year, the year of the Olympics, £450,000 is being provided plus a special budget allocation of £250,000.</P>

      <P>This is my first opportunity to congratulate Deputy Aylward on his promotion. I wish him the very best of luck in a difficult position.  I would like to refer briefly &mdash; perhaps the Minister will think this a little unfair &mdash; to his first exclusive interview with <i>The Sunday Press</i> on 23 February.  It was a very outgoing interview in which he made two particular references.  The interviewer, Liam Hayes, stated that topping the list of needs in the Minister's eyes were extra funding for the Olympic Council and the building of a 50 metre swimming pool. The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>In the meantime, we have to build a 50-metre swimming pool.  We can't wait any longer for that.  An international sized swimming pool is a must and we are getting down to do something about it immediately.  It's also Olympic year and we can't forget that.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>The Olympic Council received a special allocation of £250,000 in the budget but we still have to make the Olympics a special case.  I do not know how much we can put on top of that figure at this stage but we will have to make it something substantial.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister acknowledges that the allocation to the Olympic Council of Ireland is inadequate and this matter must be dealt with.  I hope the Minister will see the merit of the case put forward by everybody in this House and that in summing up he will give a little hope to the 52 people who have been selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important when talking about the Olympic Council of Ireland to put on record the 25 bodies affiliated to them, many of whom could be classified as the minority sports groups.  Many of them are finding it very difficult to continue, including the Irish Amateur Archery Association, Bord Lúthcleas na hÉireann, the Irish Basketball Association, the Badminton Union of Ireland, <Col N="888" /> the Irish Bobsleigh Association, the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, the Irish Canoe Union, the Irish Clay Pigeon Shooting Association, the Federation Irish Cyclists, the Equestrian Federation of Ireland, the Irish Amateur Fencing Federation, the Football Association of Ireland, the Amateur Gymnastics Association, the Irish Hockey Union for Men, the Irish Judo Association, the Irish Ladies Hockey Union, the Irish Amateur Rowing Union, the Irish Tabletennis Association, the Irish Amateur Weight-lifting Association, the Irish Amateur Wrestling Association, the Irish Yachting Association and the Irish Badminton Union.  I recently met representatives of some 20 sports associations catering for what could be called minority sports. They were very angry that the Government were only paying lip service to sport.  They said clearly that the national lottery is interfering with the ability of local clubs to run draws in order to get the type of finance required to allow these clubs and organisations to continue to exist.  In County Dublin, for example, the most that such clubs could get from the local vocational education committee during the last four or five years was £100 per annum.  Lottery funding which was originally intended for sport, recreation and youth has been hi-jacked to a great extent and they want something done about it.</P>
    <P>The annual report for 1991 for the national lottery stated clearly that the transfer to the Exchequer for distribution in 1991 was £100,200,000.  In 1991 sport got an allocation of £12,154,000.  The total allocation for youth, recreation and sport was £29.5 million out of a total of £100 million which could be distributed from the Exchequer.  In recent years Governments have disgracefully treated youth, sport and recreation in financial terms.  The people involved in these areas are providing sporting and recreational facilities and are keeping young people out of trouble under the umbrella of the Olympic Council of Ireland.  They are now clearly saying that enough is enough. The decision last year to defer building <Col N="889" /> a national sports stadium, including an Olympic-size pool and an indoor athletics track, reflected badly on the Government. A number of Minister, including Deputy Fahey, made commitments on this.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey, as Taoiseach, gave a firm commitment in his last Ard Fheis address that the project would go ahead.  Since 1987 the Government have made noises about the establishment of a number of regional sports centres and a national sports centre, but we are still awaiting development in these areas.  The standard of sports facilities here is well below the European average. Ireland, as part of an integrated Europe, will compete with countries who have a long tradition of success at international level.  Our standard in sport must correspond with the standard in member states.  How can we hope to compete on an equal basis with our European partners, with the US, Australia and the African countries when this Government refuse to sponsor the building of this vital sports stadium?  We must be able to compete on a comparable basis.  The track record of the Government leaves a lot to be desired and this is being recognised by people involved in sport.  The people who have given their time and energy in sporting areas feel that they are being taken for granted.  More than 500,000 people are involved in sport.  They should be able to make a political case for themselves. They should have put forward a legitimate case.  I hope they will press all Governments in the future to ensure that the needs of sport are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland we have retained an amateur approach to sport.  I do not disagree with that but there are disadvantages given the development of sport in other countries where professional policies have been adopted in relation to facilities, funding and training for sportsmen and women. An examination of the way in which sport is organised and funded in more successful countries bears out this contention. A fuller illustration of this can <Col N="890" /> be found in the success of the Irish on the professional front.  I would mention the likes of Stephen Roche, Seán Kelly, Barry McGuigan and the Irish soccer team.  Their success could not have been attained without professional assistance, back-up and training facilities which are so much a part of modern sport needs. While most countries recognise the importance of providing modern fully equipped sporting facilities, we are still lacking even basic facilities.  We do not have an Olympic swimming pool, notwithstanding the commitments.  We do not have a proper gymnastics centre nor do we have indoor training facilities for athletics.  Neither do we have a single recognised centre for coaching.  These matters were always on the agenda but unfortunately they were always pushed into the background.  I hope that on the basis of this discussion we can bring them to the top of the agenda or as near the top as possible.</P>

    <Title>Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 10.</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (b), line 11, after &ldquo;give&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;degrees,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy J. Higgins.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This series of amendments deal with the question of whether the Dublin Institute of Technology should be allowed to confer its own degrees.  At present 30 per cent of the students attending Dublin Institute of Technology colleges are pursuing degree courses, which are awarded by way of special arrangement with Trinity College. Section 5 sets out the functions of the institute but the conferring of degrees is precluded by subsection (1) (a). However, ministerial amendments state that the Minister may have &ldquo;other functions&rdquo;<Col N="891" /> in regard to the colleges.  It is not good drafting procedure to have two subsections which to some extent contradict each other.  However, the ministerial amendments are moving in the direction of giving more autonomy and academic freedom in terms of conferring degrees, post-graduate degrees and honorary awards and that is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) states that the principal function of the Institute shall be (b) &ldquo;to confer, grant or give diplomas, certificates or other educational awards, other than degree awards.&rdquo;  It is proposed to amend subsection (2) (a) by inserting after &ldquo;other functions&rdquo; the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;,which may include the function of conferring degrees, postgraduate degrees and honorary awards&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When the new amendments are taken on board, the Bill will be somewhat sloppy in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy O'Shea's observations on the &ldquo;degree of qualification&rdquo;, to use a pun, that we are now giving to the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.  In our amendment No. 10 we propose to insert after the word &ldquo;give&rdquo; the word &ldquo;degrees&rdquo;.  The subsection would then read:</P>
      <P>to confer, grant or give degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards, other than degree awards;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have put them in their relative order of merit.  As Deputy O'Shea said, the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges have conferring powers by virtue of their very successful joint ventures with the University of Dublin, Trinity College. The Dublin Institute of Technology colleges are very appreciative of that relationship which has been very fruitful. However, now that we are in the process of legislating for these colleges which will bring them into post-Maastricht Europe and into the 21st century we must enable them to stand shoulder to shoulder with the universities and I have no doubts about their capacity to do so.  I fail to see why we cannot provide clearly and <Col N="892" /> specifically in the Bill that these colleges should be entitled to award degrees in their own right.  People may ask what is so mysterious or meritorious about a degree.  Although it should not be, the fact is that one has to explain in another country that a diploma qualification is equivalent to the degree.  When it gets to the stage that one has to explain the qualification, it is cause for concern and there is need to focus sharply on the rights of these colleges to confer degrees in their own right.  If the standard of material being examined, and level of achievement being attained, is sufficient for validation by a university I cannot see why do we do not take a quantum leap now and put matters right once and for all.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea made a good point about ministerial amendment No. 2 which provides that subsection (2) (a) be amended by inserting after &ldquo;other functions&rdquo; the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;,which may include the function of conferring degrees, postgraduate degrees and honorary awards&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It appears the Minister is taking on board the basic thrust of our amendment which the colleges are trying to have incorporated in the Bill, but, as Deputy O'Shea said, this is sloppy drafting.  I exhort the Minister to take on board the amendments we tabled.  I submit that the appropriate place for this ministerial amendment is at section 5 (1) (b) which will state:</P>
    <P>... to confer, grant or give degrees, diplomas or certificates.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, why not go the whole way now?  He should state why the language is being couched in conservative terms such as &ldquo;may include&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall include&rdquo;.  Surely the colleges have proved themselves and if their qualifications are deemed worthy of the imprimatur of Trinity College it is obvious that they should be able to award their own degrees.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) (a) states: &ldquo;The Institute shall have such other functions as may be assigned to it, from time to time ...&rdquo; It is proposed to amend this to state:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" />
    </P>
    <P>The Institute shall have such other functions, which may include the function of conferring degrees, post-graduate degrees and honorary awards as may be assigned to it, from time to time, by order made by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>While the colleges do not need anybody to concur with them when awarding diplomas or certificates, we are now providing that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; with the concurrence of two Ministers confer a degree.  I do not know what the Minister for Finance has to do with conferring a degree or diploma although I see that he would have a role with regard to property rights and so on.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Minister to take on board in the spirit of our amendments the legitimate aspirations of the colleges to confer degrees.</P>

      <P>First, I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for your expression of kind wishes.  May I express my thanks to my colleagues on the other side of the House and add a special thanks to the Minister of State at my Department,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> Deputy Aylward, who has done a superb job to date?  His advice has been of invaluable assistance to me.  Rumours of an early by-election in Dublin South can be discounted.</P>
    <P>I have come some way towards meeting the concerns of Deputies J. Higgins and O'Shea.  The point of disagreement is about the mechanism as it is clearly the intention of the Government and I that the Dublin Institute of Technology Colleges will award degrees.  However, we differ on the timing and the mechanism by which we do that.  I would argue that I have gone halfway towards doing that. While not doing it immediately in the Bill, I have cleared up the ambiguity by putting forward amendments Nos. 22 and 23 which clarify the intention that degrees may be awarded.  I accept that not having done so up to now could have caused confusion because section 5 (1) (b) specifies awards other than degree awards. The amendments will provide that the functions of conferring degrees, post-graduate degrees and honorary awards may be included.</P>
    <P>Having listened to Deputies, I do not see any reason for a major delay in extending to the Dublin Institute of Technology degree-awarding functions.  We are not doing something casual; we are formally establishing and putting in place a major new national institution, arguably the largest third level institution in the State.  It is important to do that carefully. I am anxious that the structures be put in place, that the necessary appointments be made and that there be consultation with the people appointed.  My hope and my target would be that within 12 months of the coming into effect of the legislation I would be in a position to move in regard to the degree-awarding function.</P>
    <P>I would argue that this goes a long way to meet the requirements of Deputies opposite.  I share the spirit of confidence which they have expressed in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  By getting the structures up and running and by targetting, we might get this done within 12 months or so of the coming into effect of the legislation.  It will be all the sweeter <Col N="895" /> for the Dublin Institute of Technology to have that function added to their powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept in good faith what the Minister has said but I do not have to point out that we are dealing with legislation.  I submit that the Bill if amended as the Minister proposes will be somewhat sloppy.  He states that it is his clear intention within 12 months to grant the degree-conferring function to the Dublin Institute of Technology but, with respect, that is an intention.  We do not know what Government will be in office in 12 months' time.  The legislation will be in place when this Bill is passed.  The Minister is indicating his goodwill but I am concerned that section 5 (1) (b) still excludes the awarding of degrees as one of the main functions of the college. Section 5 (2) (a) refers to the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  While it is important that the finances of the State are kept in order, too restrictive a stranglehold by the Department of Finance on the academic development of institutions and on their ability to move into new areas of independence is a matter which should concern the Minister for Education. I am not happy about the conflict within this section.  I would be happier if the Minister would indicate on Report Stage that the whole section would be looked at again, particularly in the context of sections 5 (1) (b) and 5 (2) (a) as he proposes to amend them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the spirit of what the Minister is saying and I welcome the assurance that he envisages a timescale of one year.  Deputy O'Shea has validly pointed out that things can change utterly.  Much has changed in the past year.  When the Minister was at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications he hardly thought he would be piloting through this Bill and the Bill dealing with the regional technical colleges.  Many changes have been made to these two Bills.  Amendments to the original regional technical college Bill were introduced by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Davern, and then the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> Minister's own controversial amendments were presented <i>in absentia</i> on 3 June and subsequent amendments on 10 June.  Undertakings were given subsequently, again <i>in absentia,</i> that further restoration of the rights of vocational education committees would be countenanced on Report Stage by certain people.  I accept the sincerity and the spirit of the assurance that within a year the colleges will have the right to confer their own degrees.  That is very welcome but I would submit that this should be inserted in the Bill as part of subsection 5 (1) (b).  We are not anxious to put this to a vote but we would ask the Minister to consider this point before Report Stage, bearing in mind that this legislation will be permanent.  In section 5 (2) (a) we would prefer the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to be deleted and the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    <P>Regarding the right to award degrees in a year's time, does the Minister intend to sever altogether the link with Trinity? Will it still obtain for existing courses?  Is the Minister talking about partial retention of that link or phasing it out?  Will the colleges be fully autonomous degree-awarding institutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Minister back to active service and I join in the compliments paid to the Minister of State.  I would agree with the points made by Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Higgins in relation to the awarding of degrees by the Dublin Institute of Technology.  There is a contradiction between section 5 (1) (b) as it stands and section 5 (2) (a) as it will be when amended.  Section 5 (1) (b) explicitly excludes degree awarding as a function of the institute, while section 5 (2) (a) will include it, but only at the discretion for the Minister of Education and with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister states that it is his intention to implement this within 12 months.  If that is the intention, I do not see any reason for excluding it in section 5 (1) (b).  It would not in any way change the intention of the Minister if he agreed that the Dublin Institute of Technology may award degrees if it is his intention to <Col N="897" /> make an order allowing them to do so within 12 months.  It would settle everybody's mind if that could be built into the legislation.  I do not see any good reason, if that is the intention, it cannot be included in the legislation in the first place.  If it were included it would avoid any uncertainty and would strengthen the status and position of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I support the points made by Deputies O'Shea and Jim Higgins that if the Minister is not disposed to agreeing to the amendment this evening he would give an indication of possible agreement to it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to extend my good wishes to the Minister and welcome him back to the House.  I hope he will make every effort to ensure that those Bills will be processed speedily and uninterrupted through the House and I give him a guarantee that, to that end, he will have co-operation from this side of the House.  It will be a job well done if we allow the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional colleges to proceed with their work without there being any cloud of uncertainty hanging over them.  I hope there will be no interruptions and no delay in regard to Report Stages of these Bills.  We all agree that the Dublin Institute of Technology should have the right to confer their own degrees, and I welcome the intentions of the Minister in that regard.  However, it would be far more logical to insert it in section 5 (1) (b) rather than in a later part of the section.  As there is so little between us on this issue, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this point.  We all welcome the fact that this power will be given in a year but why wait a year because sometimes in political terms a year is a long time?  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this amendment and for the sake of co-operation on all sides of the House to include it in subsection (1) (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Gilmore and Ahearn for their kind wishes which I appreciate.  Deputy Gilmore's question is an important one.  He is asking <Col N="898" /> me to exclude from section 5 (1) (b) the words, &ldquo;other than degree awards&rdquo;.  I am actually proposing to remove those words &mdash; not perhaps the way the Deputy wants it &mdash; by means of my amendment No. 13 and substitute, &ldquo;excluding degrees other than degrees provided for by order under subsection (2) (b)&rdquo;.  Clearly, that removes the contradiction but it leaves the power with the Minister who may or may not give that authority.  It takes away that rather bald phrase &ldquo;other than degree awards&rdquo; and reconciles it with the amendment I am proposing.  From a legislative point of view, and to avoid contradiction, I am satisfied that the amendment ties up section 5 (1) (b).</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins asked me about the Trinity College link.  It is probably unnecessary to link with Trinity College in the event that the Dublin Institute of Technology are awarding their own degrees.  Under the provisions of section 5 (1) (c) it will be open to the Dublin Institute of Technology to make arrangements with other bodies, and that includes Trinity College, in the matter of awards but that would be purely a matter for the Dublin Institute of Technology themselves.  My amendments Nos. 13, 22, 23, 24 and 70 seek to bring the day of degree awarding closer.  The reference to the Minister for Finance in subsection (2) (b) is a standard one in any case where the Minister for Finance may feel there was additional expenditure involved.  At first glance it may not seem that additional expenditure is involved when a new function is awarded to a college but experience has shown that that can very often be the case.  I would not read too much into the phrase &ldquo;with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;: it is meant purely as a checking mechanism on public expenditure and has not caused difficulty in previous legislation that I am aware of.  If the sponsoring Minister is anxious to proceed with it, it is by way of a formality unless there are major expenditure implications which I could not see being the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress that I am not reluctant to award the degree giving powers to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  With a <Col N="899" /> full Dublin Institute of Technology governing body, a chairperson, a president and a whole new organisation being launched, they would have no difficulty in winning that final recognition which will be available to them under the legislation in as short a time as possible.  I have mentioned 12 months as a target.  I do not foresee circumstances in which they would not be able to win that confidence. The individual colleges are not new but overall we are talking of a new institution.  If you look at other examples throughout the country you will see it has taken them many years to reach their full maturity and to win the final accolade of being able to award degrees.  It is probably a cautionary step, it is not a major withholding.  I think the Dublin Institute of Technology will win the confidence of whatever Minister or Government is in office.  I cannot foresee them having much difficulty in doing that but it is important to be able to discuss how that might happen with the Dublin Institute of Technology governing body, with the new chairperson and president and to bring it into effect in a more orderly fashion.  I will give some consideration to the points raised by Deputies between now and Report Stage but at this point I am sticking with the amendments I have submitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am somewhat at a loss to understand why Dublin Institute of Technology should be kept temporarily on the leash &mdash; albeit for a year.  They have proved themselves.  We are now gelling them into a new form, a new shape.  I find it difficult to accept that they cannot be given their full wings at this stage.  What kind of mechanism does the Minister envisage giving them in a year's time?  Presumably, and we are talking about the year 1993-94, the entrants to the colleges in September 1993 can look forward to competing for degree awards conferred by the colleges themselves. Once the Bill is enacted does the Minister envisage his Department having regular consultations with the governing body of the new institute over the period <Col N="900" /> so that he would be ready, if they are determined to be of a sufficient standard, to give them their degree award winning status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely it.  I do not want to be disrespectful to a very fine organisation but I think they will earn their degree awarding status in the next 12 months or so.  I have little doubt they can earn that.  There is always a slight possibility that, for some reason, they may be unable to earn that final step but I have full confidence that they will be able to do so.  During that period I intend to have discussions and to target the entrants at the end of 1993 as being the first participants.  That earning process is a short one but an important one if for no other reason than to allow full consultation with the new team in place in the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer this discussion goes on the more concerned I am becoming about this issue.  We have a situation where the Dublin Institute of Technology already have arrangements with Trinity College for the awarding of degrees.  That is provided for in section 5 (1) (c), and presumably it will remain. It will also be the case that the Dublin Institute of Technology can have arrangements with the NCEA for the awarding of degrees.  If the Dublin Institute of Technology consider that a particular course should be pursued for an NCEA degree they can, in the normal way, submit the proposal to the NCEA, have it validated and so on.  We are discussing whether the Dublin Institute of Technology will be in a position to award their own degrees.  The Minister spoke about the Dublin Institute of Technology earning the right to award degrees and said that over the period of a year and following discussions with the Dublin Institute of Technology he would be able to assess whether they could do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two issues arise in this regard.  As Deputy Higgins has quite rightly said, we are dealing with an institution which for all practical purposes have been in exist- <Col N="901" /> ence for a very long time and have earned their spurs.  The second issue that arises, with all due respect, is the Minister's competence in assessing whether or not the Dublin Institute of Technology are in a position to award their own degrees. The Dublin Institute of Technology are a body which will have their own academic council, their own governing body and very fine academic staff.  I am at a loss to understand what the Minister's position is in regard to assessing that a particular course of studies should have a degree awarded by the Dublin Institute of Technology. It seems to me that the Minister is effectively setting up himself and his Department as a validating body for degrees.  That is a completely new and very dangerous development because, quite honestly &mdash; and I say this with the greatest respect &mdash; the Minister is not in a position to determine whether or not the institute should award a degree. Surely that is a question on which academic people, whether in the college or outside it, would be in the best position to judge.</P>
    <P>If the decision is not to be based on academic criteria, I wonder if it is to be based on some other kind of criteria.  For example, might it be that if the Dublin Institute of Technology reach the conclusion that they should be allowed to award a degree for a particular course, the Minister could decide &mdash; probably in consultation with the Minister for Finance &mdash; that for reasons other than academic reasons, perhaps ones based on finance, the institute cannot award the degree?  Such an intention would constitute gross interference in the academic freedom of the college.  That is an aspect that I am quite worried about and I hope the Minister will be able to resolve the issue on Report Stage.  However, the longer the discussion goes on the more concerned I am that there is more to this than meets the eye.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">

      <P>The Minister clearly said that he expects the colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology to earn the privilege of awarding degrees.  I wish to point out that already those colleges <Col N="902" /> award 15 degrees.  I cannot understand why the Minister would say at this stage that they have to prove themselves.  The 15 courses to which I refer have been examined and scrutinised and degrees are awarded through Trinity College.  Those courses have been approved and have received much recognition.  Would the Minister not agree that in relation to those 15 courses the colleges should be given the right to award degrees?  What would have to be proven in relation to those courses?  Already degrees are awarded, the tuition is of an excellent standard and the colleges have received due recognition.  Perhaps the Minister could justify his case by saying that he will give the colleges a year to prove themselves on the awarding of new degrees.  I have no doubt that they would prove themselves able for the task.  Certainly in relation to the 15 courses for which degrees are already awarded I cannot understand why there would be a delay and why the Dublin Institute of Technology should be asked to prove themselves.  The Minister and the Department of Education should give the colleges the recognition they deserve by allowing the Dublin Institute of Technology to award their own degrees for the 15 courses in which they have already proved themselves.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Gilmore, I develop more misgivings about the direction in which this amendment is heading as the debate progresses.  For the moment we should reflect on the macro-scene in the sense that demographic trends show a smaller intake into our national schools. That trend has been evident for some years and, before very long, will be experienced in second level and third level institutions.  The previous Minister for Education decided that ESF grants for the new intake shall be means-tested on the same basis as higher education grants from September next.  That decision will have the effect of moving marginal students in the direction of the universities.  In other words, pupils who qualify for a particular certificate or diploma course at a regional technical college <Col N="903" /> or the Dublin Institute of Technology and also have available to them a place in a university course, will decide to avail of the university course if it transpires that they will no longer qualify for an ESF grant on the basis of their parents' income.  Earlier Deputy Higgins referred to the perception of degrees in our society.  It is my belief that the perception of degrees is such that the movement towards universities will be a very definite trend.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the debate the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, was prepared to accept an amendment to section 5 (1) to include apprentice training along with vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State in the functions of the institute.  The Minister left me with the impression that the area of apprentice and craft technician education was under review in the post-Culliton era.</P>
      <P>I fear that if we place an emphasis on apprenticeship training we may lose sight of apprentice education, which is more important in many ways.  People can be trained in technical skills and the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges have done a marvellous job in improving the level of technician in Ireland.  Irish technicians are in strong demand overseas, for example, I instance our Telecom and ESB technicians.  The improvement of technical education is probably the greatest development in education in the history of this State and the Dublin Institute of Technology and regional technical colleges are to be greatly complimented on that.  I am afraid that apprentices might be viewed as people who are trained and for whom there is no need to provide a wider basis for study to include liberal education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the structure of education in this country is such that the inclusion in the Bill of a provision that gives the Minister powers to do something if he so desires, with the constraint of consultation with the Minister for Finance, will result in decisions coming out in <Col N="904" /> favour of the universities as against degree courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  My argument is given greater force by the letter to vocational education committee chief executive officers that emanated from the Department of Education in the middle of May. The letter stated that the Department were becoming concerned that regional technical colleges were to some extent moving away from the basic mandate of certificates and diplomas and that the Department were receiving many fresh applications for the approval of degree courses.  The letter stated that the Department envisaged a figure of 10 per cent of students who attended regional technical colleges pursuing degree courses. At present 30 per cent of students attending the Dublin Institute of Technology are pursuing degree courses.</P>
    <P>In that context and when we look at what is happening outside this Chamber in relation to the debate on this Bill, there are many markers and signs &mdash; in saying that I do not question the good faith or sincerity of the Minister &mdash; which lead me to believe that he could very well be frustrated, if indeed his Government are still in power over the next 12 months, in delivering on the commitment which he gave here tonight, that it was his objective that degree-conferring powers would be placed in the hands of the Dublin Institute of Technology over a 12-month period.  I understand the context in which the phrase &ldquo;earning the right to do so&rdquo; was used and I take it in the spirit in which it was meant.  However, the Department of Finance are reviewing the functions of the Department of Education and the whole degree provision in the entire third level sector.  The training colleges will now become absorbed in the universities but, if we look at the reality of what has been happening in relation to the Department of Education, it is obvious that it will prove extremely difficult for any Minister to deliver in 12 months on the degree conferring which the Dublin Institute of Technology justifiably seek and should have.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister was not in <Col N="905" /> office when the Bill was drafted and indeed two previous Ministers dealt with it.  Why should the conferring of degrees, post-graduate awards and other higher education awards be excluded from the Bill?  The Dublin Institute of Technology will be contracting in relation to the 5,000 apprentices with whom they deal.  Is it credible that the Departments of Education and Finance will allow the extension of the degree provision in the Dublin Institute of Technology?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the concerns expressed by other Deputies, particularly the points raised by Deputy O'Shea.  When the question of apprentice training was raised the Minister of State assured us that &ldquo;training&rdquo; meant &ldquo;apprentice training&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister agrees that that is the case although the word &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; is not mentioned. The question arises of apprentice education versus training, and the fact that it is under the aegis of the Department of Labour does not give us any assurance on that score.  However, we are dealing here with the issue of degrees and every subsection states: &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;. That is stated about 15 times on the page. subsection (2) (a), which will permit degree awards in due course, was not intended in the original draft to allow powers to grant degrees, although it is now being used for that purpose.  Subsection (2) (a) states:</P>
      <P>The Institute shall have such other functions as may be assigned to it, from time to time, by order made by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has the authority in every other section and subsection of the Bill but, in this case, it is subject to the concurrence of the Minister for Finance which, of course, in current circumstances and indeed in the last decade, means that there are huge levels of debt, no money and constant cutbacks.  In those circumstances, the concurrence of the Minister for Finance is very unlikely if it means an increase in expenditure. He will give his concurrence if whatever <Col N="906" /> the Minister suggests will not lead to an increase in expenditure from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The increase in the powers of the Minister and his interference in almost every aspect of the colleges &mdash; and the exclusion of the vocational education committees from every aspect of college life &mdash; is the most dangerous part of the Bill and is very worrying.  We would all like to know what is in the Green Paper, if there will be a White Paper, a Bill and an Act.  We understand that a Green Paper has not been prepared and that there will not be a White Paper.  Therefore, the whole education system is in flux; nobody knows what is in the minds of the Minister's Department.  When discussing a Bill of such major importance to the third level sector, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges, we would love to know what the future holds in store.  Where are we going?  Will the 1930 Act be abolished? Where are we going in primary, second and third level education?</P>

      <P>I am specifically dealing with the powers of the Minister which are mentioned in the subsection. When powers are given to the Minister we would like to know his policy.  What is the policy of the Department, at least in third level education?  We would like to know that when discussing an amendment which gives the Minister specific powers to allow degrees.  That is a vital factor in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  They want the power to award degrees and the Minister can decide what degrees they will be allowed to award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Minister so reluctant to allow the Dublin Institute of Technology off the leash?  They have built up a great reputation abroad as well as at home, and are already awarding degrees as well as diplomas and certificates.  Why must the Minister interfere in the running of <Col N="907" /> the colleges and the areas of awarding degrees?  Where does the Minister stand in relation to democracy in the education system?  Under Deputy O'Rourke, we thought there would be more freedom not only in the vocational education sector but also in all other sectors with the advent of local education authorities etc., but that is no longer the case.  Is the Minister centralising all the power in his own hands?  The point I am trying to make is that this question is coming to the fore again on this subsection.  What is even worse in this case is that the approval of the Minister for Finance must also be sought.  As a member of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, knowing the tremendous developments that have taken place in recent years in the Dublin Institute of Technology and their potential if given the freedom to proceed in the area of research without interference from the Minister, I believe this matter must be pressed to the limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions have been raised and I will try to deal with them as succinctly as I can.  In reply to those Deputies who have raised questions in relation to my target of 12 months, I repeat that we are not doing something minor but establishing a new, integrated institution.  A major reorganisation will take place and there will be a new governing body with a new chairman.  In addition, there will be a need to discuss with them their proposals and suggestions with regard to the question of quality assurance and external examiners of international standing.  Following those discussions the governing body and the chairman and President, as well as the Department of Education, have to be satisfied that the time is right to take the final step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that it will be a matter of judgement and readily admit that the Deputies' judgment could be as good as mine in this regard but I am satisfied that it is better to adopt this more cautious approach.  Incidentally, the new governing body will include students and <Col N="908" /> staff representatives, not possible at present.  We will now have an opportunity to discuss how we should proceed with all those interests.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore wondered if the Department of Education would become a validation body.  I can understand his concern.  However, it took the two NIHEs in Limerick and Dublin many years to win the power to grant degrees and the Government of the day took the decision to confer university status on them.  In doing so the Government were not deciding to validate the degrees.  It was their normal function to come to a conclusion, following discussion, that a certain institution should proceed to degree status.  Therefore it is nothing new for a Government to bring on an institution in that way until it reaches the final stage.  That is what I want to do in the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I am determined to ensure that it will have degree status and award quality degrees. It is appropriate therefore to put the structure in place and to discuss with them how we should proceed.  That is the sensible and practical way to proceed.  As a matter of courtesy to the new institutions, I will do it in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahearn referred to the existing degrees.  I understand that Trinity College have a role to play in this regard.  To an extent, therefore, that is a separate matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to the figure of 10 per cent.  The purpose of the letter was to commence a discussion on the balance as between certificates, diplomas and degrees.  The colleges and the NCEA have been asked to outline their views. My objective is to relieve the Department of the responsibility for course approval. I suggested the figure of 10 per cent merely as a guideline as this represents the average across the sector.  I should say that no percentage has been mooted for the Dublin Institute of Technology as I recognise that their position is entirely different.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Mac Giolla, I recognise the value of apprenticeships and support the comments made by the Minister of State in that regard and share <Col N="909" /> his analysis.  The Dublin Institute of Technology provide off-the-job education and training for many apprentices. As the House can see, this Bill will allow us to continue in this way and students benefit from third level education.  A specific reference is, however, unnecessary over and above the references to technical education and training.</P>
    <P>Let me make one or two comments in reply to Deputy Mac Giolla on the Green Paper.  I should tell the House that this morning the Government approved the final draft of the Green Paper and it will be published in full next Thursday afternoon.  I published at the end of April an introduction to the Green Paper.  I was satisfied that my philosophy and thinking was reflected clearly in that document.  If the Deputy does not think so, he may be convinced when he has an opportunity to read the Green Paper in full on Thursday evening.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Bill and the Green Paper, I believe my philosophy is quite clear.  I have the height of respect and always have had for the vocational education committees and for the local authorities, having served as a member of one, but we cannot have it both ways. If we are going to give power and authority to the boards of management and governing bodies we cannot withold it.  The philosophy in the Green Paper is to take power from the Department of Education, from the Government, from the other institutions and give it clearly and crisply to the governing bodies of the colleges.  I said to the vocational education committees, to the religious orders and to my Department that all of us will have to cede power, influence and authority to the boards of management.  We cannot double think on this approach to education.  The various bodies, including the vocational education committees, the Department of Education and the religious orders, should stand back and devolve power to the governing bodies.  This will amount to democracy, as the boards of management and the governing bodies will be made up of students, teachers, vocational education committee nominees, business <Col N="910" /> people, local community representatives and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do indeed.  I will come to that in a moment.  That is clearly outlined in the Green Paper.  We have to make up our minds.  Do we want the vocational education committees, the Department of Education and the religious orders to retain control or do we want to give this power to the governing bodies and the boards of management? The boards of management, the parents and teachers all want to know the answer to this question.  Do we want to fudge the issue and pretend that everybody has a bit of power with no one having final responsibility?</P>
      <P>For my part, I have clearly stated in the Green Paper that the Minister will be giving up that authority.  The view was expressed frequently during the course of the debate on Second Stage and Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned it again this evening, that the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo; appears too many times in the Bill.  I think Deputies are right.  I propose therefore, in amendments Nos. 9, 16, 18, 19, and 21, to remove that phrase from the following subparagraphs of section 5 (1): (a) (e), (g), (h) and (j), and from as many other sections as practicable. Obviously, this will take time.</P>
      <P>I have invited the Irish Vocational Education Association to meet me. Unfortunately, they were unable to do so this week but I hope they will be available next week, or as soon as possible. I propose to point out to them that they have a very good, solid role to play in the future of Irish education.  But are they really saying to me that nothing has changed since 1930, when the Act was introduced establishing the vocational education committees?  Are they really saying to me that they wish to hold on to the power and not devolve it to the governing bodies?  If that is what they are saying, I should like to hear them say it clearly.</P>

I want to thank the Minister for dropping the reference to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; in so many places but it is still retained in some significant areas such as research, consultancy, development and so on.  I contend that it is in those areas the Minister should drop out and that the vocational education committees and democracy should remain.</P>

      <P>On the question of degree-awarding I want to remind the Minister that the colleges which constitute the Dublin Institute of Technology were in existence long before the NIHE, Limerick, as it was then, or the NIHE, Dublin, as it was initially.  I hope I do not stand to be corrected on this but I think the colleges that constitute the Dublin Institute of Technology were actually the first of the non-university sector colleges to secure degree level status for some of their courses.  I think they had secured that through Trinity College some time before the NIHE, Limerick, secured something similar from the National University <Col N="912" /> of Ireland and before the NIHE, Dublin was up and running.  Therefore we are dealing with colleges that are not new to the circumstances but which have had many years of experience and skill behind them.  I do not think they have to prove themselves at all in this area.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 25, to delete section 5 (4), would the Minister say what is the reason for this deletion?  Also from the point of view of the comprehensive section itself, which is really the nub of what the Bill is about, the conferring of additional powers which we discussed in detail in relation to qualifications, there is, in addition, the conferring of the right on the colleges to fulfil a vital function <Col N="915" /> denied them to date &mdash; when some of the Dublin colleges suffered considerable financial loss &mdash; that is power to engage in research, consultancy and development work.  That is why we on this side of the House look on this as something which will give those colleges the type of sharp edge they require to go out and compete in the very lucrative marketplace.</P>
      <P>I am particularly conscious that in recent years their brothers and sisters in the other colleges, the NUI colleges, and the former NIHE colleges in Glasnevin and Limerick, have carved out for themselves extremely valuable niches in terms of liaison and joint enterprise with industry. The whole area of research, consultancy, marketing and training facilities is a very lucrative one, literally running into millions of pounds.  If one takes the example of University College, Dublin, one sees that they have managed to involve themselves in quite a number of extremely lucrative research and development projects.</P>
      <P>We know, for example, that one of the banes of the agricultural community is the threat of mastitis and that annually £35 million is spent endeavouring to combat that disease.  University College, Dublin, in their research and development, have come up with quite a number of very useful patents which have gone a long way in this regard.  We know that 13 companies have passed through their innovative centre, that their marketing and development programme, which has been in place since 1982, has helped more than 600 national and international companies in relation to solving marketing problems, getting involved in marketing issues, farming the graduates out to various companies so they can come back immersed in the type of experience required for the marketplace.</P>

      <P>I am not doing so, Sir, I am dealing with section 5 (1) (d) and (e) in relation to the new powers we are conferring on the colleges to involve themselves in consultancy work and in research and development.</P>
      <P>Within a stone's throw of here we have Trinity College, Dublin, perhaps the best known university in Europe.  After the festivities of a number of weeks ago, it certainly is the best known university in Europe.  Any of us who has had the pleasure of being in the O'Reilly Institute there will be aware that it generates about £8 million in external research per year. How wonderful it would be if the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges had access to that type of funding.  We welcome this Bill because it opens the door to them to become involved in similar type enterprise.  For example, the O'Reilly Institute has been involved not alone in promoting national companies but companies from America, Germany, France, the UK and Japan and shortly they are to become involved in a well-known Korean company.  They have managed to tap into European Commission funding of £2 million in contracts per year.</P>
      <P>There was a project on the way to one of the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges a number of years ago but, because of the strictures and restraints on them from becoming involved in this type of work, it went to University College, Cork.  Full marks to Cork for being opportunistic enough to pick up the pieces.  It is estimated that over 200 jobs have been created because of the industrial liaison programme in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the feather in the cap of all the universities has been the NIHE in Limerick.  We have had some disagreements in relation to the role of that college and the lack of respect for the humanities, yet Limerick, Galway and all these colleges are playing an invaluable role in research and development.  That is why I welcome this section, apart from the fact that the Minister has signposted <Col N="917" /> his intention to allow the Dublin Institute of Technology to confer degrees.  It is to be hoped this other very important dimension will be exploited in full by the colleges themselves.</P>

      <P>I emphasise that, as mentioned already, the section in regard to research, consultancy and development work is of vital importance to the Dublin Institute of Technology. That is the only section in which the Minister has retained the provision &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  What is the reason for that in that case?  It was amended in all the other sections.  The colleges themselves should have total freedom and flexibility in the area of research, consultancy and development.  Why does the Minister retain his power in that subsection and drop all the others graciously here for us?  This is an area where the colleges have been inhibited to some degree and have only just begun in the past few years to expand their whole role in research, consultancy, joint ventures etc.</P>
      <P>I would also like to know what changed the mind of the Minister or the Department to make them drop subsection 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced to the House it was on the basis that it would provide for much more autonomy for the institute in terms of its day to day management and provide for the institute to become involved in research and development work.  Section 5 (1) (d) and (f) are the two subsections in which the Minister has retained the phrase &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine.&rdquo;  As I said earlier in the debate, I see the logic in this. The legal implications of becoming involved in research and development are obvious.  Research and development can go wrong.  Who picks up the tab in that case?  If an R and D project goes very well and there is a very large earning <Col N="918" /> from it, who will benefit at the end of the day?</P>
      <P>I would like to draw to the Minister's attention one phrase in section 5 (1) (a). As now amended it will read: &ldquo;to provide such courses of study as the Governing body considers appropriate, and such other courses as the Minister may from time to time direct;&rdquo; As the Minister responded to the debate on this section he spoke in terms of whether we are serious about devolving power.</P>
      <P>To use the &ldquo;in&rdquo; phrase in the Maastricht context, are we serious about subsidiarity? I suggest that to a fair extent the Minister is speaking tongue in cheek. Like it or not, the real read of this section is about centralising power and authority in Marlborough Street.  If the Government were really serious in terms of providing more autonomy for the colleges in their day-to-day management and their freedom to become involved in research. and development and consultancy work, simple amendments to the 1930 Act would have achieved that.  I believe the strategy is much more basic and deeper and, runs contrary to what the Minister is telling us now will be the theme of the Green Paper, so I do not see that this is giving power to the people. I believe it is strengthening the power of the Department and of the Minister at the expense of democratically elected people who have served on, in this case the Dublin vocational education committee and, in the case of the regional technical college Bill, vocational education committees throughout the country. There is a basic rule that should be followed; if something works, why change it?  Why not simply make it more efficient.  By all means let us implement the principle of subsidiarity.  That is a vital and fundamental principle, not alone in education but throughout society at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, I suggest to the Minister that the amendments made to this section in their overall effect would be much more cosmetic than real.  It brings us back <Col N="919" /> to a question asked many times here during the debate: Why the great hurry to get these two Bills through and passed into law before the Green Paper is published, before the wide-ranging debate on education at first, second and third levels takes place and before the people we want to devolve power to &mdash; the parents, students and so on &mdash; have had a chance to feed back in real detail to the Department of Education their views in the whole area of third level education, be it university, regional colleges or the Dublin Institute of Technology? I still hold the view strongly that this Bill defends a position for the Department of Education and for the Minister and does not make the principle of subsidiarity any stronger in our society; I believe the effect will be the opposite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken out of a number of paragraphs the requirement that the various functions of the institute would be performed subject to conditions determined by the Minister.  It seems that prior to that the only thing the institute were allowed do without the approval of the Minister was to accept gifts, for example, money, land and so on; they would not have to look for ministerial approval if someone gave them something for nothing.  However, I am curious as to why the Minister has retained this requirement in regard to the functions relating to research, consultancy and development work, and their involvement in limited companies and joint ventures of various kinds.  I should like the Minister to explain this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the involvement of the institute in research and development work and their involvement with outside bodies such as limited companies and so on, is it the Minister's intention to make general regulations or lay down general conditions which will apply to the institute's activities in those areas or does he intend that on each occasion an opportunity <Col N="920" /> arises for the institute to engage in that type of work they will have to seek ministerial approval?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a keen interest in the area of competition.  I am sure he will be aware that opportunities for research and development work which arise are sought after by many institutions and that this is a very competitive area. It would be wrong if the Dublin Institute of Technology were put at a competitive disadvantage with regard to other institutions or had to seek ministerial approval for any opportunity which would arise, something other institutions may not have to do.  I am not clear as to why the Minister has retained the proviso and should like him to clarify his intentions. Does he intend to lay down some general conditions which would be known to the institute in advance and with which they would have to comply when pursuing research and development opportunities or does he intend that each time an opportunity arises the institute will have to seek for ministerial approval?</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins asked why I was deleting subsection &mdash; (4).  This subsection is no longer relevant in the sense that as it stands it vests the land in the vocational education committee.  As the Deputy is aware, this land is now being vested in the colleges.  This subsection is no longer relevant as it says, &ldquo;shall be held by that committee...&rdquo;. The deletion of this subsection is consequential on the decision to transfer the property from the vocational education committee to the colleges.  I regard this as a sign of my confidence in the governing bodies and my determination to devolve real authority and power to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is arguable.  It has been said many times that Marlbor- <Col N="921" /> ough Street has to give more authority to governing bodies; so too have the vocational education committees.  If I do not give them more authority I am merely paying lip service to the future strength of governing bodies.  I feel very strongly about this.  The same applies to religious orders.  We have to give the governing bodies the authority and not pretend to give it to them and do nothing.  One cannot give power to organisations without diluting the power of some other body.  This power currently resides substantially in the Department of Education, the vocational education committees and the religious orders.  If we are to give powers to the colleges then those three centres will have to share their power with the governing bodies of colleges and schools.  No doubt this is a theme I will repeat many times during the discussion on the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to research and consultancy work.  I am glad Deputies welcome my decision to remove the requirement of ministerial approval from many of the sections.  Having listened carefully to what Deputy O'Shea said, I wish to indicate my willingness to remove this requirement from subsection (1) (a). I am happy to remove the words, &ldquo;such other courses as the Minister may direct&rdquo;, from this paragraph.  I do this to show that I am consistent in my determination to give authority to the governing body and to have ministerial involvement only in areas where it might be necessary for the moment to ensure a smooth transition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I retained this requirement in regard to consultancy, research and development work is that when I was in my previous ministry I was dragged into this House on many occasions and asked why I did not keep better control on some semi-State companies and why I allowed subsidiary companies to wander around the world and commit Irish taxpayer's money.  I was asked if I was aware that, for example, subsidiary company No. 52 of a major national semi-State body was <Col N="922" /> trading in a certain country and committing vast sums of Irish taxpayers' money and if they were brought before the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if a university project or a campus company engaged in, for example, the construction of offices or apartments, or some commercial work went spectacularly down the tubes, every Deputy would queue up to table questions to the Minister for Education asking what controls he had on the institution, why did he not make it his business to inquire into the exposure of the company and so on.  They would be correct to do that.  However, we cannot have it both ways.  If third level institutions are to get involved in commercial work and the Minister of the day is to be called before the House to account for any disasters which might occur in that area then I have to include a provision which provides that he has to give some approval to that work.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be negative, and I wish the colleges well.  Many of them are doing very well at present.  I visited Kevin Street College of Technology, and UCG, which both Deputy Gilmore and I attended, and saw at first hand the very fine work being done.  I wish them well and will give them every encouragement.  The only involvement the Minister will have will be in the laying down of general guidelines.  He will not have an involvement in regard to specific companies or consultancy assignments; he will lay down general guidelines to protect taxpayers' money.  I do not regard this as anything other than a safety net; I do not regard it as meddling.  To be blunt, when I had responsibility for semi-State companies, I learned the hard way about the responsibility of Ministers for their activities.  I feel that same sense of responsibility in regard to third level institutions.  I trust that none of these institutions will have any difficulty.  They will get every support from my Department. Given that we are in largely unchartered waters, it would be as well if <Col N="923" /> the Minister was at least aware of the types of activities in which they should become involved and laid down general guidelines.</P>
    <P>The second reason I am retaining this proviso is to avoid duplication.  Research work is extraordinarily expensive; we are talking about multi-million pound projects.  It makes no sense for two institutions a few miles apart to be engaged in the same multi-million pound research project.  It makes total sense for the Department, on receiving information about similar projects in similar institutions, to try to pull them together and avoid unnecessary duplication.  This is not in any way to involve the Department or the Minister in the substantive work of research; that is not the Minister's business.  However, it is his business to ensure that there is no unnecessary duplication or risk.  That is the reason I am retaining this proviso.  It is not meddling; it is simply a safety net.  I believe it is necessary because in other public institutions Ministers were held responsible for difficulties that emerged.  Many a spectacular scandal was raised in this House in the past year or two about public companies when it was asked why the Minister did not know what was going on in certain areas.  There is no exact similarity in this case but nevertheless it is better to keep an eye on the position until we are further down the road, and there may be a time when that is not necessary.  That is already the practice in the Higher Education Authority.  In some cases commercial projects are at arm's length from the Department and the Minister and very often from the institution.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea asked about ministerial involvement.  I have already answered that question but I think the Deputy is reading the Bill wrongly as regards centralisation in Marlborough Street.  My introduction to the Green Paper specifically pointed out that a major aim of educational policy in the decades ahead is to take power away <Col N="924" /> from Marlborough Street and the Minister and to push it down the line to the lowest possible level, which is the governing body of the institution.  That would mean diluting authority for everybody else on the way down.  In this Bill I am stripping away the Minister's powers. I have taken some stick for that but I stand over it.  I have also transferred some authority from the vocational education committees to the institutions.  I would argue, therefore, that I am being totally consistent in transferring power to the governing body.</P>
    <P>I am a little amused that the Deputy accuses me of rushing through the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and the Regional Technical Colleges Bill.  These Bills were published in June 1991.  They are long overdue and should have been passed along ago.  Hopefully they have benefited from the additional consideration given to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily agree with the Minister in relation to justifying his retention of power in terms of research and development.  I can see the guiding hand of the Minister as a custodian or overseer.  However, I do not agree that if college A is doing research and development in a certain area that area should be exclusive to that college and college B, irrespective of whether it is one mile or ten miles down the road, should be precluded from involvement. Competition in education, as in all areas, is a good thing.  Competition is the life of trade.  I have no doubt about that.  I gave instances in regard to UCD, UCC, UCG and the colleges in Glasnevin and Limerick, all of which are revenue earners.  I cannot understand why, if one of the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges wants to become involved in an area in which they had not been involved up to now, they should not be allowed to become involved.  However, I can understand that the Minister may wish to retain an overseer role in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a commercial aspect to research and development but it is not <Col N="925" /> exclusively commercial.  All research and development projects should also have a learning element from the point of view of the students involved.  It should not be simply a case of somebody bringing something into the college for tests or utilising the facilities of the college; there should also be a learning element involved.  That should be one of the preconditions set down in relation to involvement in research and development because it is vital that the student body be the first concern.</P>
    <P>We welcome the section as amended by the Minister, particularly where the functions of conferring degrees, post-graduate degrees and so on, are included. I am glad the Minister has accepted this principle.  However, if the Minister is pushing the awarding of degrees down the road by a minimum of one year then as a consequence he is also pushing post-graduate awards down the road.  Post-graduate degrees and awards should take place simultaneously.  One of the areas of activity which adds lustre to third level institutions, particularly universities, is that people who have achieved levels of excellence are recognised and receive post-graduate awards.  I know it is only a frill in many cases but there is an important symbolism involved and it is a distinguishing feature.  We know that awards of particular institutions can have a certain status over and above those of sister institutions.  We hope that post-graduate awards by the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges will have a certain lustre of their own.</P>
    <P>I would point out that in relation to some post-graduate awards, from time to time doctorates have been bestowed on people from various walks of life and these people have been only too willing to put the title &ldquo;Dr. &rdquo; in front of their names on all letter headings, even though in all cases the doctorate might not have been deserved.  This again is a source of anxiety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to smile when <Col N="926" /> the Minister was telling us about the dangers that would result from colleges engaged in research.  The idea comes to mind of the Bolton Street College of Technology conducting research into the construction industry and the effect of climate on different materials in the building industry, setting up some offshore company, or building villas in Spain or Saudi Arabia, and spending millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.  I would point out to the Minister that out of all the millions of pounds which the vocational education committees handled over the years not one penny went astray.  Every committee throughout the country have a great record of commitment in regard to public finance and so on.  They would be quite competent to do the job which the Minister is retaining in this instance. They would be competent in dealing with the whole area of research and so on.  The Minister has even taken from vocational education committees the power to make recommendations.  Therefore, I feel he has a prejudice against the vocational education committees.  It is a question of granting all power to the governing bodies, but that could turn out to be quite a bad thing because governing bodies tend to think about status, how they can get one up on somebody else, improve their image or whatever.  They may not think of the public interest or of equality of opportunity in education.  The Minister makes the removal of democracy sound like a good thing.  The removal of democracy is never a good thing no matter what excuses there may be for it. It is removed by calling it bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite dangerous to remove the vocational education committee system from the structure.  The Minister should remember that constant effort has been made by vocational education committees at positive discrimination to ensure that pupils in disadvantaged areas move on to second and third level education. There has been a constant battle, certainly by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, to try to help those <Col N="927" /> pupils by setting up linkages between second level schools and third level colleges. If the Minister prevents vocational education committees from even making recommendations and suggestions to Governing bodies, he will be doing a bad job in the educational field and as far as the Culliton report is concerned.</P>
    <P>Under the present system apprentices can move on by virtue of training and craftsmanship developed to certificate and diploma courses and some have gone on to degree courses due to the encouragement and linkage from second to third level.  Giving all the power to the governing body may not be right.  On Second Stage, Deputy O'Rourke, as Minister, acknowledged that the whole question of equality of opportunity had not been mentioned in the Bill.  It is being accepted now.  The Minister must keep this area in mind and must include procedures in the Bill to ensure there is some linkage from second to third level.  At the moment that is well done by the vocational education committee system which involves the community.  Community involvement is vital because the people in an area know what their regional technical college, in this case the Dublin Institute of Technology, requires. The involvement of the community, public representatives and democratic institutions, is vital in a rapidly changing educational world.  Consideration of the need for the vocational education committees is not a curtailment of the powers of the governing bodies.  I would not want it to be seen in that way but vocational education committees have a role to play.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the undertaking given by the Minister that in subsection (1) (a) he will delete the terminology, &ldquo;and such other courses as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;, as an earnest of his good faith in terms of his commitment to the devolvement of power in the educational system. The Minister found my remark in relation <Col N="928" /> to the rushing of the Bills a little amusing, but I will not accuse either the Minister or the Government of being in a hurry with the Green Paper which was promised for last September.</P>

      <P>I was responding to points made.  I share some of the concerns of the Minister about guidelines in regard to research and development, consultancy and campus companies.  If not now, will the Minister on Report Stage give a general direction on how these campus company guidelines will be formulated? Obviously, we are talking here about limited liability companies, and with companies, comes the whole area of accountability.  Companies must be accountable.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, in the history of the vocational education committee not one penny has gone astray.  This new departure in terms of campus companies, R and D and relationships with outside agencies and institutions means there is a need for definite guidelines and a definite process of accountability.  I do not suggest that the guidelines should be draconian or that they should use &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; type terminology but they are necessary from the point of view of accountability.</P>
      <P>The speed at which the Committee Stages of these Bills is being dealt with at a time when the Green Paper is about to be published puzzles me.  The debate on the Green Paper should be as broadly based and as public as possible.  The debate on the Green Paper could illustrate that aspects of these Bills do not serve the public interest.  These Bills could have been put on ice for some time but we have to deal with them because the Government feel differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> The role of the Higher Education Authority in the universities has not been defined in this debate.  We have not discussed how their allocation is made and how they in theory, and in practice to a large extent, determine what money goes to various colleges and what activities they should pursue.  According to a recent letter from the Department to the regional technical colleges, 22 degree or postgraduate qualifications had been approved by the Higher Education Authority, but the Department chose to block them.  The Minister may say that 10 per cent is a notional figure, one that is put in in order to encourage debate but, at the end of the day, does the Minister envisage the Department giving the sector generally any more scope than that 10 per cent particularly in the developing situation which I have described, where there will be more competition between third level institutions for students?  In that context, the undertaking the Minister gave tonight of making the degree conferring function available to the Dublin Institute of Technology will be difficult to deliver.  That is the nature of things, and my experience of observing the Department makes me believe most firmly that the Department favour confining the development of degree courses to the university sector instead of developing them in the Dublin Institute of Technology and regional technical college sectors.  When we take account of the fact that the dead hand of the Minister for Finance pervades the sector, that appears to be the bottom line.</P>
    <P>The Minister asserts that I may be over-reacting to the further powers being given to the Department of Education. The Minister has been generous in some respects in amending the Bill.  However, section 5 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The principal function of the Institute shall, subject to the provisions of this Act,...</P>
    <P>There are restrictive provisions in the Bill and we will deal with some of them <Col N="930" /> tomorrow.  While the Minister has taken some measures to loosen the section he has managed to confine its effect by subjecting it to further conditions, &ldquo;as the Minister may determine.&rdquo;  There is certainly justification for guidelines but in future the third level institutes will be competing for students and that is where I see the battle &mdash; although that is the wrong word to use in the context of education &mdash; being fought.  All third level institutes will have to battle for sufficient students to maintain the staff numbers and competition will be intense.</P>
    <P>This Bill will serve to put the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges at a disadvantage in terms of attracting high achievers by providing a broader range of degree courses than heretofore.  The system has worked to date because of the vocational education committee involvement in developing their own institutions. To a large extent the institute will be rubber stamping a <i>de facto</i> situation but at the same time the Department of Education are being given the powers that really matter and these relate to the programmes and budgets of the colleges.</P>

    <P>I was alarmed when some Members suggested that the passage of these Bills should be delayed until after the publication of the Green Paper.  Indeed, the Green Paper is only a discussion the emphasis may be changed and may be reflected in the White Paper to be published. Are Members suggesting that the passage of these Bills should be delayed until the publication of the Education Act?  It would be frightening to consider the length of time it would take us to reach that stage, considering the numerous <Col N="931" /> steps we have had to take to the approach of the publication of the Green Paper.  We already have had the introductory process and I do not know if that will lead to a preface and whether there will be yet another stage before the Green Paper is published.  I think it would serve to halt the development of education if we were to propose that we should make no further movement on these Bills, which I consider can stand alone, until such time as the Green Paper is published.  This would be a total disservice to third level education, to the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges and furthermore to the students who hope to go to these colleges.  I would be strenuously opposed to such an approach and indeed would strongly urge the Minister to publish the Green Paper if that were to be the approach.</P>

      <P>I am totally opposed to any proposal to delay the passage of these Bills until the publication of the Green Paper.  We have had experience before that, if we wait too long, nothing will happen.  I hope we will proceed and enact these Bills.</P>

      <P>I wish to respond to the points Deputies made and it is important that I do so quickly.  Deputy Jim Higgins asked if the introduction of degree and postgraduate degree courses would coincide.  It is my wish that this would happen, assuming that is the decision within the timescale.  I see no reason this should happen in any other way.  I am keen to meet the Deputy's wishes in this regard as soon as we can do so.  The Deputy also said that competition is a good thing.  Of all people in this House, I can handle that concept but if two institutions ten miles apart are competing for a particularly expensive research project, which is undertaken at the taxpayers' expense, naked competition may not be the correct way to handle it.  A more streamlined form of competition may be the best way to deal with it because of the amount of public funds involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla referred to the role of the vocational education committee on the board of the new colleges.  May I remind the Deputy that 11 of the total of 18 members of the governing body of the Institute will be vocational education committee nominees, six of whom will be nominated directly by the vocational education committee, the other five coming from organisations which the vocational education committee will select.  In other words, 11 members will come directly or indirectly from the vocational education committee sector. Therefore, it is not fair to assume that in giving the governing body power we are pushing the vocational education committees aside because in this particular case the vocational education committee will have the major role on the Governing Body of the Dublin Institute of Technology. The other members will be nominated by the staff, the students, the Irish <Col N="933" /> Congress of Trade Unions and so on.  I accept the Deputy's point that the vocational education committees have played a major role in these colleges but still think they will play that role.  They can also ensure that their role is developed because of the very strong hand they will have on the Governing Body of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Members have emphasised the role of the elected representatives.  While I have stripped considerably the role the Minister will play, it must be remembered that Ministers are also elected representatives and that we are talking of national institutions funded largely from the national purse.  To that extent there is some legitimate overseeing role for the Minister of the day, without his meddling.  There is a very strong local requirement but not exclusively at the expense of the national role these institutions have to play.  I am not suggesting that Bolton Street would start offshore companies or that sort of thing but with all the action of last year they might get excited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to make a case on behalf of the pupils, teachers and parents at Ballyclough. Unlike a number of other national schools in my constituency whose problems arise mainly from the age of the school, Ballyclough national school is a relatively new building, having been constructed in 1981.  The demands on space in the school were seriously underestimated and the result is that 35 small children are being accommodated in a small partitioned area in grossly overcrowded conditions.  This is unfair to both the teachers and the children.  Parents and teachers have been concerned about the position for some time and have been <Col N="934" /> pressing for action to relieve it.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, advised the committee to proceed with the planning of an extension.  Plans, specifications and bills of quantities were prepared and the total cost was estimated at £33,000, of which the local community were to raise £7,000. The community set about raising the money and have reached their target. The Department of Education advised the board of management to invite tenders for the extension.  A number of tenders were received and one was accepted by the Department.  However, instead of giving the board the normal sanction to sign the contract, somebody in the Department of Education decided that the project should not go ahead and the whole process has ground to a halt.</P>
      <P>Parents in Ballyclough are mystified as to why the sudden decision was made to call a halt to the project when so much preparatory work had been done.  They want to know who in the Department of Education made that decision and why. They are angry that the small children of Ballyclough will have to continue to endure grossly overcrowded and unsuitable conditions.  Overcrowded conditions make the task of teachers and pupils much more difficult.  Poor conditions can often, despite the best efforts of teachers, inhibit the educational development of children.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to reverse the decision to block the project and allow it to go ahead without further delay.  The local community have played their part by raising their share of the money.  The Department should now do their job. The amount of money involved is tiny when compared with a total budget for primary education of £540 million in 1992.  I appeal to the Minister to give sanction and to allow the board of management to sign the contract for the extension.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given <Col N="935" /> me the opportunity of outlining my Department's intention in relation to the proposed extension to Ballyclough national school, County Cork.</P>
      <P>The present accommodation at this school consists of four classrooms and a general purposes room, which was completed in 1986.  I agree that conditions are less than satisfactory, from the point of view of accommodation, in view of the fact that the staffing now consists of a principal and five assistant teachers.  It was in response to this situation that in July 1991 my Department approved a grant towards the cost of a prefabricated classroom.  However, the school authorities subsequently said they wished to use the available grant-aid for this classroom to part grant-aid the erection of a permanent classroom extension, and my Department readily agreed to this.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the school authorities met the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who agreed to grant-aid the full cost of the permanent classroom at the standard rate and the Department's architectural staff prepared plans for the proposed extension.</P>
      <P>Local authority planning permission was granted in October 1991, and in 1991 my Department approved the invitation of tenders for the project.  These were invited and received in January 1992.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the whole process of architectural planning, securing of planning permissions, invitation of tenders and their examination is necessarily time consuming.  There is also the important factor that there is a large number of primary schools projects on hands, and each individual school makes the case to my Department that their situation is worthy of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that tenders have now been examined and the question of the placing of a contract arises for consideration in the context of the available capital resources.  It was not possible to include the project in the <Col N="936" /> expenditure programme which has been approved for 1992 because of other commitments and demands, but I can assure the Deputy that the position will be kept under review during the course of the year in the light of experience with ongoing commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter, which is of considerable concern to the parents and families of some 26 children, in an area extending from Annascaul to Slea Head and Dingle, who have been assessed as having special needs in education. These children range from five to 17 years and generally their condition is described as mildly or moderately mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>Currently, one child travels to a special school in Listowel each day, a distance well in excess of 40 miles.  Some others travel to special schools in Tralee, a distance of approximately 26 miles.  The parents urgently desire that their children should go to school in their own area and develop friendship in their community. People often find it difficult to understand the tremendous atmosphere of care and loving that exists between parents and families where there is a handicapped child and the close affinity that exists between all such parents and families. This is a factor that gives rise to the tremendous frustration of parents in the Dingle area in regard to the delay in having a resource teacher appointed. Because of this delay, children have to travel for the special education they need, being absent from home for very long periods each day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly appeal to the Minister and the Department of Education to provide a resource teacher for this area without further delay.  This teacher could be based in Dingle town or employed on a sessional basis in the school concerned. The subsequent saving to the Department <Col N="937" /> of Education in transport costs for these children over the years would offset, at least to some extent, the salary of a resource teacher for the area.  Therefore, there can be no longer any justifiable reason for a further delay in the appointment of this teacher.  It would allay the concern of parents in the area. I appeal to the Minister to deal urgently with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of the resource teacher was introduced recently in the context of the allocation of additional teaching posts which became available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The objective in creating these new posts was to provide additional back-up teacher support to schools which are coping with handicapped children in an integrated setting. The role of the resource teacher is to act in support of the ordinary class teachers by providing special support to those children in the school who have special needs.</P>
      <P>The extra teaching resources provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> allowed for the appointment of six such resource teachers.  The decisions regarding the selection of areas to receive these posts were based on a thorough review of need which was conducted on a national basis by the Department's inspectorate.  This review had full regard to the competing claims of many areas and in all cases account was taken of the number of handicapped children being taught in ordinary classes in an area.  The focus was on geographical areas of need rather that individual schools so that maximum benefit could be achieved in the use of this new resource.  The objective was that, while a resource teacher would be attached to one school, he or she could serve the wider needs of schools in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that as part of the inspectorate's review, full consideration was given to the needs of the Dingle area.  However, arising from their <Col N="938" /> detailed investigation, the Department's inspectorate concluded that greater areas of need existed in other locations and that, bearing in mind the limited number of posts available, priority should be given to these areas of greater need.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the Dingle area are not being lost sight of and that the case made will be borne in mind should the possibility of appointing further resource teachers arise in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It has come to my notice that something very odd is going on in Teagasc.  It seems that the current director is to retire at some stage in the next five years.  I have been informed it may not necessarily be this year or next year. Apparently, earlier this year, during February or early March, the board of Teagasc made a very curious decision and appointed a director-designate who, apparently, is to become the director when the current director retires.  I am not raising any question, Sir, about the director-designate &mdash; my purpose is totally different &mdash; I want to have a look at the procedures.  I should like to ask the Minister whether that appointment has been made in a manner which conforms to the provisions of section 7 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988.  In particular, I would like to know whether the Minister believes it conforms to the provisions of section 7 (5) which reads:</P>
      <P>The first Director shall be appointed, and may be removed from office at any time, by the Minister; each subsequent Director shall be appointed, and may be removed from office at any time, by Teagasc with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather there is no question of removing the present director.  I would like to know whether the Minister was consulted by the board of Teagasc when they proposed <Col N="939" /> this curious appointment for which no provision, that I can see, is made in the Act, to take up a position at some time within the next five years.  I would like to know if the Minister was even more intimately involved than is suggested in the consultation provided for in the Act? For example, did the Minister express a view that this person should be appointed in this manner to a post that does not yet exist?  Did the Minister exercise any suasion, moral or otherwise, on the board to make this very curious appointment? Did the Minister consider whether it would not be right and proper and in conformity with the principles of natural justice that if a vacancy was foreseen it should be advertised?  Would the Minister consider whether people who are already employed in Teagasc &mdash; and there are many excellently qualified people there &mdash; might not be given a chance of being considered on the basis of a competitive interview?  Would the Minister consider whether people from outside Teagasc might be in line for consideration for this appointment?  There are a great many people outside of Teagasc, apart from the current director-designate, who might be considered for this post.</P>
    <P>In short, was any consideration given to the normal procedure of a competitive series of interviews for this job rather than, as seems to have been the case in this instance, the designation of a person for a job which is not yet available?  Why was the appointment made in this curious way, long in advance of the vacancy? Why was an appointment made to a position for which there appears to be no provision in the Act?  I raised these questions in the debate on 12 June on the Agriculture Estimate and the Minister of State on that day chose, for whatever reason, not to give any answer.  I am sorry the Minister is not here tonight.  I can imagine that for reasons connected with events earlier today he may be feeling a <Col N="940" /> bit sheepish and may not be inclined to come out into the open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Dukes for raising this question.  The Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988 provided for the dissolution of An Foras Táluntais (AFT) and An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta (ACOT) and the establishment of Teagasc.  The then director of AFT was appointed as director of Teagasc and the director of ACOT was seconded to ERAD for a period of four years.</P>
      <P>The situation is that under section 7 (5) of this Act, the Minister for Agriculture and Food appoints the first director of Teagasc but each subsequent director is to be appointed by Teagasc subject to the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with this procedure the chairman of the board of Teagasc wrote to me on 4 March 1992 seeking my consent to the appointment of a person as director of Teagasc on the retirement of the current director.  On 12 March I gave my consent to this future appointment. The contractual terms and conditions pertaining to the appointment will be considered by myself and the Minister for Finance at a future date.  I can assure the House that the various procedures <Col N="941" /> laid down in the 1988 Act will be complied with.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that my function in relation to the appointment of a person as director is to convey my consent or otherwise to a proposal from the board of Teagasc to appoint a director.  I have no function in relation to how or when the board select the person they propose to appoint as director.</P>
    <P>I must also point out to the House that at this stage all that has happened is that the person concerned has returned to the body from which he was seconded when he was appointed director of ERAD.</P>

This matter has been going on for some considerable time and the amount of grants outstanding to the local group are considerable.  In spite of a parliamentary reply which I received some time ago, stating that all grants have been paid to this group, this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister of State that there is some confusion in the Department about the title or otherwise of the group involved.  Certainly the contents of <Col N="942" /> a parliamentary reply to my question and the information I have received from the group clearly indicate that moneys are still outstanding to the group.

Group water scheme grants of £1,615 were allocated to the Clifden group, County Kilkenny, in November 1989 for remedial works to their existing scheme.  All grants were paid in November 1991.  However, the Deputy may be referring to an adjacent group water scheme, Rathcash No. 2, which serves seven households from a bored well source.</P>

      <P>The people who live in the village of Kilrickle, near Loughrea, County Galway, are frightened out of their wits every day of their lives because of the speed at which traffic passes &mdash; or should I say flashes &mdash; through their village.  Kilrickle is situated on the main Galway-Dublin road and villagers fear for their lives as hundreds of cars drive through their village as if it were the grid at Mondello Park.  There have been some fatal accidents, many injuries and several near misses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give permission to Galway County Council to place what are called rumble strips on the road leading into the village at both ends, which would have the effect of slowing down the traffic.  I understand that a ministerial direction is required by the county council before they are legally entitled to place rumble strips on the road.  I ask <Col N="943" /> the Minister to consider funding special warning signs similar to the new flashing signs that have proved so effective on the new Athlone by-pass.  The signs would warn drivers to reduce speed.  There are other new signs required and I understand that the county engineer in Galway has decided to put a better road surface through the village as well.</P>
    <P>There is great anxiety and frustration in the local community, so much so that their local hall was packed to capacity the other night by people who want action of some description.  They would be extremely thankful for any help the Minister might give them.</P>

      <P>The road through the village of Kilrickle is part of a national primary route, and, consequently, ramps or other physical barriers to high speed are ruled out. I understand that there is a 30 mile per hours speed limit through the village, and that is the lowest limit the law allows.  It is a matter for the Garda to enforce the speed limit through the village and I understand that there is a high level of Garda activity at this location, with 168 detections for speeding since the beginning of this year.  It is clear that the local authority are anxious to improve the safety situation as much as possible, I understand that they are considering the provision of &ldquo;hard shoulders,&rdquo; which should assist in improving safety.  In addition, I have recently approved a proposal by the local authority to provide large speed limit signs that will have more of an impact on drivers.</P>

      <P>In Monasteraden, County Sligo, they are great triers.  They seek constantly to maximise what nature has put there.  Nature could possibly have been a little kinder so far as land is concerned, but it has generously made up for that with the wonderful lake waters all around.  The people of Monasteraden are very active in pursuing development opportunities, particularly in tourist promotion based on the attractions of Lough Gara.  They have utilised FÁS and other schemes for the practical and visual enhancement of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now, however, one major problem curtailing future progress, the lack of a sewerage system.  Already that has held up several tourist related developments that I know of.  Last week I visited the area myself, along with local councillor, Gerry Murray.  Monasteraden, along with Curry and Cloonacool, are, I think, the only small villages in County Sligo without sewerage schemes.  Sadly, this year the Government have discontinued allocations under the small water and sewerage schemes.  Perhaps Monasteraden would not qualify, but I want to protest anyway on behalf of Sligo County Council and, I am sure, all other local authorities.  The scheme was a very useful funding scheme.  The estimated cost of a sewerage scheme for Monasteraden is about £125,000, which is not very expensive. A sewerage scheme would enhance the village; it would result in a flurry of tourist related developments; it would facilitate in the building, in a familiar environment, of dwellings for the elderly who might need them; it would protect the environment and would enable a community who have shown they have courage, enterprise and commitment to realise their full potential.  I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to make an announcement here in the Dáil that he will be funding the scheme <Col N="945" /> in respect of which proposals have been submitted to his Department.</P>

The council have now proposed a package sewerage plan to provide extended aeration treatment at an estimated cost of £168,000.  A preliminary report has recently been received in my Department for the scheme, and that is under examination. However, having regard to the level of commitment on the sanitary services programme generally and the number of high priority schemes competing for the capital available, I am not in a position to indicate when a decision can issue to the local authority.</P>

      <P>The Ballingarry &mdash; Upper Commons group water supply scheme in County Limerick was formed in the mid-sixties.  The grant approved on 21 October 1969 was £1,500.  The water for the scheme is supplied from the Kilcolman Reservoir.  The two-inch piping used can no longer cope with the supply requirements of the 48 participants in the scheme.  Now, depending on location, some of the members do not have any water supply at certain times of the year. It is essential that the piping be improved. Additional storage capacity is also required.  Limerick County Council sent a letter of approval for the scheme on 19 April 1990 and they are still awaiting departmental approval.  The scheme has been estimated at a cost of £68,482.  The group water scheme grants have been estimated at £27,600 and the members of the scheme have collected £20,000.  What is still not known is the amount of special contribution and the balance that has to be met by the members of the group. It is now critically important that the Department of the Environment sanction this scheme to enable the work to commence as soon as possible in order to end the long wait of the frustrated members <Col N="946" /> of this scheme for an adequate supply of water.  I sincerely hope the Minister will clear this uncertainty and I look forward to an appropriate response.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>The group water scheme referred to was constructed more than 20 years ago to serve approximately 24 households and associated farms.  Since then more than 20 additional houses have been connected to the scheme.  The daily peak water requirement now exceeds the designated capacity and as a result some households, particularly those in elevated areas, have an unsatisfactory water supply during times of peak draw off. The group have submitted proposals to improve the supply by installing new pumping equipment, rising main and reservoir. Their proposal was approved by Limerick County Council on the condition that the group water main and reservoir were upsized to cater for the future development needs of the area. The cost of the improvement work is estimated at £68,482, including £20,000 for the additional works required by the council.  Group water scheme grants are estimated at £27,600 and the group have applied for a special contribution of £20,000 to cover the cost of county council requirements.  This would leave a balance of £20,900 to be met by way of members' contributions, which would amount to approximately £450 per member.  There are many applications for group water scheme grants on hand at this time and these cannot all be approved at once.  However, I will ensure that the Ballingarry group application is considered further as soon as circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 34, 45, 54, 68 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>The report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies on rate support grant distribution was received in my Department on 11 May 1992 and published on 18 May 1992. The report has been sent to each local authority for their views and additional copies of the printed report are being sent to local authorities for distribution to elected representatives.  Copies of the report have also been placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of members.</P>
      <P>The IFA report is a complex, technical one and any substantive comment by me on its proposals would obviously be inappropriate at this early stage.  The report follows directly from the work of the Advisory Expert Committee on local government reform (the Barrington Committee) which arranged for a twophase study on the grant distribution process. A report on Phase 1 of the study was published last year as a supplement to the report of the Barrington Committee. The report now published sets out the results of Phase 2.</P>
      <P>The report outlines equalisation models, based on various assumptions, which make it possible to compare the effects of a range of possible indicators for the distribution of the Rate Support Grant by reference to needs and resources.  The report is based on the use of statistical techniques and their application to selected criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities will wish to consider the IFS methodology for assessing needs, and their findings generally, and I will await their views before reaching any conclusions on the report.  A number of grant distribution options have been examined in the study, and each of these suggests significant redistribution of the Rate Support Grant between authorities <Col N="624" />&mdash;some would stand to gain and others to lose.  The implications have to be carefully examined before deciding on the feasibility and desirability of adopting one or other of the options suggested by IFS, or any other option of this kind.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, figures for house completions in each year are published in my Department's bulletins of housing statistics which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Since 1989, the continuous eight-year downward trend in housing output that had seen completions fall from some 28,900 in 1981 to 15,700 in 1988 has been halted and reversed.  I expect completions this year to be in the region of 20,000.  There is no reason to <Col N="626" /> believe that the current level of output is, in the aggregate, inadequate.

      <P>The Drinking Water Regulations, 1988, established a standard drinking water monitoring regime which is adhered to by all sanitary authorities, and set out the action to be taken where the quality of water does not meet the prescribed standards.  Comprehensive guidance on implementation of the Regulations is available to sanitary authorities in a Handbook published by the Environmental Research unit.  This provides advice on a range of relevant issues, including design of sampling programmes, selection of parameters for monitoring, frequency of analysis, reporting arrangements and action programmes.</P>

      <P>The housing measures agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were further elaborated in &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo; published in February, <Col N="639" /> 1991.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992, which is currently before the House, makes statutory provision, as necessary, for the measures set out in the Plan.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific issue of homelessness, I draw attention to pages 15 and 16 of the Plan, which deal with relevant policy measures.  Since the Plan was published, revised guidelines have issued to housing authorities in regard to the accommodation needs of homeless persons and the authorities have been requested to utilise fully their powers to secure accommodation for any homeless persons in their areas and to give effect to the measures identified in the Plan.</P>
      <P>Details of the results of the assessment by housing authorities of the scale of homelessness in their areas at 31 March, 1991 were published in the Housing Statistics Bulletins for the September, 1991 Quarter and for the year 1991, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>Copies of the <i>Guidelines for State Bodies</i>, as approved by the Government, were forwarded to all bodies under the aegis of my Department in March last. Some of those bodies were already operating a system of declarations of interest. All bodies, including those to which I have very recently made appointments, will now conform to the guidelines which require a much wider disclosure of interest than is required under the Companies Acts.  This additional information is not made available for public inspection.</P>
      <P>The guildelines make it clear that State bodies which are plcs are subject to the Companies Acts in the normal way and also confirm that State companies established by statute only should voluntarily conform to the requirements of the Companies Acts until their legislation can be changed.</P>
      <P>Members of the board of An Bord Pleanála are statutorily required to make declarations containing particulars of specific interests in relation to land. These declarations are available for public inspection.</P>

The primary purpose of this Initiative is to produce an effective process for ongoing and integrated transportation planning in the Greater Dublin Area. This process will, in turn, provide a long term transportation strategy and a medium term investment/implementation programme.  The Phase 2 final report is due in April 1993, with an interim report in September 1992.</P>

      <P>To determine the level of emigration accurately in any period it would be necessary to have comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures relating to the movement of persons into and out of the State.  In the absence of such procedures the only reliable estimates are those for net migration (i.e. the difference between inward and outward flows) between successive Censuses of Population.</P>
      <P>In the 1986/1991 intercensal period it is estimated that outward migration exceeded inward migration by about 136,500 persons.  This figure is derived as a residual by subtracting the natural increase in the population (that is the number of births less the number of deaths from the change in population as measured by the 1986 and 1991 Census of Population.</P>

The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Mr. Noel Treacy, TD, represented Ireland.  This was the fourth meeting of this group of Ministers, the first having taken place in 1989.</P>
      <P>As regards regional policy, the Ministers reviewed the implementation since 1989 of the reform of the structural funds and considered issues related to the future operation of the structural funds and the new Cohesion Fund.  The discussion concentrated mainly on the methods of operation of the funds rather than on the budgetary aspects although these were touched on.  The Ministers took a generally favourable view of the implementation of the reform of the funds and had a useful exchange of views on how the operation of the funds can be streamlined and made more efficient in the future.  As this was an informal meeting, no formal decisions were taken.</P>
      <P>The Ministers also discussed territorial planning issues, with particular reference to trans European networks.</P>

      <P>The management of the State personal savings schemes, including the determination of the interest rate payable on Savings Certificates, is now the responsibility of the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms and conditions of Savings Certificates are reviewed continuously by the Agency by reference to other investment opportunities available in the marketplace. There is no evidence that Savings Certificates are uncompetitive. <Col N="659" /> Net receipts in the current year, up to 12 June, amount to almost £85 million.  This compares to £40 million for the same period last year.</P>
    <P>Competition is likely to increase as a result of the introduction of the 10 per cent rate of DIRT on special savings accounts by 31 December 1992.  Savings Certificates will, however, remain the only Irish investment media which can offer tax-free fixed rates of interest for a period of five years with a State guarantee. Rates of interest on the new special savings accounts, as well as being subject to the 10 per cent tax, may be fixed for a maximum of two years.</P>

    <P>The 1991 amnesty, relating to Capital Acquisitions Tax and Estate Duty, produced £13 million.  It applied to those taxpayers who brought their affairs up to date by 30 September 1991.</P>
    <P>An amnesty is at present available in respect of Stamp Duty liabilities.  It applies to documents executed before 1 November, 1991.  All interest and penalties for the late payment of duty on these documents will be waived if the duty is paid by 30 June, 1992.  From 1 July to 30 September, 1992, interest and penalties will be partially waived.</P>
    <P>To date, about £3.5 million has been paid in approximately 2,800 cases.  The estimated yield for the amnesty is £10 million and the Revenue Commissioners expect to meet that estimate by the end of September, when the amnesty will end.</P>
    <P>Tax amnesties are not generally desirable. They involve substantial concessions to taxpayers who may be significantly in arrears with the payment of tax or to taxpayers who have evaded some or all of the tax that they owe.  This is most unfair to compliant taxpayers.  In addition, the grant of one amnesty may lead to an expectation that another may be introduced at some stage in the future and so may damage compliance.</P>
    <P>The three amnesties that have been introduced were, therefore, conceded most reluctantly and only because major reforms were being introduced in the law and the administration of the taxes in question &mdash; reforms, in the case of the 1988 amnesty, such as the power of attachment and increased auditing, which have ensured that non-complying taxpayers have faced a more hostile cli- <Col N="661" /> mate than has been the case prior to their introduction.  It was the Government's view that these reforms could not be implemented successfully:</P>
    <P>&mdash;if the Revenue Commissioners had to run for some considerable time into the future, the new system of Self-Assessment side by side with an old system requiring continued detailed examination and assessment of all relevant outstanding cases; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;if taxpayers affected by the new system were not given the opportunity to &ldquo;come clean&rdquo; at its inception.</P>
    <P>In these very particular circumstances, the 1988 amnesty was necessary to ensure the success of the reforms that were being introduced; otherwise, they would not have been put in place.  Similar considerations applied in the other cases also.</P>

      <P>Where motor vehicles, including cars, have been scrapped or destroyed, a refund of vehicles excise duty (road tax) may be made under the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations, 1982 (as amended).</P>
      <P>An application for a refund of duty must be made not less than three months prior to the expiry of the vehicle licence (tax disc), and a refund is not made where the annual rate of duty paid on the licence does not exceed thirty pounds.</P>
      <P>As there is no provision for the &ldquo;swapping&rdquo; of a vehicle licence between vehicles following the scrapping/ destruction of a vehicle, the absence of a refund system could result in a motorist paying vehicle excise duty twice during the same period.</P>

      <P>Capital flows both into and out of the Irish currency are a continuous feature of the financial markets.  In net terms, however, the available information does not point to substantial outflows of funds in the first quarter of the year.  Autonomous capital flows appear to have been in broad balance during the first three months of 1992 and the official external reserves increased by £240 million.</P>
      <P>If outflows were considered excessive the Central Bank would take the necessary steps to protect the value of the Irish currency, including, for example, intervention on the foreign exchange market, and/or the adjustment of liquidity conditions in the money market.</P>
      <P>Over the long term, the best protection against outflows of funds from the domestic economy is the maintenance of a stable economic environment, including a firm and stable exchange rate, and responsible fiscal policies, and the Government will continue to provide this environment.</P>

      <P>No formal offer to this effect has been made.  The land in question comprises approximately 876 acres and was acquired by Coillte Teoranta for commercial afforestation. I understand that the company are, however, willing to dispose of the property to Killarney Golf Club should agreement be reached in relation to the lease by the Office of Public Works of the area on the periphery of Killarney National Park which is required, along with other lands in private ownership, in connection with the proposed third golf course.  Coillte will not carry out any <Col N="676" /> planting on site before a decision is taken on the golf course issue.</P>
      <P>The land is located in Foardal town-land and is similar in nature to adjoining lands within the National Park.  It would be a significant addition to the park, ensuring that the area remained available for grazing by red deer and that it retained its high landscape-scenic qualities. This would not be the case if the area was planted commercially for timber production. The property, therefore, has a significant commercial value in this regard.</P>
      <P>I might add that no final decision on the granting of a lease to the golf club will be made until details of the proposed layout of the course are made available to the Office of Public Works, and the potential impacts of same are examined.</P>
      <P>Any bona fide offers from voluntary organisations to purchase land for Killarney National Park, or indeed any national park will be welcomed by me.</P>

      <P>An extensive archaelogical investigation lasting 15 weeks was completed in January, 1990 on the site purchased for a new Garda station in Drogheda.  The total cost of the excavation works, research, and post excavation work was £45,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of this survey necessitated a revision of the design of the station in order to preserve certain archaeological features.  The cost of this revised scheme gave rise to concern, however, and a further review of the scheme was required.  This is nearing completion following <Col N="677" /> recent consultations with the Department of Justice and the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Phoenix Park Management Plan of 1986 set out the policy for management of the deer herd.  It stated:</P>
      <P>The deer will be managed to ensure that a healthy herd is kept at the present population level of approximately 300.  This will entail culling of poor and sickly animals, continuous monitoring of deer health and protection of deer from traffic.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of this objective the Office of Public Works engaged, together with the Zoology Department of UCD, in a scientific study of the deer in the following years.  By 1990 the size of the herd had grown to 525 and it was clear that culling needed to be undertaken immediately if the growth in numbers was to be kept in check.  In the first instance it was decided to remove deer which reacted positive to a TB test.  Following a round-up of most of the herd in January, 1991, 23 deer tested positive and were removed by professional staff.  Thirteen other deer were put down during the capture operation. In March 1992, a further round-up was undertaken when 39 reactors were removed and a further 18 were put down.</P>

It is a specific condition of grant-aid that projects are compatible with the protection of the environment.  Furthermore, the planting of broadleaves is encouraged by providing the highest grants of £2,000 a hectare for these species only.  In addition, the recently introduced Planned Recreational Forestry Scheme encourages the development of mainly broadleaf forests with public recreational facilities.  This scheme particularly encourages participation by local authorities and the involvement of local communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, there are a number of differing views as to the cause of the sea trout problem.  While the Report of the Sea Trout Action Group pointed to the increase in the number of sea lice emanating from salmon farms as the major contributory factor, the Sea Trout Scientific Working Group concluded, on the basis of the evidence to date, that it has not been possible to demonstrate a causitive link between production of lice from salmon farms and subsequent infestation of sea trout in specific bays.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major action plan to combat the problem of declines of sea trout in the West of Ireland.  This programme pinpoints three areas for action:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Research into the causes of sea trout declines is to be intensified.  I have appointed my Chief Scientific Advisor to direct and co-ordinate all research projects into this complex problem.  There is to be additional emphasis on the life cycle of the sea louse and sea trout physiology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;New management strategies for fish farms.  These strategies will include <Col N="681" /> increased use of the following principle for cage sites: lower stocking densities; and a unified bay by bay approach to husbandry and sea lice treatments.</P>
    <P>&mdash; I have met with representatives of the salmon farmers and secured their full support for this new management regime.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Conservation of existing stocks.  I have made new by-laws to protect sea trout by shortening the season for salmon drift-net fishing, introducing sanctuary areas for sea trout and prohibiting the catching of the fish.  My Department and the Western and North-Western Regional Fisheries Boards will work closely to ensure that the protection measures are enforced rigorously.</P>
    <P>Work on this complex problem must go forward in a spirit of co-operation, and differing perceptions as to the cause of the problem must not stand in the way of the concerted action.  My objective is to ensure the wellbeing of the wildfishery and angling tourism which is worth £74 million a year, as well as of the salmon farming industry, which employs some 1,100 workers in coastal communities and is worth £30 million to local economies.</P>

The Board carries out annual engineering inspections and any necessary renewals and replacements are also carried out.</P>
      <P>The bridge is deemed to be safe for motorists and pedestrians provided the conditions outlined above are adhered to.  The Board also stated that any abuse of the load and speed restrictions will weaken the structure and shorten its life.</P>

      <P>The number of Parliamentary Questions tabled to the Minister for Justice in 1991 was 1,060.  It is not possible to give the total cost involved in answering the questions without carrying out detailed and costly research into the work that was involved in the preparation of the answer to each and every question.  It is the practice, when the information sought in a question is not readily available from records and would have to be specially compiled at inordinate cost, to answer the question to that effect.</P>

      <P>The number of parliamentary questions tabled to my Department in 1991 was in the region of 1,050.  Unfortunately the time and expense necessary in terms of research and deployment of personnel to isolate the cost of a single reply is prohibitive and I am not in a position to let the Deputy have a definitive figure for the total costs involved.</P>
      <P>However, an extensive survey of Government Departments in 1982 estimated the cost of answering a Parliamentary Question at about £40.  When inflation is taken into account, I am advised that the cost today would be about £64.</P>

      <P>Grants towards the cost of furniture, a sink unit and a ballcourt at Scoil Mhuire, Portroe, County Tipperary were sanctioned by my Department in December 1991.  A payable order in respect of the grant for the furniture and sink unit, which were installed prior to the grant approval, has been issued to the school authorities.  Delivery of the payable order which was dated 15 May, 1992 was delayed by the postal dispute.</P>
      <P>Grants are issued following the normal procedures of inspection and the certification by our professional advisers that the grant-aided works have been carried out satisfactorily.  Payments are processed as speedily as possible taking into account the volume of cases being handled in the Department at any one time.</P>
      <P>Tender documents prepared by the Department's professional advisers were forwarded to the school authorities to enable them to invite tenders for the ballcourt.  In the event of the school proceeding with the work payment will be made as soon as possible following completion and satisfactory certification by the Department's professional advisers.</P>

      <P>In this connection, I have arranged for my officials to meet representatives from St. Joseph's at an early date.</P>
      <P>I should point out that my Department's ongoing commitment to the school in question is well illustrated by the fact that, since 1990, equipment for practical subjects, valued at approximately £32,000, has been installed in the school.  Also, following recent communications with my Department, audiological equipment costing £13,000 for two classrooms will be provided in the new school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, pending the outcome of the review referred to, my Department has allowed St. Joseph's to maintain its staff at a level well in excess of that warranted by the official pupil teacher ratios.</P>
      <P>As already indicated to the Deputy, the issues raised are of a most complex nature.  They are taking longer than anticipated to resolve and to date I have had no progress of substance to report.

      <Col N="716" /> The in-service training programme is aimed at developing teachers' knowledge of course content, enhancing their skills in teaching methodologies and in keeping them abreast of developments in education.</P>
    <P>The major thrust of in-service training at second-level will be the further development of the training programme for the Junior Certificate.  In addition, at both primary and post primary levels, specialist training in specific aspects of the curriculum will be carried out through a series of summer courses in these areas. These courses will include training in gender equity issues, new technologies and home-school links in addition to training in the teaching of specific subjects.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a sum of £265,000 is being provided for the specific purposes of the development of teachers' skills in the area of pupil assessment, in dealing with disadvantaged pupils and in the area of organisation and management of schools.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was granted a Road Passenger Certificate in December, 1977 confirming that he satisfied the EC requirements pertaining at that time of good repute, appropriate financial standing and professional competence.  These are the requirements necessary to enter the occupation of road passenger operator.</P>
      <P>In 1989 the EC drew up a new Directive which revised the standards necessary to meet the good repute, financial standing and professional competence requirements.  The relevant implementing regulations are in force here since 21 March, 1991, but existing operators have until 30 June 1992 to meet the revised standards, the deadline having twice been extended to facilitate the industry.  Road passenger certificates have now been replaced by road passenger transport operators' licences.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy has satisfied the professional competence requirement and has now to meet the good repute and appropriate financial standing requirements.</P>
      <P>He lodged an application for the appropriate licence in May 1991 but as it was incomplete it was returned to him. To date it has not been returned to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Governments have decided that it would neither be practical nor in the national interest to license illegal rebroadcasting or rebeaming systems. <Col N="720" /> The reasons have been given in a number of replies to questions in this House.  In particular, I refer the Deputy to Questions No. 65 on 18 May 1988, columns 1791-92, volume 380, Official Report No. 8 for that day, Question No. 87 on 20 November 1990, columns 1802-3, volume 402, Official Report for that day and Question No. 2 on 2 April 1992, columns 417-419, Volume 418 of the Official Report for that day.</P>
      <P>While I have no wish to deprive anybody of a choice of television viewing the illegal systems will have to close down as alternative legal services (cable or MMDS) become available.  On the question of cost, charges for MMDS will have to reflect the considerable investment involved in establishing MMDS systems and the ongoing operating costs such as licence fees and copyright charges associated with providing a high quality service on a national basis in a business-like way. Inevitably, these costs will be higher than those associated with many of the deflector systems, which because of their illegal nature, do not attract such costs. However, as with cable, there are &ldquo;easy payment&rdquo; schemes available to MMDS subscribers.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that the services provided are adequate to deal with demand at present but I do also recognise the valuable contribution of voluntary bodies in this sensitive area.  In particular, I would mention the Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country which support and counsel victims of rape and sexual abuse.  State funding of £152,000 for the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and £25,000 for each of the five Rape Crisis Centres located in Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Clonmel has been allocated for 1992 to ensure that the valuable work being carried out by the centres is continued.</P>

Primary care and management of persons infected with the virus and education and prevention strategies, have been identified by the committee in reports which I have had published recently.  These include home and family support services.  These reports are now being implemented and investment in this process is ongoing as the Government have made available substantial additional resources for AIDS/HIV services this year.  It is in that context and having regard to the need to have an integrated and effectively managed service that any application for funds for HIV/AIDS services will be considered. Given the co-ordinating role of the health boards in the delivery of services at regional level an application for financial support by the AIDS Care Education and Training Organisation should in the first instance be addressed to the relevant health board.  I have in fact conveyed this directly to the organisation.</P>

      <P>While I have no plans for a national women's health week in 1992 my Department's Health Promotion Unit is currently involved in a number of significant initiatives at national level of particular relevance to women's health.</P>
      <P>The situation regarding diagnostic mammography and cervical screening services was outlined in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 92 on 4 March 1992.  Since that date I have reconvened the working group on cervical screening who will consider what further improvements can be made in the area of cervical screening.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department works closely with the Council for the Status of Women on issues relevant to women's health.  The unit recently made a grant available for the organisation by the council of a seminar on young women and smoking and for the publication of a report on the seminar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unit also conducted a week-long training course for youth officers of the Irish Countrywomen's Association, from every county in Ireland, on the topic of drug prevention strategies at local level. <Col N="728" /> The Health Promotion Unit supplied a wide range of resource materials to the ICA for this.  Following the course ICA officers carried out health education activities in their own locality.  The unit intends to hold a follow-up session this autumn.</P>
    <P>Another joint initiative which the unit is developing, on a pilot basis, with the Irish Countrywomen's Association is a healthy lifestyles programme entitled &ldquo;Lifewise&rdquo;.  This programme deals with exercise, relaxation and other health topics such as nutrition, smoking and alcohol use.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Community Health Nursing is closely involved with women's groups in the community.  The Health Promotion Unit held a national two-day training course for members of the institute on 15 and 16 June 1992 in communication and group work skills.  The Health Promotion Unit also ran two training courses for members of the institute on similar themes last year.</P>
    <P>In our present AIDS Awareness Convenience Advertising Campaign specific messages are targeted at women through women's clinics by the placement of AIDS awareness messages in these venues.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit is also making a grant of £5,000 to the Global Forum on Women held in July 1992 under the auspices of the Centre for Women's studies in Trinity College, Dublin.  A special theme of the forum is &ldquo;Valuing Women's Health: Safety and Choices&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A range of information materials on current women's health issues is available from the Health Promotion Unit of my Department and from regional health boards.

      <P>The Government have initiated a drugs strategy aimed at rationalising the use of prescription medication in the State.</P>
      <P>As part of this strategy, the Govenment established the National Therapeutics Advisory Committee which is charged with examining all aspects of current prescribing.  The committee will, in the context of its overall work programme, be examining the area of addiction to prescribed medicines and making recommendations as to how this matter can best be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The drugs strategy was devised in accordance with the recommendations of the review group on the GMS which reported in 1991.  The strategy is aimed not alone at creating a consciousness of the cost consequences of prescribing but also at encouraging both prescribers and the public alike to question the need for prescription medication.  One of the recommendations of that group was that a programme of public education be undertaken with a view to re-shaping public attitudes to prescribing and promoting more self-sufficiency in the management of common self limiting medical problems.</P>
      <P>As an initial step in this regard, a poster has been devised, in consultation with the ICGP and the IMO, for display in all areas where prescriptions are issued. These posters have been distributed to all general practitioners and are currently being issued to all health boards and hospitals.  It is planned that further initiatives will be taken in this area throughout the course of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards persons who have problems of addiction to controlled drugs, in line with the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse, published in May 1991, there is a range of treatment programmes available from various locations, including the regional health boards; the Drug Treatment Centre, Trinity Court, Dublin 2; the EHB Outreach Project, Coolmine Therapeutic Community; Anna Liffey <Col N="730" /> Drug Project; Ballymun Action Project; Merchant's Quay Project; Arbour House and the St. Francis Training Centre, Cork, and individual general practitioner services.</P>

      <P>An after-hours social worker service for the young homeless was established by the Eastern Health Board on 19 March last on a trial basis.  The service was introduced in response to a need identified in discussions which my colleague Deputy Chris Flood, Minister of State had with the health board and representatives of the various voluntary agencies working with the young homeless in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The service has been warmly welcomed by the Garda and by the various statutory and voluntary agencies who have come in contact with it.  While there have been some teething problems, the health board and the other relevant agencies are satisfied that the service is a positive new development which is proving effective in assisting homeless youngsters.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of all aspects of the operation of the service to date.  As part of this process, the main statutory and voluntary agencies concerned are being invited to make submissions to the health board on the service.  The need for improvements and modifications to the service will be considered in the context of this review.</P>

      <P>The management of St. Ita's Hospital is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  The board now provides a separate mental handicap service, called St. Joseph's, for people with mental handicap on the campus of St. Ita's Hospital. Nurses with a mental handicap qualification have been recruited to this service and a post graduate course in mental handicap nursing is being run by the Eastern Health Board under the auspices of An Bord Altranais, for psychiatric nurses who wish to develop their expertise in mental handicap.  A comprehensive range of other in-service courses is also being provided for the staff in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is of the view that the large institutional buildings on the campus of St. Ita's Hospital are unsuitable to accommodate people with a mental handicap.  In 1991 two of the former staff houses on the campus were converted into hostels for clients of the service which facilitated the closure of one of the main institutional units.  This year the Eastern Health Board intends to open a further 23 places in three other group homes on the campus.  This will facilitate the closure of a further institutional unit.  The board plans to continue this process of transfer from the institutional accommodation.  Before any client is transferred, his or her individual needs are assessed, and an individual programme plan agreed.  Parents are actively involved in the transfer and the preparation of programme plans.  The board has embarked on the provision of a comprehensive range of community services in north County Dublin with the initial <Col N="742" /> aim of preventing inappropriate new admissions of people with mental handicap to St. Ita's Hospital.</P>

      <P>The gross Health Estimate for 1991, as published in the Revised Estimates for Public Services for 1991 was £1,542.696 million.  The corresponding outturn figure, as published in the 1992 Revised Estimates is £1,656.244 million.  The increase of the outturn over the original Estimates amounts to £113.548 million.  The The increase is principally accounted for by a Supplementary Estimate which was debated in this House on 13 December 1991 and issues from Vote 44&mdash;Increases in Remuneration and Pensions &mdash; as detailed at page 217 of Revised Estimates for Public Services, 1992.  A detailed breakdown of the progression from the original gross Estimate to the gross outturn for 1991 is given in the following tabular statement.</P>

      <P>Provisional Garda returns show that, in the period January to April 1992, 143 people were killed in road accidents on Irish roads compared with 116 in 1991, 153 in 1990, 147 in 1989, 129 in 1988, and 126 in 1987.</P>
      <P>The report "Road Accident Facts", which is prepared and published by the Environmental Research Unit sets out definitive road accident statistics on an annual basis.  These publications, which are based on reports submitted by the Garda Síochána, provide detailed analysis and commentary on the causes of road accidents generally.  The report for 1991 will be published in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major road safety campaign, originally launched in September 1990, is being implemented on my behalf by the National Safety Council.  Drink driving and excessive speeding are recognised as significant factors in road accident <Col N="745" /> fatalities and injuries and the main focus of the road safety campaign is, therefore, to achieve better public awareness of the dangers in these areas.</P>
    <P>The road safety campaign includes an advertising-promotion campaign and more enforcement action by the Garda, particularly in relation to speed and drink driving.</P>
    <P>Measures are also being included in a new Road Traffic Bill to make the roads safer.  The main target of the Bill will be drink driving but I intend that the Bill will also include other enforcement provisions, such as a requirement to carry driving licences at all times when driving, impoundment of vehicles, and increased disqualification periods for certain offences.</P>

      <P>Traffic controls are implemented under a wide range of regulations, by-laws and temporary rules made under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 1987.  The measures include the making of general traffic regulations by the Minister for the Environment and the making of local traffic and parking by-laws or temporary rules by the Garda Commissioner.  The specific application of traffic and parking management measures is achieved through the utilisation of regulatory traffic signs, provided by local authorities <Col N="746" /> either at the request of or with the consent of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Section 62 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968 provides that the Minister for the Environment may, by order, transfer specified functions of the Garda Commissioner in relation to road traffic and parking controls to a road authority and I am at present considering the extent to which devolution of this kind could be effected.</P>
      <P>The built up area speed limit of 30 mph applies to roads in urban areas except those to which an alternative speed limit is applied by regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 and 1968.  Devolution of powers to local authorities in relation to the application of special speed limits on non-national roads is being considered in the context of the Road Traffic Bill which is currently being drafted.</P>
      <P>Local authorities may provide road ramps for restricting the speed of vehicles, and bollards for preventing or restricting the use of a public road by mechanically propelled or animal drawn vehicles.  The regulations which set out the procedures applying to the provision of ramps and bollards and which lay down specifications and design features are at present under review and local authorities have been invited to furnish their views on these aspects.  In addition, certain local authorities have been asked to carry out experiments with rumble strips so as to assess their effectiveness.</P>

Article 20 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Licensing) Regulations, 1978 provides that public service vehicles may be inspected at any time and as often as the commissioner thinks fit.  In the case of large public service vehicles, (i.e. those with more than eight passenger seats) an inspection must be undertaken at least once in every year and small public service vehicles (taxis and private hire vehicles) must be inspected before a licence may be granted or renewed (i.e. generally on an annual basis).</P>

My function in relation to the bureau is limited to being a party to the agreement with the company (the most recent made in December 1988) which defines the criteria under which they will compensate innocent victims of road accidents caused by uninsured and &ldquo;hit and run&rdquo; drivers of motor vehicles.  I have no function in relation to the management, financing and operation of the bureau.</P>

The meeting was one of reflection on the future of the Community.  Commission members also visited the EC and member states' stands at the Seville Expo.</P>
      <P>Among the subjects discussed was the issue of the Community's co-operation with developing countries in the light of recent changes in the world.  The deliberations are at a preliminary stage.  A discussion document has been sent to the Council of Ministers.  This is being examined in the relevant working group and I expect that Ministers will have an opportunity to exchange views on it at the next Development Council, which will be held in November.</P>

      <P>The new Treaty on European Union, in Article J. 8 (2), states the rule that under the common foreign and security policy, the Council shall take decisions by unanimity.  There is provision for exceptions to this rule in the implementation of joint action under Article J. 3 (2).  However, as such exceptions must themselves be defined by unanimity, there remains a fundamental safeguard for individual member states against being outvoted on matters which they consider sensitive.</P>
      <P>The Declaration on voting under the CFSP to which the question refers states that to the extent possible, member states will avoid preventing a unanimous decision where a qualified majority exists in favour of that decision.  This is a political commitment on the part of the Twelve to try to reach agreement.  It does not alter the rules on decision-making contained in the Treaty.</P>

Existing records on the 1972 referendum do not provide information on the breakdown of this expenditure between various publicity activities.</P>
      <P>The following documentation was produced in connection with the accession negotations and the 1972 referendum: 15,000 copies of the White Paper on Ireland's accession to the EC were printed and either sold by the Government Publications Sale Office or distributed free of charge by Government Departments; of 310,000 copies of &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo;, a summary of the White Paper, were distributed to the public through the postal service and by other means; 86,000 copies of the Irish version of &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo; were similarly distributed.</P>

    <P>Documentation available relating to the 1972 referendum does not indicate that public relations agencies were employed in connection with publicity. No special advertising arrangements, other than those applying to normal Government advertising, were made for the referendum.</P>
    <P>As regards the 1987 referendum, the Government published the following material (all of which was distributed free of charge): 20,000 copies of a detailed information booklet on the Single European Act; 50,000 copies of a brief guide which summarised the provisions of the Single Act in a succinct form; a series of eight explanatory leaflets which addressed various aspects of the Single Act.  A total of 6,620,000 copies of these leaflets were printed and distributed.</P>
    <P>The total cost of producing the foregoing material (excluding VAT) was £181,731.44, of which £175,231.44 was for the brief guide and the explanatory booklets and £6,500 was for the information booklet, including printing costs.</P>

      <P>A precise statement of the costs involved in responding to Parliamentary Questions is not available.  However, I would refer the Deputy to a reply given by the Minister for Finance to a Parliamentary Question on 13 February this year.  Basing his answer on a 1982 survey of Government Departments and updating the figure to allow for inflation, the Minister for Finance suggested an average cost of about £64 per question. If this figure were applied, the total cost for the Department of Foreign Affairs of replying to Parliamentary Questions in 1991 would be £38,080.</P>

In so far as the beef premium is concerned, the draft Regulation gives member states a choice of establishing either individual or regional ceilings based on a reference year.  As regards the suckler cow premium, it provides for individual ceilings only.  It also provides for the possibility of transferring premium rights acquired in respect of individual ceilings to other producers, under certain conditions, either together with the holding, or without retaining the link between premium rights and land farmed.  However, decisions on the administration of the premium schemes must await the outcome of next weeks Council of Ministers meeting.</P>

      <P>The Disadvantaged Areas Appeal Panel received over 1,500 appeal applications from groups of farmers in 15 counties in Leinster and Munster who were not included in the extension of the disadvantaged areas.  The area under appeal is estimated at 3 million acres comprising 40,000 individual farms and covering 10,000 townlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A 100 per cent survey of farms was carried out by the Department at the <Col N="766" /> behast of the panel early this year.  The task of processing the very large amount of data on computer is under away and is expected to be completed by the end of July.  At that stage the panel will commence its analysis of the results and make recommendations to me as to the areas to be included in a submission to the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>Because of the complexity of the task it is not easy to predict how long the analysis will take.  However, I would like to assure the Deputy that both the panel and the Department are anxious to complete the job as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition to extension appeals, the panel invited applications from farming groups who were not included in the recent reclassification.  Almost 700 applications have been received comprising over 2 million acres in 19 counties.  The panel is currently considering the most suitable method of processing these applications.</P>

      <P>The thrust of Government policy in relation to social welfare benefits in recent years has been to maintain or increase the general level of benefits in real terms, while providing additional increases in the rates of the lowest payments. Budgetary increases in invalidity pension rates have been in line with the general increase in social welfare payments, which in 1990 amounted to 5 per cent, and in 1991 and 1992 to 4 per cent per annum.  These increases are in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to protect social welfare rates against inflation.</P>
      <P>On the introduction of invalidity pension in 1970, the basic rate of payment was set at the level applying to disability benefit.  Subsequently, in keeping with the policy of providing higher payments to long term recipients, invalidity pension rates were increased above those for disability benefit.  Invalidity pension payment levels will be reviewed in a budgetary context taking account of the relevant recommendations of the National Pensions Board and the commitments given under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>I am aware that officers of a special investigation unit in my Department carried out routine investigations of unemployment payments recipients in Ardfinnan in the week commencing 18 May 1992.</P>
      <P>Two officers attended at the Ardfinnan Community Hall on Tuesday morning, 19 May 1992, and accepted 177 unemployment payment dockets which would normally have been handed in at the local Garda station.  In accepting the dockets the officers briefly spoke to all those who attended to verify that each person presenting the docket was the person named on it and each one understood and complied with the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments. Where it was considered necessary to go into detail regarding the person's entitlement a written request was issued to the person to attend for interview at Ardfinnan Community Hall, at a specified date and time.</P>
      <P>Over two days, 20 and 21 May 1992, the two officers conducted 64 such interviews at the Community Hall.  The interviewing was carried out in two separate rooms to ensure privacy and confidentiality. These officers operate under a written code of conduct, one element of which specifically relates to client privacy.  The procedures followed are specifically designed with the dignity and privacy of the unemployed person in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of these officers is an integral part of the necessary control measures for all the payment schemes administered by my Department.  Entitlement to unemployment payments is subject to the conditions that a claimant must be unemployed, available for, capable of, and genuinely seeking employment.  My Department must be satisfied that claimants continue to meet these conditions while they are in receipt of payment.  For <Col N="777" /> this reason all claims are subject to review from time to time.</P>
    <P>No complaint has been received by my Department from the Ardfinnan Community Council or from any individual dealt with during these investigations.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the £10 temporary alleviating payment, which has since been reduced to £6, which was paid following the implementation of EC Directive 79/7 on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security.  This payment was made to men whose spouses no longer qualified as adult dependants by virtue of having income in excess of £50 per week from employment.</P>
      <P>Following on the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986, the then Government introduced the alleviating payments for a period of twelve months.  During 1987, the Government decided to continue these payments beyond the twelve month period and to phase out the payments over a period of time.  Phasing out began in 1988 with the payment being gradually reduced each year to its present level of £6.</P>
      <P>However, arising from recent decisions of the European Court of Justice, it has emerged that the alleviating payments are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment and cannot be continued.  These payments are being discontinued therefore with effect from the end of July 1992, coinciding with the date of implementation of this year's Budget increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> The precise information requested by the Deputy is not readily available but approximately 4,000 men are currently in receipt of the £6 payment at a cost of £1,300,000 in a full year.  Having regard to the minimum increase of £2.20 per week in the personal rates of payment from the end of July 1992, the maximum net reduction arising from the discontinuance of the £6 temporary alleviating payment is £3.80 per week.</P>
    <P>The overall measures now being implemented by the Government in the area of equal treatment give rise to a net cost of £20 million in the current year.</P>

      <P>A total of 4,172 parliamentary questions was received in my Department during 1991.  Of these, 3,363 (80 per cent) were withdrawn by the Deputies and 809 were answered.  The bulk of the 3,363 questions withdrawn related to problems that claimants were experiencing which could be resolved immediately or where the problem had already been resolved.  In these cases a letter confirming the position was issued to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In relation to cost it is not possible in the time available to give the total cost involved in dealing with inquiries arising by way of parliamentary questions.  The costs associated with answering a question can vary considerably depending on the nature of the inquiry and the level of detail that needs to be obtained from local offices of the Department around the country.  The Minister for Finance, replying to a parliamentary question on 13 February 1992, gave the estimated cost of answering a parliamentary question to be about £64.</P>

While on the scheme the unemployed person receives a weekly allowance equivalent to his or her unemployment payment. Persons may also attend other full-time or part-time education courses without infringing the availability for work condition. The third level allowance which was introduced as a pilot scheme in 1990 allows unemployed people to receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments while pursuing full-time third-level courses.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently reviewing the issue of providing encouragement to unemployed people to take up courses of education and training in the context of the area-based response to long term unemployment which is being piloted in 12 areas throughout the country under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>

      <P>It was decided on 3 June 1992 that the person concerned is entitled to free telephone rental allowance.  One of the main conditions for receipt of this allowance is that a person must be living alone (save for children under 15 or with persons who are so permanently incapacitated that they cannot get help in an emergency).  In this case, my Department had to verify the extent of incapacity of the person's spouse, before awarding entitlement.  This information was received on 27 May.</P>

    <P>Although the person concerned has applied to Telecom Éireann for a telephone, <Col N="782" /> it is understood that this has not been installed yet.

      <P>The person concerned was awarded £2,511.85 by the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977. As his former employers failed to pay the award my Department referred the matter to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for consideration as to the institution of legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>The institution of proceedings was, unfortunately, delayed because of protracted doubts that arose in relation to the correct legal title of the employers.</P>
      <P>Legal proceedings were instituted in late 1990 and the case was listed for hearing on 14 March, 1991.  On the application of the employers, the case was adjourned.  Subsequent to the adjournment the employers appealed the tribunal determination to the Circuit Court, where the case was heard in December, 1991.  The court ordered the employers to pay the amount owed.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Chief State Solicitor's Office that as the employers have not complied with the Circuit Court Order, it has now been decided to send it to the Sheriff's office for execution.</P>
