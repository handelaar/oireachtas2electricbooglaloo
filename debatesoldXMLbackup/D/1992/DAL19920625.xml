      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the following matter: the need for the Irish Government to urgently arrange the agreed preparatory meeting for Strand 3 of the Northern Ireland talks process between them and the British Government with observers from the Northern Ireland parties, in view of the fact that the agreed preparatory meeting for Strand 2 has already taken place, that there is a time limit of the end of next month on the entire talks process, and that the good faith and trust generated by the welcome holding of the preparatory meeting for Strand 2 is liable to be dissipated if there is any appearance of delay in arranging this further agreed meeting.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, we are learning nothing other than what we read.  It would be helpful if there was an opportunity to discuss this matter in the House.  As you know, a Cheann Comhairle, I have submitted a Private Notice Question on this topic, but I would ask the Taoiseach if he would consider making time available today because this is an extremely urgent matter and there has been a succession of criticisms of the Government's position.  The Opposition leaders in this House over a number of years have been particularly constructive in terms of the sensitivities of politics of Northern Ireland and we are entitled to some information, either confidentially or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding <Col N="1340" /> £240,035,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1992, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Last week, the people of Ireland made clear their determination that this country should form an integral part of the European Community that will develop in the final years of this century and into the next.  The debate leading to the referendum was, unfortunately, too often sidetracked away from the substantive economic elements of the Maastricht Treaty.  In the event, the electorate cut through peripheral issues to the heart of the matter.  The endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty by the Irish people was a recognition of the benefits which have already flowed to Ireland from our membership of the Community and an acknowledgment that the future development of our economy will best be secured in a Community where trade barriers will continue to be eliminated and we move further towards a single market in the true sense of the word.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Community has been good for Ireland, and without it we would be left in splendid isolation on the edge of Europe with no voice to influence the forces which will largely determine the economic and social development of our country in the decades ahead.  It is true that unemployment is at an unacceptably high level here and poses the single greatest economic and social challenge we face as a people.  But our position would be far worse outside the community.  It is simply not possible for a small, less-developed country today to attempt to build a modern economic structure which has the best possibility of providing adequate employment opportunities and living standards for its people if it remains apart from the mainstream international co-operation and co-ordination <Col N="1341" /> which is at the core of the European Community ideal.</P>
    <P>For Ireland, one of the most important developments within the Community has been the recognition of the need to promote economic and social cohesion in the member states.  This has led to a reform of the Structural Funds with a commitment to Ireland of some £3 billion over the 1989-1993 period.  These funds have supported investment at a far higher level than would otherwise have been the case.  Programmes sponsored by my Department have been major beneficiaries in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Industry represents the single largest programme supported by the Structural Funds here.  It also represents a welcome partnership between the Irish Government and the Commission of the European Communities for the development of Irish industry.  The programme, and the funding made available under it, has supported the creation of over 20,000 jobs per year on average in manufacturing industry and international services since 1989.  It has also contributed to achieving greater cohesion and intergration between the various industrial promotion measures undertaken by the mainstream development agencies such as the IDA, ABT, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta and EOLAS and the industry-related measures undertaken by the Department of Labour, FÁS, the Department of Education and the various educational institutions.  Most importantly, the increased funding made available to improve the marketing and technological capacity of Irish industry will pay dividends in later years in the form of increased output and employment from the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, several important commitments on cohesion are contained in the Maastricht Treaty.  These include a review of the level of funding for structural reform purposes and the application of greater flexibility so that specific needs not at present covered by the funds can be met.  These commitments are particularly important for Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> Deputies will note that in Part II of the Estimate, as published, the costs of &ldquo;Administration&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Services&rdquo; are now shown separately.  Administration expenses relate to those subheads covered by the three year administrative budget agreement between the Minister for Finance and myself and the Secretaries of our respective Departments.</P>
    <P>Essentially, they cover the cost of running the Department of Industry and Commerce, for which in 1992 there will be a budget of £14.4 million.  Salaries account for some 70 per cent of this amount.  I might mention, however, that these costs are offset to a significant extent by a number of income generating areas which are expected to yield some £9 million in 1992.  The bulk of this income will come from the services provided by the Patents Office and the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned how programmes sponsored by my Department benefit from Structural Fund support.  It is expected that this support will amount to over £90 million in respect of expenditure on my Vote &mdash; almost half in respect of the industrial promotion activities of IDA and SFADCo.  These moneys are transmitted directly to the Central Fund so that the figures shown in my Estimate represent the gross cost.</P>
    <P>In the past year there have been a number of changes in the structure of agencies responsible for industrial promotion and marketing.  The Irish Goods Council was merged with Córas Tráchtála to form An Bord Tráchtála, while NADCORP was merged into the Industrial Development Authority.  There have also been fundamental changes in the organisational structure of the Department.</P>
    <P>Prior to November 1991 this structure was based primarily on four line divisions, three of which dealt with functional aspects of industrial development, each with responsibility for one or more State agencies.  The main attraction of this organisational structure was that it provided for a logical and clear-cut division of responsibilities.  However, it also <Col N="1343" /> had a number of significant disadvantages from the point of view of the responsibility of the Department as a whole for industrial policy: programmes tended to be developed and evaluated from a functional perspective rather than from the perspective of the firms the programmes sought to support; The activities of each of the divisions tended to mirror the separate and sometimes conflicting requirements of the agencies for which they were responsible and effective evaluation of the different functional programmes and agencies and of their overall impact was made more difficult.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the main industrial promotion agencies and associated programmes has now been brought together under one division, with separate divisions dealing with industry, commerce, and trade and EC affairs.  A separate, strengthened planning function is also in place.  Industrial policy in a broader sense has become the primary focus of departmental activity and the new structure has improved the Department's internal capacity to develop and review policy for their own programmes and to better influence public policy generally in favour of development needs.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the revised organisational structure will add to my Department's effectiveness and will enable them to better carry through the approach to industrial policy recommended in the report of the Culliton group.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view on a number of occasions since taking responsibility for the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1989 that a fundamental review of industrial policy is required to bring a new and more effective approach to a policy area which is so important in providing employment opportunities and improved living standards for our people. For that reason I established the Industrial Policy Review Group in June of last year and asked them to report within six months on public policy generally as it affects industrial development and to identify measures for adoption which would form the basis for the development of the indigenous sector of Irish industry <Col N="1344" /> over the medium to long term with a view to increasing employment and wealth creation.</P>
    <P>We have had the opportunity to debate the report of the group on a number of occasions in this House.  The group did all they were asked to do and more.  They spelt out in broad terms the main elements of a new industrial strategy for the 1990s and beyond.  Their recommendations generally have received generous and widespread support from all sections of this House and from various interests outside, particularly industry.</P>
    <P>The central theme of the recommendations of the group is that industrial policy needs to be defined widely.  It needs to encompass not only the grants and supports of development agencies, which for too long have masqueraded as industrial policy here, but also other areas of public policy which directly impact on investment decisions in the industrial sector and on the output, productivity and additional value created within Ireland from this investment.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the group are set within such a comprehensive approach to industrial policy.  These recommendations are sensible, practical and mutually supportive.  They cover not only the traditional scope of industrial promotion instruments in the form of grants and incentives but also taxation, education, training, transportation, infrastructure, competition policy and the institutional arrangements for industrial policy formulation and implementation. The logic and force of the recommendations are such that I believe they will be readily adopted in large measure by the Government Departments and State agencies concerned.  The Government have already given their support to the approach adopted by the group.</P>
    <P>A task force comprising the heads of the main Government departments on whom responsibility falls for the implementation of the bulk of the recommendations, together with private sector representatives and an independent chairman, has been established to follow <Col N="1345" /> up on the recommendations.  I am glad that the task force has worked very well in carrying through the Culliton recommendations and I expect very soon to have specific decisions from the Government arising from the work of the task force.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the target is to create 20,000 gross jobs in each year of the programme in manufacturing and international services.  Despite the difficult trading environment, we came close to meeting this in 1991 with the creation of more than 18,500 jobs between the three State agencies &mdash; IDA, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Some 12,500 new first time jobs were created and recruited in new and expanding IDA-backed companies around the country, while a further 3,500 jobs were filled in companies bringing their employment levels back up to their previous peak levels.  The new jobs have arisen equally in Irish and overseas companies. One thousand four hundred jobs were created in the Irish industry sector in the Mid west region, which is the responsibility of Shannon Development, along with 552 new jobs in the Shannon Free Zone.</P>
    <P>During 1991, the IDA succeeded in securing more than 92 new greenfield investments &mdash; 42 of these in manufacturing and international services and 50 in financial services.  This considerable achievement resulted in the IDA substantially maintaining their market share of internationally mobile new business. The improved competitiveness in companies, and in the economy, has also helped the manufacturing base increase its share of international markets resulting in a 3.3 per cent growth in output and an 8 per cent growth in exports, in real terms, during the last year.</P>
    <P>Overseas industry in Ireland continues to deepen its involvement and importance to the economy, with a total annual spend in the economy of almost £4.1 billion, an increase of over 50 per cent in real terms since 1983, while linkages into Irish-owned companies continue to <Col N="1346" /> strengthen, with well in excess of £1 billion per annum now spent on Irish raw materials and components and almost £1.3 billion on Irish services.  Many of the project announcements in 1991 were for expansions, demonstrating that overseas companies are deepening their roots in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Irish-owned medium and large companies, in the non-food sector, are also showing substantial growth in Irish economy expenditures &mdash; since 1987 they have increased their spending in Ireland by 23 per cent to nearly £1.8 billion.  This contrasts sharply with the stagnant trend in the early and mid-eighties.  It also shows the effect of the improved competitiveness of these companies and of the Irish economy in recent years.</P>
    <P>In a number of industry sectors traditionally dominated by Irish companies, a more focused segment approach to business development and marketing has continued to lead to increased exports, despite the general decline in those markets. For example, furniture exports from Irish companies mainly to the UK increased by 8 per cent over the past year, despite a substantial decline in the UK market.</P>
    <P>SFADCo's key results for 1991 included: 1,419 new jobs were created in the Irish industry sector in the region; 552 new jobs were created in the Shannon Free Zone; the company assisted 50 new business start-ups, which together have an employment potential of up to 700; 27 firms at Shannon and in the region's indigenous sector were supported by Shannon Development to carry out expansion programmes, which are expected to result in over 550 new jobs, and infrastructural work commenced on the 110 acre Shannon world aviation park, and work continued on the expansion programme at the national technological park, Plassey.</P>
    <P>In relation to the commerce area, I would like to refer briefly to developments in two areas, legal metrology and investigations under the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>Legal metrology relates to the activities of the weights and measures office of <Col N="1347" /> my Department and the enforcement of weights and measures legislation through the inspectorate, which in the case of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, is provided by the local authorities concerned, while in the rest of the country, this task is performed by Garda sergeants.</P>
    <P>The weights and measures office of my Department is responsible for the approval of new designs of metrological instruments, the provision of national standards, the regular recalibration of inspectors' standards, the general direction of the inspectorate from a technical perspective and generally ensuring that the law is enforced throughout the country. It has become clear in recent years that while the checking procedures are reasonably satisfactory, some of the equipment is inadequate, while the fragmented organisational structure is almost certainly not the most efficient method of enforcement.</P>
    <P>At my Department's request, a detailed examination of the structure and organisation of the service was undertaken last year by the German Metrology Institute with a view to making recommendations as to how best the service could be modernised.  The report of the institute has been received and is currently under consideration.  I would hope to be in a position to take final decisions soon on the revamping of the service.</P>
    <P>I instigated three investigations under the new provisions of the Companies Act, 1990.  One of these is still ongoing and is to investigate and report on the persons who have been financially interested in the success or failure of Hoddle Investments Ltd., and Chestvale Properties Ltd., arising from the purchase by Telecom Éireann of the former Johnston Mooney and O'Brien site at Ballsbridge, Dublin.  The investigation has been subject to an abnormal amount of litigation, including three judicial review proceedings, the judgments on which were in the inspector's favour.  The inspector continues to endeavour to pursue his task vigorously, despite continued litigation, the most recent involving yet further injunction proceedings <Col N="1348" /> taken against the inspector.  As I indicated previously, I believe that procedurally the investigations which have taken place so far have substantially stood the test they faced and have, in practice, demonstrated the usefulness of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>The year 1992 is the first full year of operation of An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; the Irish Trade Board which was created by the Trade and Marketing Promotion Act, 1991.  The board resulted from a merger of Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council and was established to ensure that the State provides marketing support to Irish companies from a single source. The circumstances that face Irish companies both in the local market-place and the wider European market are changing radically.  To survive in these new circumstances, and especially to thrive, our companies must develop and deepen their marketing efforts.  The role of An Bord Tráchtála is to assist companies in this area in the most efficient and costeffective way possible.</P>
    <P>The 1992 Estimate allocation for An Bord Tráchtála of £33.3 million is some £900,000 higher than the 1991 outturn. While the 1992 grant-in-aid is somewhat less than the proposals published in the <i>Programme for Industrial Development 1989-1993,</i> it nonetheless represents an ongoing and continuing commitment by the Government to support the marketing efforts of Irish firms.</P>
    <P>The strength of our successful Irish exporters will lie in differentiation, quality and service.  Successfully following these strategies requires a commitment to marketing, a commitment to identifying customer needs and a commitment to meeting those needs at a profit.  The focus of An Bord Tráchtála's work is about identifying market opportunities for Irish companies and helping them in a developmental way to avail of those opportunities. A good example of this approach is the regional markets programme which was initiated in 1989 and focuses on the most dynamic and fastest growing regions of Europe and the United States of America.  It aims to achieve an intensive involvement for <Col N="1349" /> Irish companies in these regions by facilitating marketing alliances, joint ventures, technology transfers and other forms of co-operative business alliances.</P>
    <P>The application of science and technology to industry is, today, an important element of every successful country's industrial development strategy.  In Ireland, the area was identified as deserving of special attention in 1987, when the Government initiated the special science and technology development programme with a budget for that year of just over £3 million.  Since 1987, this programme has been expanded considerably.  Last year, the allocation for the programme was £22.163 million, and this year £27.336 million is being provided to further expand the scope of the programme. The programme is supported at the maximum EC support rate of 75 per cent, which is an indication that the EC shares our concern at the need to improve in this area.  The science and technology development programme comprises a number of different measures, including programmes in advanced technology, higher education &mdash; industry linkages and regional infrastructure development.</P>
    <P>The first priority for industrial development must be the maintenance of an internationally competitive operating environment for industry.  If we can combine the competitive advantages gained through the social partnership programmes of the past four years with a more sharply focused national approach to key industrial and international service sectors, I believe that companies can continue their structured programmes of growth in European and other world markets.  Increasing Irish companies' market share in Europe is the only way forward to sustainable job-creation in Ireland.  One of the most important conclusions of the Industrial Policy Review Group was that there are, &ldquo;no single policy actions that can ensure a quick solution to the problem of unemployment&rdquo;. Our emphasis will be on building skills and competitive strengths as far as possible in and throughout the markets.  The role of the State will be to support and facilitate that process by <Col N="1350" /> helping firms to upgrade their capabilities to serve and compete in defined markets and to help create the environment which encourages the investment in industrial projects necessary for firms to achieve their potential for growth and development and which will sustain existing employment and create new job opportunities throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the House for the fact that I have to leave the debate to attend a Cabinet meeting that started at 11 a.m. It is not my wish to leave and I apologise particularly to the Deputies who will be contributing.  I will be more than ably represented by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, who will reply, and I will read the proceedings of the debate later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's wish to attend a Cabinet meeting.  I will be asking a number of questions to which the Minister of State may reply.  I am intrigued that the Minister devoted so much time to legal metrology.  This is not listed in the State directory as one of the functions of his Department, yet he appears to consider it a very important function.  Perhaps the Minister of State would say why the Book of Estimates does not provide any sum for legal metrology in 1991, while almost £600,000 is provided for this year.  There must be some significance in the Minister's bringing this to the attention of the House. Perhaps the background will be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the first occasions since the publication of the Culliton report and the implementation of the Finance Act that I have had the opportunity of addressing this House on matters pertaining to business.  I wish first to reinforce the point made this morning by Deputy Quinn and on a number of occasions by Deputy Noonan about the importance to the business community of the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill.  This year the transcript of that debate will not be available until the autumn to accounting firms, solicitors and business generally to enable them to <Col N="1351" /> understand the fine print of the Finance Act.</P>
    <P>I say this while you, a Cheann Comhairle, are in the Chair because the staffing arrangements of this House are very inadequate and I expect you as the Chairman of this House to go to the Government and see that the various committees of the House are properly staffed so that they can function efficiently.  This applies also to the committee of which I am Chairman, the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  We were allocated staff some 12 months ago but they were hardly hot in their seats when they were borrowed for other committees.  No one committee is properly served; neither is any section of the House.  Some of the people who were meant to serve the Joint Committee on European Affairs were engaged in serving the Special Committee on the Finance Bill which was meeting at the same time.  We cannot function and serve democracy properly unless this House is properly funded and staffed.</P>
    <P>In this case I am speaking to the Chair, who will apreciate the point since he has received many representations from the political parties.  If we are to operate as a proper Parliament and oversee the flood of legislation and proposals from the European Community, the committee of which I am Chairman, and all the committees of the House and this Chamber, must be properly staffed. Transcripts of debates must be made available to interested parties.  The most important legislation we have passed is the Finance Bill and it will be three months before the transcript of the debate is available.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report set out an analysis of existing policy and pointed to certain institutional policy changes required to improve policy towards business.  The Government set up a task force to look at the implementation of these proposals but as yet, six months after the publication of the report, we have not seen action.  The Minister said he expects to <Col N="1352" /> have decisions taken shortly in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government also set up last year an interdepartmental committee on employment but we have heard nothing from that committee.  Tourism, for some strange reason, was excluded from the Review of Industrial Policy, even though it is one of our largest international services. Having realised their omission in this regard, the Government set up a task force on tourism from which nothing has emerged since its establishment six months ago.</P>
    <P>The Government also sabotaged the Fine Gael proposal for an independently chaired forum on jobs which would meet outside the politically charged atmosphere of the Oireachtas.  It was our intention that in that forum public representatives would attend, as in the case of the New Ireland Forum, as members of political parties, drawing on submissions by groupings who have views on the jobs crisis.  It was intended by us in Fine Gael that, as with the New Ireland Forum, the jobs forum would not meet as Government and Opposition.  It was intended that Ministers would attend as politicians with power to act but not as spokespersons for their Departments. The Government's jobs committee which was set up to sabotage the Fine Gael proposal on a jobs forum is a toothless wonder and they have so far made no impact on the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government, before making decisions on future policy towards industry, to consider the issues and proposals raised in the Fine Gael policy document &ldquo;Towards a Jobs Economy&rdquo; which was published last month.  This is a comprehensive view of the jobs economy which contains very firm proposals.  It is extraordinary that an Opposition party can produce a document of that detail containing a long list of suggestions in a very limited period.  The Government, with all their resources, having set up three or four committees, have produced nothing in the same period.  We can do it within a few weeks but the Government cannot do it within 12 months.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to give foreign- <Col N="1353" /> based enterprises higher levels of assistance than home-based businesses, as suggested in the Culliton report.  I have listed the arguments before and I will not repeat them.  I do not believe that the country of ownership is a valid basis for assessing the level of assistance which should be provided.  In any event, to make decisions on State assistance to enterprises on the basis of the country of ownership is likely to be interpreted as being against the spirit of European competition law and possibly illegal.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the agencies for assisting business should be divided into one dealing with foreign business and one dealing with indigenous business as suggested by Culliton.  The agencies giving support to business should be split on the grounds of specialised functions, not on the basis of the country of ownership of those businesses which they are assisting.  Fine Gael propose to establish one agency to promote and encourage investment and one agency to develop and support marketing capabilities.  That approach is much more logical and more likely to produce results than the strategy suggested by Culliton.  There are large parts of the report with which I agree but these are two areas where I do not agree.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would indicate when decisions on implementing the Culliton report are to be taken and announced as there is considerable uncertainty being generated as to what future policy holds for business. The Minister when replying might give some information in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the midst of the establishment of all these committees and task forces on employment and industrial policy from which nothing has yet emerged, the Government introduced a budget and a Finance Bill which demonstrated a blatant anti-business attitude.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce and also as somebody whom, in fairness, I felt always had a high regard for the need to encourage enterprise in this country, I fail to see how he not only supported but actually tried to claim credit for the budget strategy in the Finance Act that implemented it.  The budget was inspired <Col N="1354" /> by the dual aims of meeting the Progressive Democrats' demands for lower tax rates and by getting public servants to stave off pay increases which had already been granted to them by the Minister for Finance in his earlier role as Minister for Labour.  The Minister for Finance took his revenge on the Progressive Democrats by giving in to the tax rate demands but at the cost of an anti-business budget strategy.</P>
    <P>Incentives to encourage enterprise and risk taking were removed across the board irrespective of any assessment of the benefits which they brought.  In addition, the Minister granted additional powers to the Revenue Commissioners although it was plain to see that the Revenue Commissioners do not utilise the full powers which they already have.  To rub salt into the wounds the Minister for Finance had the audacity to claim on radio that the reason he was granting additional powers to the Revenue Commissioners arose from what he termed &ldquo;business scandals&rdquo;.  All of those so-called scandals &mdash; and the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to them this morning &mdash; took place not in business transactions within the private sector but rather where they were an interface with the public sector.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sugar Company, Telecom Éireann and the export credit insurance issues all operated in the public sector at the time of these alleged scandals.  Yet this is the excuse the Minister for Finance uses for giving increased powers to the Revenue Commissioners.  All of these scandals &mdash; I have had to point this out on a number of occasions &mdash; did not relate to the private sector but to the public State-owned sector.  Rather than setting up the private sector as a bogeyman the Minister for Finance and the Government would be better occupied ensuring proper supervision of Government activities and enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance seems to believe that everybody engaged in private sector activity is part of some big business conspiracy to rip off the consumer. Many people engaged in the private sector are self-employed, either <Col N="1355" /> operating on their own or employing small numbers of people.  They operate under tremendous pressures and very often make little or modest sums of money despite long hours of work.  These aspects of being in business on one's own do not seem to cross the minds of the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce who should have been making the points I am now making at the Cabinet table instead of agreeing to the 1992 anti-business budget.  To offer a tax rate of 10 per cent for placing your money on deposit in a savings account may be attractive to a civil servant in the Department of Finance but it hardly compares with the risks involved in borrowing money to try to establish a business which will employ people.  The attitude of the Minister for Finance towards investment is a criticism which has been voiced over and over again by all sections of the business community. The perverse sense of where incentives are needed in Ireland, underlying this budget, was indicative of an anti-business attitude which ran right through the Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The publicity surrounding inquiries and tribunals in Ireland is having a negative impact on the image of doing business here.  I am sorry to have to say that is true.  This is not to say that such inquiries should not be carried out.  It does, however, point to a major indirect cost which they have on the image of Ireland and on business performance. Whether the cost is worth while will depend on the outcome of the inquiries and the extent to which they can help establish accurately not only what went on, but also why and how various happenings might have occurred and, more importantly, how wrongdoings, if any occurred, can be prevented in the future.</P>
    <P>Unless the inquiries come up with the goods on these matters they will have been expensive not only in terms of the direct costs of carrying them out but also indirectly in terms of the damage done to the image of Irish business, both at home and abroad.  Comments by Ministers without being in possession of the full <Col N="1356" /> facts in advance of the findings of the inquiries are not helpful.</P>
    <P>The apparent manner in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has behaved during the course of the inquiries suggests a certain vindictiveness, the carping attitude he has adopted and the number of times he is alleged to have telephoned one of the inspectors in the inquiry has done very little to restore people's confidence in the way the State controls affairs within its own remit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>You will be glad to hear I am finished with the subject.  It is on ensuring that laxity in administrative and supervisory procedures do not allow opportunities for wrongdoing to exist that attention must now be focused.  Provided the systems and structures are in place and there are people to operate them, there should be no scope for individuals wrongfully to make large gains at the expense of their own company or of those with whom they are doing business. I hope that the results of the various inquiries and tribunals will undo the damage which the process of carrying out the inquiries and tribunals is causing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to turn to another issue for which the Minister has responsibility, namely, competition policy.  When the Competition Act was introduced last year and guillotined through this House without allowing for adequate discussion on it, I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that there would be many occasions where businesses would be reluctant to take on a large company in seeking an injunction to prevent what may be termed as &ldquo;an abuse of a dominant position&rdquo; or other actions which would be contrary to the Competition Act.  The practical difficulties in business in Ireland is that people are reluctant to engage in legal redress against large potential customers or suppliers.  A number of such instances have been brought to my attention since the debate on the Competition Act last year.  That is one of the dangers <Col N="1357" /> of importing &mdash; as this Act has done &mdash; European legislation into a small country like Ireland.  What may be adequate or suitable and may operate in America, Britain, Germany or France will not operate in a small country like Ireland where everybody as it were takes in each other's washing, where we all know one another.  It is not satisfactory to expect small companies who feel they are being wronged to take large companies to court where they would hope, sometime in the future, to be a customer or a supplier to that large company.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Competition Act for the Minister to make references to the competition authority under section 11 of the Act.  He may make a request for a study and analysis to be carried out by the competition authority. Can the Minister of State tell me &mdash; on the Minister's behalf &mdash; whether the Minister has made any such requests, in respect of which matters he has done so, and whether he will publish the reports of any studies and analysis carried out since the Act was introduced?  I would also like to know what is the procedure by which the Minister decides to make a request to the competition authority.  Does he get representations?  Do his civil servants say he should do it?  Do the competition authority come back and say: &ldquo;If you ask us to investigate this then we will do it&rdquo;?  I would like to know how that is done.</P>
    <P>Under section 14 of the Competition Act the Minister may make requests to the competition authority to carry out an investigation as to whether there has been an abuse of a dominant position. Again, I would like to know whether the Minister has made any such requests in the past year and what were the findings from such investigations.  No procedure is laid down in the Act and I would like to know what procedure he uses when he is seeking such an investigation.</P>
    <P>As a result of representations made me a number of businesses I would like the Minister to consider whether he will make a request to the competition authority under section 14 in a particular matter which I will list here.  The State has a monopoly in the supply of telecommunications <Col N="1358" /> service through Telecom Éireann.  That company are engaged in a joint venture in supplying a security alarm system to households in Ireland which operates on a radio controlled basis through the telephone service. Many small operators within the security alarm business are concerned at the extent of the marketing and advertising being carried out by the new company in which Telecom Éireann are involved.</P>
    <P>The fact that Telecom Éireann rely in this new company on their own name and their own logo, and make references in their brochures to the fact that some other businesses in this sector might not be as trustworthy as Telecom, has led to concern that Telecom Éireann are abusing a dominant position.  Given the relative size of Telecom Éireann and the smaller operators within the security alarm business, it is not surprising that there is a reluctance to engage in the cost of going to court in order to establish whether an abuse exists.  Furthermore, many of the security alarm systems people might see themselves as either suppliers to or customers of Telecom Éireann in the future and again are reluctant on these grounds to take any action through the courts.  On the basis of what I have said, would the Minister consider making a request to the competition authority under section 14 to have the security alarm business investigated and in particular to establish whether Telecom Éireann's activities in this sphere constitute an abuse of a dominant position? That is one of the points that was raised in the House.  I understood that at the time the Minister gave an undertaking that State companies and local authorities were included under the provisions of the Competition Act.  From what has happened since, it is clear that they are not.</P>
    <P>In relation to the future of business in Ireland, I am pleased that the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty was carried.  The emphasis must switch away from the funds that can be obtained from Europe towards the opportunities that should exist within Europe for businesses in Ireland.  In order for businesses in <Col N="1359" /> Ireland to be fully capable of availing of the opportunities that exist it is important that all information regarding the European Community and other international issues is freely available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do that.  I should like to make one final comment.  One criticism heard frequently during the campaign on the Maastricht Treaty referendum was that there was a lack of information and that the Government had failed to inform the people generally of what was involved in the Maastricht Treaty.  Exactly the same thing is happening in relation to business and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  The agricultural sector is the only sector receiving attention under GATT. It is important to remove the uncertainty in the business community.  The Government should engage in a process of giving information to business on precisely what is involved and what opportunities are available to business and sectors other than the agricultural sector.  In this regard I hope that the Minister might consider publishing a White Paper for business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an appropriate time to pass comment on the performance of a Minister in charge of what ought to be one of the most central and dynamic Government Departments, expecially at a time when the structural challenges facing our economy have contributed to the worst unemployment record in the history of the State.  Unfortunately &mdash; tragically so far as the unemployed are concerned &mdash; today we are talking about the invisible Department and the invisible Minister.  He is the Minister who commissioned the Culliton report and since publication of that report he has worn it as if it were the laurels worn by ancient emperors. However, the Minister is yet to actually do anything about the institutional, legislative or policy changes recommended by <Col N="1360" /> the report.  If the report ever forms a monument to the Minister, it will be a monument to his inactivity.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the Culliton report and its implications in some detail, because the report is so important for the unemployment crisis.  There are other matters to which I also want to refer, such as the inquiries set up by the Minister.  If time permits after I have dealt with the unemployment crisis, which is our major crisis, I intend to say a few words about those inquiries and the Minister's involvement in them.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment some years ago of the Department of Labour and the apparent responsibility of that Department to publish the unemployment figures, the focus and the responsibility for unemployment have moved away from the Department that is relevant to the whole issue with the result that when rising unemployment figures are published we hear comments from the Department of Labour and the Minister for Labour while very little, if anything, is said by the Minister responsible for unemployment.  The only thing done has been a juggling with the unemployment figures, a change in the rules by which the figures are calculated, in order to provide an artificially low figure.  Such a practice certainly will not solve the problem. In the face of the appalling human crisis of unemployment and the certainty that the crisis will get worse as the years go on, it is time that the Government parties began to realise that the unemployment crisis cannot be addressed if they continue to think of the issue as one that can be swept under the carpet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowadays it is noticeable that Fianna Fáil have simply stopped talking about the crisis.  Of course, the Progressive Democrats never even began to talk about the crisis other than to issue the usual bland comments about confidence in the economy and tax reform for the better off.  For years most other parties in the House have consistently adopted the view that if the Government created the climate the jobs would follow.  We have heard that statement over and over again.  However, that has not happened. <Col N="1361" /> It is only now that there is beginning to be an acceptance that the policies followed have been a complete failure.  We in the Labour Party have campaigned for a long time to persuade the Government to intervene in the jobs crisis in several ways.  We have argued that the most important intervention the Government could now take would be to start building a consensus around the issue to make sure that unemployment becomes the number one priority for the State and the community.</P>
    <P>Building a consensus has always implied very firmly that the Government should expand and build on the social partnership model in place at the moment to enable other forces in the community to contribute to solutions.  That is why in the past the Labour Party have called for a new partnership on jobs, a radical development and extension of the social partnership model to encompass an objective and detailed analysis of the problem and a new approach to solutions. That is also why the Labour Party put so much work into efforts to get off the ground an all-party committee on unemployment, a committee based on a structure that would enable the inclusion of all the key players and having terms of reference that would enable the development of consensus for radical change.</P>
    <P>Most objective commentators examining the structure that has emerged from discussions between the Labour Party and the Government will recognise that the Labour Party have made a major input in the framing of those terms.  Of course, the terms are not perfect.  We have made compromises to try to secure for discussion a model that reflects the different objectives of all of the parties involved.  It is also true to say that the jobs committee now set up entails a degree of risk, especially for Opposition parties, whose instinct and role is to oppose.  To my memory, this is the first official document to be distributed by this Government &mdash; and by that I mean any Government going back to 1987 &mdash; which uses the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; in relation to unemployment.  This is the first time that <Col N="1362" /> a committee structure has been established with the consent of the Government that cannot be dominated by the Government themselves.  Above all, this is the first time in the history of the State that an agreement between political parties leaves room and scope for the unemployed, the voluntary agencies, the unions, the farmers, the employers and the young people to sit down together and make Government policy.</P>
    <P>There should be no mistake about it, if this committee and their working subcommittees develop a consensus on strategic policies, the Government will ignore that consensus at their peril.  The Labour Party would have preferred a wider and more embracing structure and we would have preferred more detailed terms of reference.  We chose to compromise for one reason only, because the crisis is so serious.  Without consensus and without the Government and the Opposition modifying their ideological positions, the crisis will get worse.  With consensus there is a possibility that we will be able to do some of the difficult things that need to be done.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is at the core of many of our fiscal problems.  For example, the budget overrun this year will be largely accounted for by the excess spending on unemployment related payments.  Unemployment is also at the core of the grinding poverty that afflicts thousands of families.  It is at the core of many of our mounting health bills, contributing as it does to thousands of cases of depression, stress-related conditions, violence, alcoholism and a host of other conditions. Most of all, unemployment is at the core of our equality crisis.  It is not an accident that unemployment is at its highest in many of the devastated and alienated suburbs of our larger cities and towns.  It is not an accident that unemployment is at highest where access to education is poorest.  It is not an accident that unemployment, poverty and disadvantage form part of a never-ending vicious circle of inequality.</P>
    <P>There should be no misunderstanding about two central issues in this regard. First, there is a clear cause and effect <Col N="1363" /> relationship between unemployment, poverty and discrimination on the one hand and community breakdown on the other.  By refusing to face up to unemployment we are creating a permanently marginalised, disenfranchised community. Second, the insult of unemployment becomes an obscenity when Government try to pretend that little or nothing can or should be done.  That is what the Government, elected to represent us, have been trying to do.  I am not pretending that a magic wand will solve the problem &mdash; to say that would be dishonest &mdash; but we must start from the point that a figure heading rapidly towards 300,000 unemployed is totally unacceptable on any kind of economic or social basis.  It is all the more unacceptable in the context of a prosperous Europe in which our unemployment rate is by far the worst, almost twice the European average and many times more than a country like Portugal, which is regarded as one of the poorer countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>If we had started from that point some years ago instead of trying to secretly export the problem, the problem would not be as grim today.  We must recognise that crucial steps can and must be taken &mdash; some big, some small, some immediate and others long term.  This is where I take issue with the central thesis of the Culliton report, which contains on its cover the assertion that there are no short term options and that no immediate response is possible.  We recognise, of course, that the creation of 300,000 net extra jobs will not be implemented in the short term, but that is a far cry from saying that nothing can be done right now.</P>
    <P>We approach the Culliton report from the perspective of a party who believe in full employment as a policy goal.  I say that without an apology to anyone.  We recognise that the whole concept of full employment requires elaboration and clarification.  However, to those who regard the notion as fanciful, there are a number of countries whose employment performance has always been much better than ours &mdash; Japan, Switzerland, <Col N="1364" /> Sweden and Austria, to name a few &mdash; and people should ask what these countries have in common.  They all share an underlying consensus based on values that regard unemployment as destructive. They all share values which suggest that full employment must be a central objective for Government, business, trade unions and the self-employed.  In all these countries, these belief systems are actualised in national institutions where vital decisions are made on economic and social policy.</P>
    <P>In all these countries, unemployment strategies vary considerably.  Japan and, interestingly, Sweden have relied heavily in the past on the private sector.  Austria, on the other hand, has used the public sector as an engine for employment growth.  However, there has been one common thread in all these economies in the past: unemployment strategies have concentrated on targeted interventions to prevent the unemployed from becoming marginalised in the economy and to place them in vacancies rather than relying exclusively on general economic growth to deal with the problem through increasing employment.  If we rely exclusively on growth and if we hope that it will somehow translate itself into jobs, we will wait for ever.  I do not believe that we can afford to wait for ever and that is why we must concentrate on key areas where the issue of unemployment can be tackled head on.</P>
    <P>In doing so we must recognise two basic principles.  The first is that the creation of extra wealth in Ireland is crucial and that the retention of that wealth, translating it into jobs here at home, is equally crucial.  The second is that the way to do that is to secure a lot more added value from everything we do. Catching fish will never produce as much wealth or as many jobs as turning the catch into fish fingers.  The third principle is that we should not be prepared to wait for the medium term, because we can do a great many things in the short term.  I will give a couple of examples which we have spelt out in debates like this before. One is in the area of curbing voluntary redundancies.  New directions in policy <Col N="1365" /> require certain specific changes in our whole approach to employment, the distribution of work opportunities and investment, if industrial expansion and additional wealth are to be channelled into jobs.</P>
    <P>To ensure the retention of the maximum number of jobs in industry and services, employers and employees must be given incentives to opt for retraining, redeployment and work sharing instead of resorting to redundancy in the case of profitable enterprises.  The Government can do a lot more in the whole area of redeployment and work sharing, because there is resistance to that concept in certain State employment.  In one recent year 20,000 new jobs were created, but 23,000 jobs were lost through redundancy. The banks, major multi-national companies and some of our public enterprises have paid out vast sums in redundancy payments for the purpose of maximising profits in some cases instead of saving the remaining jobs.  This practice must be stopped.  We have already produced a policy to counteract it in our work reorganisation scheme, which aims to save 10,000 jobs each year through a combination of the measures I outlined.</P>
    <P>Justice in the context of wealth creation and expansion of employment must give priority to the long term unemployed. It is a simple but tragic fact that the longer an individual is out of employment the harder it is for him or her to break back into employment.  Unless that vicious circle is addressed, relatively young men and women will never work again.  We have consistently called for all negotiations between the Government, employers and trade unions to include an agreement to allocate a significant proportion of all vacancies in the private sector over a three to five year period to people who are long term unemployed. It is worth repeating this call at every opportunity and again making the point that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is supposed to be about more than pay.  One of the issues to which it pays most lip service is unemployment, but so far lip service is all that it has been.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate a scheme of <Col N="1366" /> priority for the long term unemployed we have already proposed that the employment incentive scheme should be reformed as follows.  It should be targeted at the long term unemployed, that is, those out of work for at least 12 months, and the payments should be increased to £120 per week in the first year, £100 per week in the second year and £90 per week in the third year.  The scheme we have suggested would be budgeted to eliminate long term unemployment over a five to seven year period, with 20,000 being assisted in each of the first three years.  Retraining would be guaranteed under the European Social Fund.  Our scheme would involve additional gross expenditure by the State; but that, in turn, would be considerably reduced by savings in social welfare payments.  These are only a number of ideas.  Other parties, the social partners and organisations representing the unemployed have put forward others and during the coming months we will be spelling out more in specific areas.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, whatever our reservations, the Labour Party are prepared to welcome the framework set out by the Culliton review group as a way of moving forward.  We are determined to play our part in generating ideas and in helping to build a consensus to ensure that the unemployment crisis remains at the top of the political agenda.  Above all, I urge the Minister responsible for implementing the Culliton report to stop talking and start acting.  There is far too much work to be done and a start on that work is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to speak in the 1992 Estimates debate and to augment the information on trade and marketing provided earlier by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is very appropriate at this time, when the Irish people have voted so convincingly to be part of the new European structures, that I should look at the broad picture of our export performance in Europe.  I should say that when I come <Col N="1367" /> to wind up the debate I will be glad to respond to the various queries posed by Deputies.</P>
      <P>In 1973, the year Ireland joined the European Community, the value of our annual exports was £869 million; today they are in the region of £15 billion.  The destination of our exports has shifted dramatically.  In the fifties three-quarters of our exports were to Britain; today Britain accounts for only about one-third of our total exports.  Our trade now is overwhelmingly with the European Community, which of course includes Britain. It is the European Community that now takes more than three-quarters of our exports.  Two-thirds of our people employed in manufacturing are directly concerned in exports and there are few people in Ireland today whose economic wellbeing is not affected by the level of our success in external trade.</P>
      <P>In recent decades the inward looking, protectionist philosophy of the thirties and forties has finally been laid to rest. In its place we have built on outward looking, open economy.  We are building a new tradition based on a strong belief in the unfettered movement between countries of goods, capital and people. In the sixties we achieved free trade with Britain, in the seventies we joined the European Community and now we have voted to endorse that decision.</P>
      <P>Turning now to the overall trend in marketing, expenditure from 1988 to the present time has increased significantly, due largely to Structural Funds support. In 1988 the combined grant-in-aid to Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council was £20.7 million while this year the figure if £33.3 million.  The level of expenditure is a strong indication of the Government's commitment to developing a strong marketing capability in Irish companies, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises.  In the speech that I have circulated I outline the rate of increase in both moneys and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth in indigenous exports is perhaps the single greatest success story of the economy in recent years.  Irish <Col N="1368" /> exports are now found in over 120 countries worldwide.  I am glad that the latest CSO figures demonstrate that the excellent growth trend of recent years is continuing. Exports for the first four months of 1992 reached a record level of £5,364 million, which represents an increase of 15 per cent on the same period in 1991. That is a considerable growth rate and will be welcomed on all sides of the House.  We must try to build on this figure.  As I said, the strength of indigenous companies lies in their employment performance and we must help them to build a strong marketing capability.</P>
    <P>In this respect various programmes are operated by An Bord Tráchtála.  In the modern highly competitive world in which Irish goods seek their niche companies need a level of sophistication in marketing which was not necessary a decade ago.  In the world of high value-added products in which we trade, finding a market niche is no longer simply responding to a stated customer demand. Instead, it means foreseeing demand and developing products to meet that demand in advance of an articulated customer requirement.  This means that companies must have top class people who understand not just where modern technology and production methods are going but can combine these two skills.</P>
    <P>In relation to import substitution, as Members of the House will know, the Government are prohibited by the 1982 European Court judgment from promoting a specific &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. Instead Government policy, as implemented by An Bord Tráchtála, has been to concentrate on helping indigenous companies to develop a professional domestic marketing capability through programmes such as the sectoral promotions and industrial sub-contract service. Again, in the speech I have circulated I go on to refer to both those schemes in greater detail outlining what the targets and strategies are.  Under the sub-contract programme An Bord Tráchtála work with industrial purchasers and sub-suppliers to help win new business for Irish firms trying to supply industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> In relation to trade development between North and South, the week before last we had an interesting debate in the House on a motion which was put forward by Fine Gael on the need to devise strategies for trade development between North and South.  There was a measure of consensus on all sides of the House and no disagreement.  In relation to the debate on the Maastricht Treaty, emphasis was placed on the effect greater European intergration would have on trade between North and South with regard to our industrial policies.  In recent times very many eminent figures and representatives of the business communities, North and South, have signalled their recognition of the new opportunities now available to us in Ireland, North and South, to work together to strengthen the economies of both parts of the island.  It does not need to be explained that if we on this island can work together as one economic unit and remove economic barriers between North and South, as time goes on barriers of all kinds, be they psychological or physical, should dissipate. It cannot be denied that a strong economic argument can be made in favour of Ireland putting itself forward as one economic unit in both Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Board in the North and An Bord Tráchtála have increased their co-operation in recent years, both to further develop the flow of trade between the two parts of this island and to jointly increase the exports from the island of Ireland.  Recently I met my newly appointed counterpart, Mr. Robert Atkins MP, in Belfast where we visited a North-South trade exhibition. He is due to visit Waterford in October. Arrangements for this visit are currently being made.  We should openly express what we often say and feel deeply, and the best way to go about this is to arrange visits, both North and South.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude my remarks on the marketing grant-in-aid by saying that 1992 is the first full year of operation of An Bord Tráchtála which was created by the merger of Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council.  It was a wise <Col N="1370" /> decision to merge these two agencies having regard to their performance in their first year of trading and the strong input that they have had in devising marketing strategies.  I have been enormously heartened by and believe strongly in the activities of An Bord Tráchtála, and the expertise and business acumen available to them which they use to very good effect.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of the EC has brought many advantages to our consumers which will continue and be strengthened by the Maastricht Treaty.  I should like to refer to the protection of consumers, catered for by a wide spread of legislation constantly undergoing improvement and updating.  For example, a new Consumer Credit Bill will be introduced this year whose provisions will cover the broad spectrum of credit business.  It will also lay down rules applying to agreements under which credit is supplied to private consumers, especially moneylending agreements.  The main effect of the provisions of this Bill will be to better inform our consumers of the commitment being undertaken and also to lay down technical rules for their protection.</P>
    <P>The three-year plan of the EC Commission on consumer policy, which involved widespread consultation with all affected interests, seeks to help consumers realise the full economic benefits of the internal market.  It sets out future priorities for the development of consumer policy within the Community in addition to proposals to boost measures in the areas of consumer representation, information, safety and transactions.  I am pleased that the brief of the Director of Consumer Affairs is linked with trade and marketing.  I believe strongly that high standards of quality and value are the common cause of producer and consumer alike.  I perceive no tension, real or imagined, within the two arms of that brief.  Surely high standards are what manufacturers and consumers want achieved.  This means they have a common objective.</P>
    <P>One of the strongest messages to <Col N="1371" /> emerge from the recent referendum campaign, to which Deputy Barry alluded, and from the widespread debate in other countries was the need to make the workings of Europe more understandable, accountable and relevant to its citizens. I aim to do this in my area through easier and greater access to consumer education and information.  I will be working towards the formulation and adoption of a consumer's charter in which people's needs will be foremost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The eighties was a decade of unremitting job losses.  Indeed, Deputy Pattison was quite right to draw attention to the fact that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce has been in office now for three years during which period the figures for unemployment have culminated in being the worst in the history of this State.  The fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce somehow is perceived in the public eye to be the guardian of high standards in Government has managed to steer attention away from his main responsibility, which is tackling that jobs crisis.</P>
      <P>In the House here yesterday the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, answering a parliamentary question about the figures on the live register, admitted that had they been compiled on the same basis as in March 1990 that figure would now have reached 288,705.  It is beyond the wildest, most pessimistic view of all of us that we should ever have an unemployment rate here of that level.  That is all the more unacceptable after a decade of unremitting job losses in Irish industry, when the shake-out went on at an average of approximately 20,000 jobs annually &mdash; indeed, slightly in excess of that number of jobs were lost in Irish industry over the eighties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has engaged in holding out to us the prospect of a review of industrial performance in the Culliton report and by the task force now sitting on how to implement their recommendations and so on.  By and large, that <Col N="1372" /> has not the Minister past three years' responsibility for this jobs crisis.  But very little coherent action has been taken.</P>
    <P>It is not quite accurate of the Minister to say, as he did in the course of his introductory remarks this morning, that we have had an opportunity in this House to discuss the question of industrial policy on many occasions.  We have not.  Indeed, on the occasions on which we have had an opportunity, the Minister managed, as he has done again this morning, to absent himself.  Indeed, he is the only Minister I have ever marked, so to speak, who makes himself so scarce.  Whether that be a comment on the value of the contribution of the rest of us or that he is an inordinately busy Minister, I cannot say.</P>

      <P>The net point is that our unemployment position is worsening.  If the Minister is seriously setting about implementing in some coherent, overall planned fashion the recommendations of Culliton, then it is about time we addressed that issue and quickly.</P>
      <P>I do not have the same confidence &mdash; I speak now as a member of the almost all-party Oireachtas Committee on Employment &mdash; as does Deputy Pattison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> I have agreed from the very beginning with the Fine Gael criticism that without Ministers attending it is likely to be less effective than it would have been otherwise. Nonetheless, the crisis is so bad that we cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in this House and not participate in combining whatever ingenuity we have to come up with proposals that would have some impact on the extent of that crisis. But we would be assisted in our conclusions were the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for example, to attend in accordance with his schedule and enable us to prepare quickly recommendations for implementation in the short term.  The question of policy review in the medium and longer term is in other hands.</P>
    <P>I might also refer to the Minister's remarks, which I thought demonstrated a certain intolerance of people, about his regret that the Maastricht debate was not devoted to what he called the substantive economic issues &mdash;&ldquo;substantive&rdquo; seems to be becoming a great word now.  The Minister deplored the peripheral issues that detracted from that debate.  First of all, I do not consider issues like defence or the Protocol were peripheral.  Second, I do not think one can blame any other body for having to contend with the impact of the Protocol.  That was not our fault; it was the responsibility of Government. I do not want to go back over that debate except to say it is a pity that the Minister did not take up the point made by my party Leader this morning, or that his officials did not choose to respond to a relevant economic point concerning the Maastricht Treaty, which was in yesterday's briefing by the president of the Commission Monsieur Delors, he pointed out that he was now moderating his expectations in terms of the Cohesion Fund and preparing a proposal for the spread of those funds over seven years.  I should have thought that was a material point on which the Minister for Industry and Commerce might have given us his views having regard to the fact that it was one of the main prizes held out to the people &mdash; in rather simplistic fashion, at <Col N="1374" /> least initially &mdash; during the debate on the Maastricht Referendum.</P>
    <P>May I say also that one of the Major defects of the Maastricht Treaty, which was one of the principal reasons Democratic Left sought to have it renegotiated, was the absence of any common industrial policy, or any policy on jobs that would adequately tackle the question of the weaker peripheral economies and the transfer of resources from the centre to these peripheral economies.  That was one of the principal issues on which we sought renegotiation.  Notwithstanding that, I agree that we must not become fatalistic about unemployment or allow ourselves to be intimidated by the sheer size of the problem.  Other small fringe economies have managed to create sustained jobs for their people.  With energy, imagination and the right mix of policies we can do the same.  All potential areas of job creation must be developed.  There is scope for additional jobs in the services sector, but it is noteworthy that the figure for jobs in the manufacturing sector of 220,000 in 1971 remains precisely the same in 1991.  A huge loss in the agricultural area has been offset by a huge gain in the services area, but in the manufacturing area the figure remains at 220,000 in 1991.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve the goal of an enterprising and competitive economy certain minimum steps are necessary.  We must have a planned and co-ordinated industrial development strategy spearheaded by the Government and, as Culliton recommends, spearheaded specifically by a Department more focused than the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It should involve the full participation and co-operation of both publicly and privately owned enterprises along with the relevant State agencies. There will have to be specific targeting of industrial sectors with a potential for the large scale creation of lasting jobs such as in the food sector, biotechnology and computer software.  There should be an energising and supervision of industrial strategy by a statutory body representative of the Oireachtas, the business community, trade unions, the <Col N="1375" /> unemployed, women's organisations and other interest groups with the independence and political authority to produce rapid and radical action.  There should be full workforce involvement at all levels and stages of every project, to unleash the potential creativity and commitment that has been stifled by traditional industrial structures, and major changes in the way income support is provided to both firms and individuals. This means putting personal tax and social welfare on to the industrial agenda as well as corporate taxation.  Ireland's extensive and well developed financial professional research and training facilities must be focused on cultivating these targeted industrial sectors.  Each sector should be allocated a special task force to help co-ordinate its development.</P>
    <P>My main hope for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment is that it will enable us to secure a political mandate to implement certain short term job creation strategies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. Following the points Deputy Rabbitte made, I would like to appeal to the Fine Gael Party to participate in the Oireachtas jobs forum.  This is a golden opportunity for them to be fully involved in an all-party arrangement on the most serious issue facing the Irish people today, the level of unemployment and the need to create employment.  The Fine Gael Party are neglecting their responsibilities to the unemployed by not participating in this forum.  I wish the Chairman, Deputy Hillery, and the Members of the forum well in their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the job creation policies of the Department and the Government, the western constituency which I represent has not fared very well.  The Rohan advance factory in Roscommon town has been idle for more than ten years.  I appreciate that negotiations are at an advanced stage in the Department to attract an American corporation who will create about 80 jobs in Roscommon <Col N="1376" /> town.  I look forward to the formal conclusion of the negotiations and on announcement by the Government on this.  It is not before time that we have received such a project for the town.  This area needs special attention.</P>
    <P>The IDA have difficulty in attracting mobile industry to Ireland, particularly to the peripheral regions, the west.</P>
    <P>A case should be made for a special allocation to be earmarked for the western region from the £6 billion, or whatever we receive from the Cohesion Fund, to assist in the creation of employment in the industrial sector.  It is much more costly to establish industry away from the eastern seaboard and the main export routes for our products.  In the circumstances a very strong case could be made for a permanent in-built transport subsidy for products produced in the peripheral regions in Europe.  If the Cohesion Fund, and the post-Maastricht arrangements are to mean anything, they should mean the elimination of the inbuilt disadvantages of establishing industry in the peripheral regions of Europe, and nowhere is more peripheral than the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome a recent call by the head of GPA for the establishment of an airbridge either from Horan International Airport at Knock or Shannon Airport to assist our manufacturers in the export of products to Europe and beyond.  That is a classic example of how Europe can assist.  It is worth investigating and I ask my colleague the Minister with responsibility for trade and marketing, Deputy O'Rourke, and An Bord Tráchtála to investigate the possibility of developing an airbridge between our region and the main markets of Europe of 340 million people.  The cost of transportation is a factor in industrial development.</P>
    <P>I do not favour a further amalgamation between An Bord Tráchtála and the IDA.  The amalgamation between Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council worked out very satisfactorily, but if we form one major conglomerate we will lose the focus which is there.  After working for more than two years with An Bord Tráchtála I know they performed <Col N="1377" /> extremely well in assisting our exporters to get their products to markets throughout the world, particularly to the lucrative European market.  We have had tremendous success in France and Germany. The regional markets programme which I helped prepare has worked very well and has great potential.  The additional support we received for the targeted marketing consultancy programme has also brought results.  All in all, the work in that area has a profound effect on our economy.</P>
    <P>In 1991 our total exports reached £15 billion, and I hope the Minister will be able to say that in 1992 that sum will be exceeded.  I note that the April trade figures are up but the difficulty for this or any Government is that the export figures are not translating into additional jobs. The Culliton report gave special consideration to this.  I expect the Government will implement many of the report's recommendations.  They have accepted the general thrust of the recommendations of that excellent report on industrial development.</P>
    <P>The work of An Bord Tráchtála is vital to the economy and, on the home front, it is important that they continue the work of the Irish Goods Council.  We could do so much by buying Irish products.  The &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is not totally in line with modern European thinking, nevertheless as a Member of the Oireachtas and a former Minister with responsibility for trade and marketing, I urge Irish people to buy Irish products.  About £1 billion worth of imported products could be substituted in the Irish economy.  Approximately 50,000 jobs could be created if Irish people bought Irish products.  I appeal in particular to the large supermarket chains operating in the economy to buy Irish products.  Some of these supermarkets do not display any great loyalty to home producers.  These supermarkets should be encouraged to buy Irish products where possible so that jobs can be created.  This would benefit those companies in the long run.</P>
    <P>I wish I had more time to speak about this issue.  I am glad the Patents Act, <Col N="1378" /> which I brought before the House, has been enacted and that the European Convention on Patents, which is vitally important, will be passed into law.  I am very anxious that the new Patents Office would be located in Roscommon town under the Government's decentralisation programme.  Counties Roscommon and Leitrim are the only counties on the western seaboard which have not benefited under the Government's decentralisation programme.  I call on the Government to decentralise a State Department to Roscommon town as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a few matters in the area of consumer affairs which may not have received the attention they deserve in the context of this Vote.  I was very surprised during the course of the debate on the Maastricht treaty to hear the Chairman of the Consumers Association of Ireland, Mr. John Corrigan, say that voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for the Treaty would not be good for consumers. I could not understand this remark because under the Treaty on European Union consumer protection will be enshrined in our Constitution for the first time ever.  I found it extraordinary that a representative of the Consumers Association of Ireland did not see the benefits for consumers of ratifying the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of consumer affairs has not been given the priority it deserves.  I welcome the Government's decision to allocate responsibility for consumer affairs to the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, and to give this issue much higher priority than it has received in the past.  I know that recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce has had to devote a great deal of his time to dealing with a large number of issues of an <Col N="1379" /> unsavoury nature which have not done this country much good.  My colleague, Deputy Peter Barry, elaborated on the effect of these issues on investment and business.  As he said, many businesses were attacked in the Finance Act because of their alleged failure to create employment opportunities, as sought by the Minister for Finance when he was Minister for Labour.  Private sector have been singled out for ruthless attention in the Finance Act by the Minister for Finance as a result of scandals in the public sector. I believe this will have a detrimental effect on the creation of jobs in 1992 and the years to come.</P>
    <P>In many cases it takes a long time for EC Directives to be put into effect here by way of legislation.  I hope this situation can be improved in the future.  The EC Directive on product safety which was passed some time ago gave us an ideal opportunity to correct the difficulties experienced by the Director of Consumer Affairs in removing unsafe products from the market.  I wish to give an example which will illustrate the lack of legislative teeth in the area of product safety.  The &ldquo;Toymaster&rdquo; magazine advertises the toys on the market and the shops in which they are sold.  This magazine recently carried an advertisement for a water gun called the Super Soaker.  The dangers of this lethal weapon were recently brought to my attention by parents whose children have purchased it.  These guns are able to project water over a distance of 30 feet.  If they are fired at close range they can have a significant impact, for example, serious damage could be caused to a person's eye.</P>
    <P>It has also been brought to my attention that this weapon is widely sold in the United States.  Iodine and ammonia bleach are used in some of these guns. Children have lost their lives as a result of being squirted by these substances. What is even more disturbing is the trend by urban criminal gangs to use this weapon in order to carry out warfare in many cities along the east coast of the United States.  In the light of this information, I find it very difficult to understand <Col N="1380" /> how the Director of Consumer Affairs still deems this product to be safe. I ask the Minister to refer this issue to Eolas or some testing authority in the United Kingdom so as to ascertain whether this product deemed to be safe under our product safety legislation.  I have to say that I would find it difficult to regard this as a safe toy.  In the light of experience in other countries, this product should be removed from the market immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the EC Directive on consumer credit.  We continually talk about the need to eliminate money-lending and bring financial institutions to heel over the irresponsible advertising and sales techniques they use to promote their financial packages.  There is no code of conduct or consistency in the way financial institutions deal with consumers. Many of the advertising techniques used by financial institutions leave much to be desired in terms of how they explain to people who are making very important decisions in respect of mortgages or life assurance policies the costs involved, the hidden costs and the processing costs. Consumers are never told how these costs can affect the cost of their policies.  I wish to register my protest at the lack of urgency shown by the Government in the past in the enactment of EC Directives on consumer affairs.  I hope they will not be as lethargic in this respect in the future as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in her reply to refer to the small claims court.  This court is being operated on a pilot basis at present. I should like the Minister to say whether an annual report will be published on the progress made by this court to date and whether there are any plans to extend it throughout the country.  I see a role for this court as citizens' information centres which could disseminate further information. In addition, regional offices of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs could be set up in various areas. These offices could be manned by the Customs and Excise officers who will be surplus to requirements after 1 January 1993.  I appeal to the Minister to consider <Col N="1381" /> this suggestion, thus enabling information to be disseminated locally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we were all pleased with the results of the recent Referendum on the Maastricht Treaty in view of its implications for our economy and the creation of jobs.  I shudder to think about the implications for this small island if we had rejected the Treaty.  In their document <i>The Jobs Economy</i> Fine Gael put forward a number of proposals on the creation of jobs.  This document was regarded by many media people as an interesting and refreshing approach to the jobs issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the mid-west region and the role played there by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company. While it is true to say that SFADCo have been used as a model of the success which can be achieved in this regard, I believe they may have lost their sense of direction. I am pleased that in recent times the Minister stated that he wants to see Shannon Free Airport Development Company focusing and redefining their involvement in certain areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to job creation for the area, I am a little concerned that we have fallen between two stools.  On the one hand, Shannon Free Airport Development Company are involved while on the other hand there is involvement by the Industrial Development Authority.  The IDA operate with an almost remote control approach in that they are based in Dublin and have no regional office in the mid-west region but yet they are supposed to be in liaison with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The success story of the area over the past year amounts to one overseas industry in the entire mid-west region, and fortunately that industry came to Newcastle West.  My constant reminders in the Chamber to the Minister for Industry and Commerce ensured that Newcastle West was considered in terms of the advance factory there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments have taken place along the estuary, particularly in relation to the trans-shipment project.  I sincerely hope that the Minister is not using this project <Col N="1382" /> as an election gimmick in order to placate three areas &mdash; Clare, North Kerry and Limerick.  He has directed his economic advisers to advance this theory, but we will have to wait to see what happens. We tend to be a little cynical when we hear of this idea because it has been mentioned many times in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>One matter of concern in the Shannon area relates to the Shannon stop-over.  I wonder whether the Minister was trying to placate local interests when he made his announcement in Killarney.  We may float the idea of trans-shipment but Shannon could lose its status.  The Minister's colleague on several occasions stated that she will make a decision shortly in relation to the Shannon stop-over.  I wonder whether there is a deliberate delay in making an announcement until such time as an election has taken place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the matter of time, there will be two or three minutes remaining before questions start.  Deputy Cullimore, who will be called at 12.35 p.m. will have ten minutes and if the House agrees we can give the extra three minutes to Deputy Finucane.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the indecision on the Shannon stop-over, there is concern in the area about jobs.  I notice recently that Aer Lingus have taken an optional lease of jets for long-haul journeys and I wonder whether there is something sinister in that.  I also notice in <i>The Irish Times</i> this week a certain buoyancy in the property section in that many hotels are mooted for the Dublin area to cater for American travellers.  I wonder whether there is a feeling within Dublin circles that a decision in this regard is inevitable.  It is almost like spinning a trout on a rod &mdash; maybe to a certain degree the Government are hoping that there will be a lack of motivation in the Shannon area if a decision is not made for some time.  Perhaps they feel that the drive, energy and commitment will dissipate but I do not believe that will happen because it is much too important <Col N="1383" /> an issue for the region.  In terms of the EC, people talk about regional development, subsidiarity and such &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; words.  Shannon is extremely important in this regard and I trust that the Government will recognise that when they eventually make a decision.</P>
      <P>In relation to Shannon Airport, I welcome the development of the aviation park, and the tremendous in-roads that have been made in terms of developments which have helped to create jobs in the area.  One matter which has developed over the last few years is the export of large quantities of softwood to Sweden.  Much of that softwood is being re-imported as pulpwood products for the printing industry.  It has been stated for some time that a pulp mill industry would be set up in this country.  Such an industry would be very important in the creation of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the Estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I compliment both Ministers on the work they are doing in this area, particularly Deputy O'Rourke, for the very progressive policy of highlighting the excellent products we have in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this late stage I would ask Fine Gael to reconsider their position of not participating in the jobs forum.  The Government must be complimented on the excellent idea of involving all political parties and the social partners in this forum which is working very well.  The committee have been divided into three groups dealing with employment strategies, anomalies in the social welfare system, incentives created in that area and the role of the European Community in solving the unemployment problem. All aspects for policy must be considered &mdash; industrial policy, tourism policy and agricultural policy.  We started with a clean sheet in the sense that we can examine and make recommendations on all aspects of economic and social policy relating to employment.  We are not confined to a narrow range of experts.  On <Col N="1384" /> the contrary, we are seeking to unite all sectors of the community in the drive to create more jobs.</P>
    <P>A number of anomalies in the system have come to light.  I have been involved in the area of unemployment and I have met people from the unemployment centres in my constituency.  These centres administer many social employment schemes that benefit young people and they play a very positive role in helping the community but they are crippled with PRSI payments and bank interest charges.  I hope that through the jobs forum we will be able to remove these anomalies and help create an incentive for the people who are doing an excellent job.</P>
    <P>Discussion and analysis must take place with communities to find out how the unemployment figures can be reduced.  Each community must be considered separately.  I would like to raise a query I have received from the Gorey Town Commissioners.  There is very high unemployment in Gorey town but the commissioners are not in a position to conduct a feasibility study to address the needs and skills that exist in the area.  I hope that central Government provide the necessary finance and the mechanism to help local communities look at individual needs and skills.  If we are unable to identify the skills and the needs in each locality we will be unable to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>We will also have to face up to the problems of rural society.  The role of conventional agriculture is contracting and there will be fewer farm jobs in the future.  We welcome the decision of Government to fund the operational programme for rural development, particularly the Leader programme.  These programmes should be carefully monitored to find out why they are not working in certain areas.  The existing support for agri-tourism, small industries and alternative farm enterprises, as well as training and education in these areas, will have to be considered.  The surest means of developing indigenous enterprises that will stand the test of time is by combining the innate talents and enterprise of these <Col N="1385" /> communities with local resources.  Small firms need to be freed up so that they can grow.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at a report published recently by the Small Firms Association which shows that in 1988-89 the Government outlined the Programme for Recovery.  The employment target was 37,000 new jobs between 1988 and 1990.  This was broken down into three areas &mdash; small businesses, a target of 10,000; Irish industry, a target of 10,500; and overseas industry, a target of 16,500.  It was interesting to note that small businesses achieved in the region of 8,654 jobs; Irish industry, 6,366; and overseas industry, 9,995.  In percentage terms small businesses achieved a delivery of 86.5 per cent.  That compares with Irish industry which achieved a delivery of 60.5 per cent and overseas industry which delivered 60.5 per cent.  It is interesting to note that in the IDA budget small firms have only received 13 per cent of that budget.</P>
    <P>With regard to costs per job created and sustained in 1983/1989, in Irish and overseas industry the cost was £19,830 and in the small business and enterprise development programme it was £9,773. There was an enormous difference between the cost of providing jobs in small firms and in the other sectors.  We in the jobs forum must pay careful attention to how we can rectify that position and provide finance for small firms to grow.  All Deputies are aware of successful companies in their constituencies which started out in a very small way. From every deputation, chamber of commerce and business meeting the same question is being asked &mdash; how does one get the seed capital to start an enterprise? There is a great deal of willingness to start up projects, but the difficulty is getting the start-up capital.  I hope the Government and the jobs forum can rectify this problem.</P>
    <P>The ultimate purpose of the jobs forum is to tackle the rising problems of unemployment. The first step must be to examine all aspects of economic policy.  The social partners have agreed to join the jobs forum.  As a member of the jobs <Col N="1386" /> forum, I will be delighted to hear the contributions from the trade unions, the farming community, the centres for the unemployed and the youth organisations. Up to now people involved in the centres for the unemployed have been marginalised and left out of the system.  The Government, through the jobs forum have recognised the role that they can play in helping to solve unemployment. From visiting unemployed centres in my constituency I know that many people now feel that they are part of the process of creating jobs.</P>
    <P>I hope Fine Gael will reconsider their position and join in the jobs forum the social partners and the people who have been marginalised.  I would ask Fine Gael to reconsider their position and join with us to try to solve this problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Rourke is the first Minister for Consumer Affairs that we have had and I congratulate her on starting quite well.  I hope activity will equal the talk we have had up to now.</P>
      <P>With regard to consumer affairs, will the Minister in her capacity as Minister for Consumer Affairs take up the need for a time share Bill to curb the practice of time share holidays in this State?  I understand that the European Parliament have made some directives on the matter, but Ireland at the moment is being used as a dumping ground.  Many of the time share holiday operators have had to vacate places like the UK and France and they are selling their wares in this country.  This is causing a lot of problems and we need legislation to curb it.  The hands of the Director of Consumer Affairs are tied and he is looking for legislation.  Members of the public are being duped by the fraudulent activity of many time share operators here.  Will the Minister look at it with a view to bringing in the necessary legislation to restrict this unsavoury practice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I referred to the Minister's reference to legal metrology and said that I could not find reference to it in the <i>State Directory.</i> There is a reference in the <i>State Directory</i>, but that does not take away from the point I made which I hope the Minister will address. Is there some significance in the amount? This is probably the first time it has ever been adverted to in the Minister's Estimate speech.  The amount of money is extremely small and the Minister has devoted a significant amount of his time to it.  What prompted this?</P>
      <P>It should be possible to get permanent offices for the Director of Consumer Affairs in major population centres.  I know the authorities periodically visit certain areas.  I hope the Minister can take on board this suggestion of establishing an office for the Director of Consumer Affairs in major areas of population, because there is no doubt that under European Community Union consumer affairs will prove to be of greater importance.  The fact that we will be subject to the consumers' interest is part of the Maastricht Treaty.  The future of Europe will be very much consumer based.  There should be a means by which a consumer can get his complaints or concerns to the authorities &mdash; whether it is the Government here or authorities in Brussels &mdash; at local level.  The Director of Consumer Affairs does a very good job with, I presume, a very small staff and an inadequate budget; but if he is to be truly effective he should be visible in as many locations as possible.</P>

      <P>Lest it be misunderstood, I repeat that my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is unable to be here because of his primary responsibility to the Cabinet.  There was a Cabinet meeting at 11 a.m. and that was accepted by all.  However, one of the Opposition Deputies was not here when the Minister's apology was made, so I repeat it. Indeed, Deputy O'Malley is always very assiduous about his duties to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed <Col N="1388" /> to the debate on the important Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. I will deal with the queries in the order they arose and then I will reply to queries from across the floor. Deputy Barry asked how and when the proposals in the Culliton report will be implemented.  In his speech Deputy O'Malley said that he expected the Government to make their decision shortly on the task force proposals.  As I understand it, this will happen in the very near future.  Many other Deputies, including Deputy Ferris, asked for a Government commitment to implement the task force proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked also if the task force proposals will be published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the task force report will first have to be scrutinised by Government and a decision on its publication will then be made.  Obviously the proposals will have to be scrutinised by the Government as this was the decision taken when the task force was set up and I expect that it may then be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Publication of the task force proposals would allow us to see what is happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Transparency will certainly be the prime objective.  Indeed, it has been their <i>modus operandi</i> to date and I am sure the task force will continue with their policy of transparency.</P>
      <P>I remember being present in the House when Deputy Barry asked why tourism was being excluded from the terms of reference of the Culliton Industrial Policy Review Group &mdash; indeed I remember thinking at the time that this was odd. However, a task force on tourism was established and we await their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The jobs forum was also raised. Labour, The Democratic Left and the Government parties are working together on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment and Deputies on this side of the House have asked the Fine Gael Party to reconsider their position. <Col N="1389" /> Again, let me put it to them that we would like to see them participate in this committee.</P>
    <P>I note with interest Deputy Barry's suggestion that we should have one agency to deal with marketing and another to deal with investment as he did not see the reason for breaking up the IDA into two separate agencies, one to deal with home industries and the other to deal with overseas matters.  I have a certain sympathy with the Deputy in that regard.  Deputy Barry then went on to condemn the budget, but I think it was a very well thought out strategy and it is part of the evolving process of tax reform by cutting what were heretofore subsidies to certain sectors.  Of course that is painful, but I totally reject the assertion that it is anti-business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry asserted that Telecom Éireann were abusing their premier position and he queried whether they would be covered by the Competition Act.  I had this matter checked out by my officials and to date the Minister has not made any request to the Competition Authority under section 11 or 14 of the Act.  He made one reference to the authority in relation to a merger application and the Deputy will remember that this concerned the newspapers.  The Competition Act applies to all engaged in economic gain through the provision of the goods and services.  Deputy Barry also expressed his concern about Telecom Éireann's potentially dominant position in the security industry.  As I understood it, the Department have not received any allegations or complaints from any person in that regard.  I realise that Deputy Barry made his complaint in good faith so we would be interested in hearing the allegation made to him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> Deputy Barry said he was rather puzzled at the length of time which the Minister spent on legal metrology, but he then went on to say that he found it interesting and I am glad of that.  This is particularly relevant in the consumer area.  It is quite amazing that the debate focused on so many matters of consumer interest.  That is one of the reasons that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, focused on that area. It is a major part of the Department's activities and has consequences for employment.  Measurement is fundamental to the operation of the markeplace &mdash; indeed as fundamental as the currency.  The legal metrology section of the Department oversee the implementation of the EC Directive on units of measurement.  The legal metrology section have a very important role in ensuring consumers' rights are not infringed.  Our office are issuing a very strong press release on EC Directive 86/617 on the units of measurement.  As Deputies know, we have made progress in converting to the metric system.</P>

      <P>Both the Labour Party and The Democratic Left Party spokespersons dwelt extensively on the need for a jobs forum and what they expected from the Culliton report.  If this appears to be very truncated, it is that I wish to deal with consumer affairs and in particular to respond to Deputy Flanagan, who raised the need for legislation on time share properties. Time share is going to be discussed next Monday at the meeting of Consumer Council Ministers in Luxembourg.  This topic is on the formal agenda for discussion and we are at the stage of seeking advice on this matter.  I share the Deputy's concern.  Time share is becoming a rampant problem as people are gullible and are falling for the salesman's pitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same vein Deputy Barry spoke about the need for consumer affairs offices around the country.  I wish to echo this praise of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  However, there is a greater need for awareness about this service and this will have to come about.  We cannot on the one hand talk about the need for consumer representation and information and on the other do nothing about it.  Deputy Hogan, my very worthy adversary on consumer affairs, brought a particular product, a water pistol, to our attention.  He felt that this was very <Col N="1392" /> dangerous and he asked that it be subject to the General Product Safety Directive. As I understand this will also be discussed at next Mondays's meeting in Luxembourg, I now undertake on the floor of the House to bring up this specific matter at that meeting and discuss it fully with my fellow Ministers.  Deputy Hogan said the gun has been examined and it has been suggested that it is not dangerous but I do not take that at face value and I believe the matter warrants further examination.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £620,144,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1992, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity, my first as <Col N="1393" /> Minister for the Environment, to debate the areas of responsibility embraced by the 1992 Environment Estimate.</P>
    <P>Because of the limited time available, and the wide range of services covered by the Estimate, I can only refer to a limited selection of the major areas within my Department's remit.  However, I will try as far as possible to deal with points raised by Deputies at the end of the debate.  The House has had other opportunities, of course, over the past few months to discuss major areas of my Department's responsibilities, in processing the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991; the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992; the Housing Bill, 1992; the Roads Bill, 1991; and the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Bill.  In addition, there has been a special debate in preparation for the UNCED conference and we can look forward to debates on the Electoral Bill, 1991 which is at present being discussed in the Seanad, and the Road Traffic Bill, on which drafting is well advanced.</P>
    <P>The net estimate before the House is just over £620 million, an increase of 4 per cent over last year.  The most significant increase is in the provision for national road improvement which is up by £27.48 million on 1991.</P>
    <P>I would, of course, prefer if the provisions for the many other worthwhile services in the Estimate were higher but we have to remember that the Estimates as a whole were determined against an economic backdrop which required all public expenditure to be fundamentally examined and all possible economies to be made, without endangering the delivery of essential services.  The fact that we cannot look to ever-increasing expenditure on State services presents a challenge to all of us.  We must take a fresh look at established practices and devise new ways of providing improved services more effectively and at minimum cost. This responsibility must be shared by the local authorities, who provide many of the services which are funded from the Environment Estimate, and I look forward <Col N="1394" /> to a fruitful partnership with them in working towards this objective.</P>
    <P>The traditional format of the Estimate has been changed this year by classifying the expenditue involved on a programme basis, as far as possible.  This facilitates analysis of the sectoral implications of the Estimate rather than merely focusing either on the overall figures or on individual services or activities.</P>
    <P>My Department's annual review of the construction industry should be completed and published shortly but I can say, even at this stage, that the signs are good.</P>
    <P>Overall, the industry has been performing reasonably well in recent years, in contrast to the decline which marked much of the eighties.  Output rose by over 25 per cent in 1989 and 1990.  A levelling off in activity was apparent during 1991, but there were signs of an emerging recovery in the housing sector in the late months of the year.</P>
    <P>The indicators for the industry this year are positive.  The relevant Public Capital Programme allcations have been increased by over 10 per cent compared to the 1991 outturn and this should help to sustain strong performance in areas such as energy, transport, housing, education and health.  In the light of this increase, I am confident that activity generally will show an increase on the 1991 level.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal programme is one of the most visible achievements of the Government over the last few years.  This has generated some £721 million worth of private sector development between projects completed, in progress or in planning.  When the Custom House Docks development in Dublin is included, the total comes to more than £1.1 billion.</P>
    <P>This high level of investment has generated construction jobs and, most importantly, a significant number of long term jobs.  It is clear that, without the incentives offered under the urban renewal programme, most of the projects concerned would not have gone ahead.</P>
    <P>This year's Finance Act makes provision for a final one-year extension of <Col N="1395" /> these incentives to 31 May 1994 for projects already underway on 31 May 1993 in designated areas.  In addition, the time limit applying to the tax incentives in the Custom House Docks Area is extended by four years from 25 January 1993. These extensions will allow sufficient time for projects in the designated areas at the pre-construction stage, currently valued at about £380 million, to be undertaken, and will facilitate completion of the Custom House Docks development.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on roads-related services accounts for almost 44 per cent of the gross estimate.  The need for major investment in our road network is unquestionable, as is the link between that investment and economic development. My Department estimated in 1987-88 that investment of £9 billion was necessary, of which £3 billion related to national roads.  Fortunately, we have been able, with EC assistance, to adopt an integrated five-year investment programme to meet that need.  And the positive result from the recent referendum means that we can face into the negotiations for the period after 1993 with confidence that the present programme can be continued and, indeed, expanded through increased Structural Funds assistance and support from the new Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that the investment programme involving national primary roads projects is substantially on target.  All but one of the 23 projects due to commence in the period 1989 to 1991 are now under way.  Seventeen projects, with a combined cost of some £204 million, were completed during the same period, and at the end of last year, construction was under way on 14 major projects with a combined cost of £305 million.</P>
    <P>The commitment given in the 1989 budget that £150 million would be provided over three years in discretionary grants to county councils for regional and county roads was more than fulfilled.  In fact, total gains over the three years 1989-91 amounted to £182.47 million and I am maintaining the momentum this year <Col N="1396" /> with a continued high level of investment. I want to emphasise, however, that the State grants for non-national roads are intended to supplement, and not to replace, the expenditure on non-national roads financed by the local authorities from their own resources.  It is the local authorities who have always had primary responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of these non-national roads and I look to them to sustain their own financial commitment to this essential service and to ensure that the overall resources available are used efficiently.</P>
    <P>The past year has seen significant changes in the social housing area with the implementation of a wide range of new measures to secure decent housing for low income groups on the basis set out in the &ldquo;Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992, currently before the House, provides the legislative framework for many of the policy measures announced in the plan.</P>
    <P>The overall capital provision for housing, including both Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, will be some £158 million in 1992, an increase of nearly 30 per cent on the 1991 outturn.  This is primarily due to the expected increase in the take-up of the various new schemes, particularly the shared ownership scheme, for which a provision of £35 million has been made in 1992.</P>
    <P>Taking into account all the new measures to provide social housing which were announced in the plan, as well as the traditional local authority housing programme and new lettings arising from vacancies, we could cater for up to 7,000 households in 1992 if local authorities make full use of the various measures and resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The total 1992 capital provision for the local authority and voluntary housing programme is over £78 million, up 3 per cent on 1991.  This includes £41.5 million for the completion or acquisition by local authorities of about 1,500 dwellings this year, compared to 1,180 in 1991.  A further 1,000 new starts have been authorised and these, when added to the starts authorised but not actually proceeded <Col N="1397" /> with in previous years, should enable local authorities to commence up to 1,500 new houses in 1992.</P>
    <P>The 1991 outturn figures on the local authority housing programme were disappointing, given the pressure on the local authority waiting lists.  Fewer local authority dwellings were started last year than had been authorised and there were fewer completions than expected.  I have therefore asked local authorities to ensure that the numbers of new starts and completions for which resources have been allocated this year are achieved in full.</P>
    <P>In order to assist in this respect, my Department have reviewed the procedures relating to the approval and control of the local authority housing construction programme and I will be putting new streamlined procedures in place shortly.  These will reduce submissions to the Department to the minimum, consistent only with ensuring that value for money is achieved and that overall expenditure remains within the resources allocated.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £11 million has been made in 1992 for the capital assistance scheme for voluntary housing.  This will provide some 550 units of accommodation, bringing the total provided since the scheme began in 1984 to over 2,600 units.  Furthermore, £500,000 is again being made available from national lottery funds to provide communal facilities in new or existing voluntary housing projects.</P>
    <P>The new voluntary housing rental subsidy scheme, aimed at the provision of accommodation for families, is now taking off.  One project comprising nine dwellings is already completed, three projects are in progress and some 20 more are at various stages of planning. In all, about 400 dwellings are involved. I have made a capital provision of £5 million for the scheme this year.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Act, 1991, placed local authorities in a new legislative framework, allowing them greater scope and discretion to undertake activities which they consider to be of benefit to their local communities.  I am firmly <Col N="1398" /> committed to the continuation of a programme for the improvement of our local government system.  This will involve, among other things, the removal of various statutory controls, and further measures to modernise outdated legal provisions.  The special ministerial committee which is examining the complex matter of sub-county structures &mdash; on which the independent advisory expert committee failed to agree &mdash; and the related matter of the devolution of functions will complete their work well before the end of the year, so that whatever legislation is required can be brought forward early in 1993.</P>
    <P>The report which I recently received from the London-based Institute for Fiscal Studies &mdash; IFS &mdash; on rate support grant distribution in Ireland follows directly from the work of the advisory expert committee on local government reform &mdash; the Barrington Committee &mdash; which arranged for a two-phase study on the grant distribution process.  A report on Phase 1 of the IFS study was published last year as a supplement to the report of the Barrington Committee.</P>
    <P>The Phase II report outlines equalisation models, based on various assumptions, which make it possible to compare the effects of a range of possible indicators for the distribution of the rate support grant by reference to needs and resources.  I have sent the local report to local authorities for their consideration of the IFS methodology for assessing needs, and their findings generally, and I will await their views before reaching any conclusions on the report.  I had asked for these views to be submitted by the end of July, but I am extending this date to the end of September in response to a request by the City and County Managers' Association.  Needless to say, all of the implications will have to be very carefully considered before we can decide on the feasibility, or the desirability, of adopting one or other of the IFS options or, indeed, any other option of that kind.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development &mdash; UNCED &mdash; which took place in Rio de <Col N="1399" /> Janeiro, from 3 to 12 June, was the most comprehensive international effort ever mobilised in favour of the environment. UNCED was inspired by the influential report in 1987 of the World Commission on Environment and Development &mdash; the Brundtland Report &mdash; which advocated the concept of &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo;, that is, development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</P>
    <P>The UNCED conference has made a major impact on public consciousness and has raised the status of environment and development issues on national and international agendas.  The Earth Summit was attended by some 170 countries, with well over 100 of them being represented by Heads of State or Government.</P>
    <P>Ireland participated fully in the UNCED process.  We were represented at all of the preparatory conferences and I myself attended the final conference in New York last March.  In addition, we were privileged, last January, to host the International Conference on Water and the Environment in Dublin which was mandated to contribute to the UNCED preparations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who attended the Summit segment of the UNCED Conference, has already made a full statement in the House on the outcome and I dealt with other aspects in replying to Questions earlier this week.  At this stage, therefore, I merely wish to reiterate that, in so far as national environmental policy is concerned, the implications on UNCED will be addressed through the Environment Action Programme, the next review of which should be completed in the Autumn.</P>
    <P>Work on the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency is now under way.  One of the first tasks will be the selection and appointment of the director general and other directors.  It is my intention that the process leading to these appointments will be initiated soon so that the agency can start work on the very important functions assigned to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> The provision of £710,000 in the Estimate for the agency and environmental research reflects the fact that it will be some time later in the year before the agency becomes operational.  This sum is, of course, exclusive of whatever funds will be transferred to the agency as a result of the assignment or transfer of staff from other bodies for whom budgetary provision has been made separately.</P>
    <P>The public water supply and sanitary services programme for which £72.5 million is provided this year plays a significant role in supporting the various sectors of our economy, as well as meeting the needs of local authorities.  It is a programme and a service that is often taken for granted.  But we have to remember that water is not a free good, nor is it in unlimited supply.  All of us must become more conscious of the cost involved in supplying large quantities of clean water for all our daily needs, and adjust our actions accordingly.  The capital cost of new schemes, which is met by the Exchequer, is quite considerable and we must remember that the operation and maintenance of water and sewerage schemes is also an expensive process &mdash; costing local authorities some £90 million a year.</P>
    <P>Significant progress was made last year with the completion of 53 schemes valued at £51.3 million.  In addition, tenders valued at £74 million were approved, providing the basis for the 1992 work programme.</P>
    <P>While pressure of time precludes a full survey, my remarks today demonstrate that the functions of the Department of the Environment and of local authorities cover a broad range of activities which impinge on our daily lives.  The Estimate before the House will enable the many services involved to be continued and enhanced this year, in spite of the difficult budgetary circumstances, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no bones about the fact that I consider the present Minister for the Environment to be one of the most bland, laid back, unconcerned Ministers for the Environment we have <Col N="1401" /> had for a long time.  We have just heard one of the most smug speeches on the Environment Estimate that has come before this House for many years.  The Minister did not refer once to the fact that there are still in excess of 20,000 dwellings in the State, many within a half mile walking distance of his office, without bathrooms.  There is no reference to any plan to ensure that those basic facilities, indoor toilets, bathrooms and running water, are provided in those dwellings.  There is no reference in his smug speech to the disgraceful condition of many flat complexes within a few minutes walk of his plush offices.</P>
      <P>There is no mention in the Minister's speech of the housing crisis that now besets this country where we actually have paid servants of health boards going out canvassing landlords to please allow clients to come into one of their flats and promising to jack up the housing subsidy because of the housing crisis.  There is no reference in his speech to the fact that in this city of Dublin, and, I am sure, other cities and towns throughout the country, there are couples with children sleeping in cars for weeks on end.  There is no reference in his speech to the awful pressures being applied to local authority staff in housing departments every day.  There is no expression of concern for those on the waiting lists.  He mentioned his disappointment at the low number of starts in 1991 and the possibility of a small increase in housing starts in 1992.  The figures he quotes are only a fraction of the housing needs and even a smaller fraction of the housing completions in the five-year period before Fianna Fáil returned to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thinks he can be smug with the House but I wish to raise a most profound issue concerning the attitude of his Department to parliamentary questions. The Minister thinks that by curtailing debates, for instance today's debate on the Environment Estimate and next week's guillotine on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, he will get out of being accountable to the House.  I give notice that from today I shall refer to the Committee on Procedure <Col N="1402" /> and Privileges the manner in which questions are being dealt with by the Department of the Environment.  I have gone to the Clerk of the Dáil and shown him examples of Questions in reply to which the Department of the environment have either told lies to the House or have used the ruse of having questions ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>In respect of certain matters the Department have said that the responsibility lies with local authorities but every member of a local authority knows that when an approach is made to the local authority the response is that the permission of the Department is needed. The Department constantly use the ruse of having questions ruled out of order on the basis that they are repeats.  For example, I tabled a general question about lottery grants in 1992 and asked whether the Government were living up to their commitments as spelt out in the Revised Programme of Government in October, when it was solemnly agreed by the parties in Government that lottery grants &mdash; which, incidentally, the Minister referred to only in passing &mdash; were to be decided by the local authorities. The Government have got out from under that solemn commitment by using the ploy of having no new lottery grants for local authorities this year and merely continuing grants that were selected by Fianna Fáil last year.  By using all kinds of ploys the Minister refuses to come into the House to answer questions.  My question on lottery grants generally for 1991 was ruled out of order after pressure was put on by the Department of the Environment on the basis of a question asked by Deputy Spring about County Westmeath lottery grants.</P>
    <P>I put it to you, Sir, that that is disreputable behaviour by the Minister and his Department, who are trying to get out of their accountability to the House. I have here a file of information to use as an example.  I asked the Minister whether he was aware of the Greenhouse Action Programme in the United Kingdom.  His Department sought to have and succeeded in having that question ruled out of order as a repeat because of a question <Col N="1403" /> that had been asked earlier of the Minister of State, although neither that question nor the reply to it at any time referred to the United Kingdom Greenhouse Action Programme.</P>
    <P>My party and I take a most serious view of the behaviour of the Department of the Environment.  We have come to the conclusion that that Department are by far the worst when it comes to replying to parliamentary questions.  I intend to ask that senior officials of the Department be called before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to account for the advice they are giving to their Minister and the pressure they are putting on the General Office of this House in relation to questions.  The revelations now coming before the Beef Tribunal concerning the behaviour of officials in other Departments should serve as a warning that officials of the State cannot subvert the authority or rights of this House to hold them and their Minister to account.  I ask the Minister himself to take an interest in the record of his Department in replying to questions, in using ruses to have questions ruled out of order, and in giving one-line replies. In reply to a question yesterday in which I asked about the Greenhouse Action Programme, the Minister said, &ldquo;I refer to the reply to Question No. 77 of 25 March 1992.&rdquo;  Question No. 77 of 25 March does not even refer to the Greenhouse Action Programme.  As I have said, I shall refer these matters to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as examples of the misbehaviour of the Department of the Environment, and I am intent on making sure that the Department are accountable to the House and that such misbehaviour will discontinue forthwith.</P>
    <P>I should like to share the remaining short time available to me with Deputy Bernard Allen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to some <Col N="1404" /> points raised in the Minister's speech.  He claimed one &mdash; and only one, I think &mdash; achievement for the Government.  That achievement was urban renewal.  The Minister has a brass neck.  The urban renewal programme was commenced under the urban renewal legislation of 1986 by the Fine Gael Labour Coalition Government.  It was under that legislation that the designated areas and incentives were introduced.  However, the Minister's speech claims as an achievement of the Government all of the great urban renewal that is going on. Indeed, I very much welcome that urban renewal.  For a Minister who has been in office for three or four months to claim the kudos for that urban renewal for himself or for any of his Fianna Fáil predecessors is an effrontery.  The urban renewal programme was a very well thought out and inspired move of the former Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  The Minister's speech states:</P>
      <P>The Urban Renewal Programme is one of the most visible achievements of the Government over the last few years.</P>
      <P>The Minister is claiming credit for something that was conceived and started before his Government came to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my personal belief that much more needs to be done in relation to urban renewal.  For instance, I do not believe that the programme will have the desired results if the urban renewal programme and the incentives are put in place and left there and we just hope that <i>ad hoc</i> individual projects will develop our cities in a graceful and co-ordinate way.  I point to the example of the Dublin City Quays from Heuston Station to the East Link.  The Custom House itself is a very beautiful building and has been refurbished at enormous public expense, quite rightly so.  The Four Courts building further up the quays, has now been refurbished. Apart from those two buildings, the quays are a disgrace to this city.  There has been some urban renewal along the quays but it has been done in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  It is all unmatching, unco-ordinated and uninspired.  The time has come <Col N="1405" /> to have an overall design plan for major routes such as the city quays.  We ought to have a clear view of the way the quays should look 20 years from now.  That would inevitably mean some grand objectives in the French style.  For instance, we would need to consider the construction of one, two or three major public buildings on the quays in the next 20 to 25 years.  We should plan to set off the quays rather than just wait for applications for a garage, office block, shopping complex and so on &mdash; some of which developments would be in red brick; some of which would be five, six or seven storeys high; some of which would be set back 20 feet and some of which would be set back 40 feet.  <i>Ad hoc</i> developments have no real co-ordinated plan or vision.</P>
    <P>Far from claiming credit for the urban renewal programme, the Minister should recognise that while there has been success in the urban renewal initiative of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, more needs to be done and we cannot just sit back and hope that all will be right and that our cities will develop in a grand, co-ordinated and elegant appearance.  They will not develop in that way.  Apart from the need for elegance and grand objectives, as I have mentioned, the reality is that despite many of the incentives there are still many gaping sites of dereliction in our cities.  That is very evident when one walks a few hundred yards north, south, east or west of the Custom House.  If you travel through Mountjoy Square, Seán McDermott Street, Cumberland Street, along the diner Street, Macken Street, along the quays to Smithfield or down to Sheriff Street, it is obvious that there is terrible dereliction and there is no plan or dynamism to bring this urban blight to an end. The smugness of the Minister's speech in relation to urban renewal is contemptible, bearing in mind that he and his Government had very little to do with it and obviously he does not have any new ideas of his own.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that his speech had to be curtailed, the same applies to mine.  This is because the <Col N="1406" /> Government did not make adequate provision for proper debates in this House on Estimates.  More than a full day should be devoted to teasing out, line by line, the Estimates of Departments of State. However, we are yet again nodding through the Estimate of a Department which, by any standards, needs a great deal of improvement and to be made made much more accountable to the elected representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>An Estimate of £620 million is being discussed and I have only eight minutes in which to speak on it.  It is a commentary on the way we do business in this House.  The Government should introduce real Dáil reform where we can have at least one day to go through these Estimates and even set up committees to deal with them.  Until that is done we will have a repeat of this charade.</P>
      <P>The Minister's smugness in dealing with this Estimate is unbelieveable.  I am sure at this stage he believes his own propaganda.  His speech was totally devoid of reality.  For example, he said he was disappointed that local authorities had not carried out their responsibilities or utilised their resources in the area of housing.  If the Minister was in touch with reality he should know that local authorities throughout the country have programmes for house construction which they cannot implement, because the Minister is squeezing them dry for finance.  In Cork city alone over 2,000 people are on the housing list.  It is contemptible to hear the Minister say that local authorities have failed to carry out their responsibilities.  The Minister has failed in his responsibility to give money to local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleague said that he would not build any more of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true, the Minister is misrepresenting the position.  The public relations companies are propping up the Government but when they are left on their own they cannot deliver.  The Minister's speech was a public relations <Col N="1407" /> exercise, everything in the garden is rosy. However, the reality is that people are being exploited throughout our towns and cities because of inadequate housing. As I said, in Cork city there are over 2,000 people on the housing list but the most we can build this year is 40 houses; properties worth millions of pounds are empty because we cannot maintain the buildings.  It is a scandal.</P>
      <P>In relation to urban renewal, it is indicative of the Minister's attitude that he dealt with the Custom House Docks site in Dublin.  Many other cities and towns need urban renewal and are crying out for money to implement urban renewal programmes.  There are local plans for parts of cities which cannot be implemented because of lack of finance. The Minister should concentrate on cities throughout the country which are falling into disrepair and which are totally blighted by urban decay.  Local authorities &mdash; including my own &mdash; have plans which they could implement tomorrow if the money was available.  We do not even have money for public lights, if a residents' group want a light erected on the corner of a laneway in a city it cannot be provided because of lack of funds.  Local authorities cannot even collect cut grass in our estates and parks throughout the country, the grass is left to blow on to the roadway, causing further litter.  We do not have the finance, manpower or equipment to deal with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is codswallop for the Minister to speak in glowing terms about urban renewal; it is all shadow and no substance. We should have a real programme of urban renewal where living conditions are improved and people's spirits uplifted because the downward spiral of unemployment and urban decay is demoralising.  It makes areas of high unemployment unattractive for industrial investment.  We all know that if there is industrial investment it will create good conditions, which is the case in modern parts of the country.  However, the older parts of our cities do not have a hope of attracting industry and employment to <Col N="1408" /> their areas because they are run down and unattractive.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I tabled a question to the Minister's Department regarding repossessions and evictions, which are a growing problem because of the economic climate.  I received a reply that the question had been disallowed because the Minister did not have responsibility in the matter.  Who has responsibility for evictions and repossessions which cause misery and heartbreak to many families struck down by illness and unemployment and who cannot fulfil their responsibilities to the local authorities who have advanced loans?  Nobody seems to have responsibility in this regard.  Will we ignore people who have been trampled on by the pressures of unemployment and everyday living?  Can we give them any hope?  The Minister has a responsibility to carry out a national survey on the level of repossessions and evictions by local authorities and the financial institutions.  There is a problem in that regard which the Minister should address.  It is disgraceful to receive a reply from the Minister's Department saying that he does not have any responsibility in the matter, that it is one for the local authorities.  It is not a matter for the local authorities; they can carry out their responsibilities only if they are funded.  I urge the Minister to carry out a survey and to take the necessary steps to give people dignity when they face problems like this.  We need a departmental plan to allow people to escape from the trauma of eviction and repossession in cases where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment or sickness.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of national lottery funding.  The generosity of our people and their weakness for a gamble are being exploited in a base manner by the Government because part of the national lottery funding is being used as a political slush fund by the Government.  All the pious platitudes contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have been cast aside in the interests of political patronage. Local authorities were promised control over the distribution of lottery <Col N="1409" /> funds but that has not been the case.  The Minister promised that this year local authorities would be given the right to decide and allocate moneys from the national lottery.  That has not happened. The sporting and community organisations throughout the cities and towns do not know where they stand.  Their development plans have been stalled because they do not know where they are going.  Where has the money gone?  It is being siphoned off to other areas.  The Minister has a responsibility to tell those people who spend between £1 and £5 each week on national lottery tickets where the money is going, because it is not being allocated to the local authorities to support the community-based organisations that are dependent upon it.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that I am disappointed in relation to the information contained in the Minister's speech regarding the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is obvious that this is yet another example of where legislation will not be implemented.  Having regard to the amount of money that has been allocated for the agency this year the indications for next year and for the next two to three years are that agency will be a lame duck with the result that local authorities and other groups around the country will be unable to meet their responsibilities under the Air Pollution Act and other legislation relating to environmental protection. I therefore ask the Minister to state clearly who is responsible for this important task of environmental protection. We have a lame duck agency who are under-funded and, who, by the looks of things, will have a long gestation period.  At the same time the local authorities are being starved of funds to carry out work that needs to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Environment are a big spending Department.  Indeed, the sum involved is mind boggling.  It would be fair to say also that the Department of the Environment touch the lives of practically every person in this country.  As a result, we must analyse and scrutinise carefully this Estimate <Col N="1410" /> in relation to the effect that they have on our citizens.</P>
      <P>The recent summit at Rio de Janeiro emphasised the importance of the environment. Those interest groups who do not realise the gravity of their action, who are deliberately careless and ignore the danger posed to the environment in their quest for profit and gain pose a danger and a threat.  These &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; merchants who have no vision must be condemned given that they pose a threat to all our futures, in particular to those of our children.</P>
      <P>This country is reputed to have a good, clean environment.  We must therefore jealously guard and promote that reputation worldwide.  However, there is room for co-operation with industry in the pursuit of policies that would benefit everyone.  Indeed, I must compliment all those industries which are complying with the regulations which have been laid down and, in particular, those industries which have indicated their willingness to co-operate with the local authorities and Government Departments in creating much needed jobs while preserving our clean environment.  It is also necessary to heighten awareness among young students of the value of the environment to this country.</P>
      <P>I should say to the Minister that there are many environmentalists who at great cost to themselves have shown both public representatives and Government Departments that they have a strong desire to preserve the environment as one of our most valuable assets.  I am referring in particular to people such as Matt Murphy who is doing great work in this area, with particular reference to the marine sector and landfill sites.  He has brought together people with immense knowledge to impart this knowledge to the community.  These people must be complimented as they are doing an excellent job for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be churlish of me to condemn the Estimate and the Minister for not making any progress.  Some progress has been made but there is room for much more.  I should point out that the local authorities have major difficulties.  The <Col N="1411" /> time is opportune to examine these problems and to look to the Minister for action to resolve them.  As a member of Cork Corporation &mdash; Deputy Allen has already referred to some of the problems facing them &mdash; I wish to highlight the fact that they have been starved of resources and that this is a major problem for local communities.</P>
    <P>Emphasis is no longer placed on local government as we know it.  I believe that the local authorities could act as job creation agencies but, unfortunately, this is not the case.  These authorities would be able to identify quite easily those areas where jobs could be created if they were provided with the resources to do so.  Not alone are they being starved of finance but they are being starved of manpower also.</P>
    <P>Each year as the Estimates are being prepared the local authorities face a crisis.  Indeed, it has now become an annual event and invariably those authorities who work diligently throughout the year to improve their town or city are left with a shortfall at the end of the year when that horrible phrase &ldquo;service charges&rdquo; surfaces again and again.  There has been a strong reaction from people in towns and cities outside Dublin to the issue of service charges.  They consider it to be double taxation and it is hard to blame them because this is what it amounts to.  While those living in Dublin get away scot free, the rest of the country have to pay and this has led to divisions among communities.  The Department of the Environment dictate the quality of life that citizens enjoy.  Unfortunately, for many the quality of life has deteriorated rapidly during the past few years.</P>
    <P>The number of staff in our local authorities has been reduced.  For instance, since 1987 the workforce in Cork Corporation has been reduced by 500.  Not only has this led to a loss of services but also to a reduction in the amount of finance in circulation within the city. This reduction in the labour force has affected each section of Cork Corporation. <Col N="1412" /> Their parks are no longer attractive despite the fact that the workers who remain are doing their level best to keep them attractive.  For example, there are large properties and tracts of land owned by Cork Corporation left to become derelict or unkempt with grass growing over them and so on.</P>
    <P>If we are endeavouring to present a city attractive to industrialists to set up there and create jobs then it is very serious that we are on a care and maintenance basis, which is the wording of the city engineer.  A care and maintenance basis means that it is a mothball ship or a redundant factory, which is left to stand idle, merely switching on the lights in the morning and switching them off in the evening.  Cork city is now being classified as a care and maintenance base city, which is not good enough.  If we are serious about tackling the problem of the huge numbers of unemployed people in Cork, then the city must be made attractive to industrialists who may want to come and establish factories there, but also attractive and amenable to people who want to live there.</P>
    <P>Now that the Central Statistics Office is being transferred to Cork I sincerely hope we will receive some funding to make that area of Cork city attractive also.  It is important, in any area encountering problems such as massive unemployment, half or totally empty industrial estates, that, when people are brought there by the IDA or any other job agency, they can present that city, town or wherever as a place to which people would like to come and spend their working lives.  That is not happening because of lack of funds, which is a false economy.</P>
    <P>There has been reference already to public lighting in our cities and towns nationwide.  In most cases these are antiquated lighting systems which cannot be replaced by local authorities by more modern-type public lighting systems which would be a saving in the long run since their maintenance costs would be reduced.  At present the public lighting bill in Cork alone amounts to £650,000 annually, and that in respect of anti- <Col N="1413" /> quated lighting which no longer meets citizens' needs.</P>
    <P>Our library services have been downgraded because of cut backs on manpower, with no renewal of books and so on.  It is most important that every city have an adequate public library service. In addition, there has been a minimal increase in charges which again hits many unemployed persons availing of those services since they cannot meet them.  In the case of swimming pools, increased costs means that fewer people use them, again mostly caused by the high levels of unemployment.</P>
    <P>While it would be churlish of me to totally reject the Minister's introductory remarks, I might deal with a couple of points he made.  For example, he said there would be a streamlining of his Department leading to quicker approval of housing schemes.  That is indeed to be welcomed because the position that has obtained to date was ridiculous.  For example, we are told it took two years from the date a local authority housing application was submitted to the Department to the time an occupant could be installed, a ridiculous time lapse.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, time did not allow my participation in the debate on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992. However, in the few minutes remaining I should like to speak about this most important local authority housing problem. For example, last month's figures showed there were over 2,000 applicants for local authority housing on Cork Corporation housing list, a horrendous figure by any standards.  The local authority housebuilding programme is practically nil.  I have the relevant figures before me which are frightening.  For example, in Cork in 1987 there were 193 local authority houses built; in 1988, 121; in 1989, one house only; in 1990, 14; there are presumed to have been 56 built in 1991 and there are some starts, with the prediction of about 40 to be built this year if I am not mistaken.</P>
    <P>I have served on the housing committee of Cork Corporation since 1979, have seen those figures increase month by month, year by year and witnessed the <Col N="1414" /> misery it has caused many families.  The present position in Cork is reflected nationwide, in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Dublin.  Private landlords have seen this as a lucrative market and have exploited others' misery, increasing rents out of all proportion to the standard or value of the property they rent.  The only place in respect of which I can quote figures is Cork.  For example, two years ago the Southern Health Board paid £200,000 in rent and mortgage subsidies in the north Lee area, comprising half of the Southern Health Board area.  That figure has now risen astronomically to £750,000, and that in just over two years. Indeed the figure in respect of the south side of the River Lee has risen proportionately with £2 million now being paid by way of subsidy by the Department of Social Welfare to the Southern Health Board in order to supplement people's accommodation costs.</P>
    <P>Of course, I welcome the fact that people are being housed somewhere but it cannot be denied that there are unscrupulous people here who are ripping off the system.  I would ask the Minister, along with his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, to examine those figures very carefully; they can be ascertained from the southern Health Board.  Indeed the problem can be easily identified.  Applicants on the Cork Corporation housing list have to go into private accommodation, sometimes of intolerable standard, and pay between £50 and £80 weekly, subsidised by the taxpayer, which goes into the coffers of unscrupulous landlords who have perceived this to be a growth industry.  That is a reflection on how we spend public moneys and look after our people.  I would ask the Minister again to examine this issue very carefully.  Indeed if that £2 million was expended on local authority housebuilding programmes it would at least go some way to tackling the present housing problem.</P>
    <P>Any public representative involved in housing will verify what I am saying, that there is a housing crisis.  The demands for housing have increased gradually over the years.  There is no way of meeting <Col N="1415" /> those demands except through the building of houses.  While I appreciate the point the Minister made, that large housing schemes are no longer acceptable, at the same time, Cork Corporation, like other local authorities, have shown that they have the expertise, willingness and ability to undertake first-class housing schemes which would be of benefit in urban renewal, inner city renewal and which would be effective and a credit to any local authority.  I have first-hand experience of this.  I have personally witnessed the misery caused thousands of families who, with two and three children, must live in flats, sometimes without water or sanitary facilities and pay exorbitant rents.  Indeed the present public housing programme condemns them to live in those conditions for the foreseeable future.  That is not a quality of life of which we can be proud.  The Minister referred to the public water supply and sanitary services programme which is a challenge to all of us.  I accept that but must point out that some people will not meet that challenge and, in such circumstances, others will suffer.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made on certain issues.  I hope the Environment Protection Agency will get off the ground.  A number of amendments from the Opposition parties have been incorporated but much more has to be done. There is an urgency at this time to tackle housing and the job situation which, of course, can be related to the environment. There are no major problems. If we are realistic we can sit down with the people who are willing to come into the country with industry and any fears can be allayed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the points I have made here.  People are anxious to provide for themselves in the best environment they can find, but that requires funding and local authorities cannot provide that funding.  At present they are working on outmoded formulae.  They are doing their best but it is not good enough because people are paying taxes and they expect some return for those <Col N="1416" /> taxes.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that there is a huge crisis in Cork and if possible make extra funding available so that the housing crisis can be met.</P>

      <P>The passing of the treaty on European union by the Irish people will be of enormous benefit to the Department of the Environment.  The use of Structural Funds up to now has led to major improvements to our national road network, and when Cohesion Funds become available for the Department of the Environment we will see further major improvements in that network.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer in particular to a national primary road of tremendous importance in my constituency.  This road stretches from Cork city to the Kerry county boundary and from there into Killarney.  The Kerry side of this stretch of roadway is in a pretty good condition, but a major portion of the roadway from Crookstown to the Kerry county boundry is in a deplorable state.  This roadway is more appropriate to by-gone days than it is to modern vehicular traffic.  I strongly urge the Minister to ensure that this stretch of roadway is treated as a priority when funds become available.  I have little doubt that the failure over the years to address this main artery between counties Cork and Kerry has had a serious adverse economic effect on both counties and on the city of Cork in particular.  Any work carried out on this roadway should coincide with the building of the by-pass to Macroom town.  It is impossible for visitors to the town to stop, and traffic congestion in the centre of Macroom town is an everyday occurrence.  Macroom town is suffering as a result, and the present situation is a cause of tremendous frustration to all motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on the subject of roads, I would like to mention the road from Mallow to Killarney between Longueville House and Lombardstown Cross. The stretch of roadway concerned measures approximately three kilometres <Col N="1417" /> and again the condition of this road is causing serious traffic congestion. Cork County Council have not touched the road for the best part of ten years.</P>
    <P>While the roads leading from the east and south-east coast into Cork city are a credit to the Department and the engineering staff of Cork County Council, the condition of the aforementioned roads leaves much to be desired.  This, of course, is not the fault of the Cork County Council engineering staff but rather of the EC inspired policy of major improvement works on national primary roads on the east coast to the detriment of road arteries along the south-west and west coast.  If this EC-directed policy only serves to make the richer counties richer and the poorer counties poorer, it can only lead to a similar disparity within the county.  I know the Minister for the Environment understands the situation and I have every confidence that he will ensure a more equitable distribution of funds for roads in future.  If it is to be the only contribution he makes to his Minister &mdash; I have no doubt there will be many more &mdash; he will leave an indelible mark on the Department of the Environment. I thank the Minister for responding so positively to my representations about a £3 million sewerage scheme for my home town of Kanturk. This work is now under way and will be completed in the next 12 to 18 months.  I strongly recommend the Minister to make moneys available for the laying of new footpaths and new streets in this rapidly developing provincial town when work is completed.</P>
    <P>I have been made aware by my constituents of a very serious water problem in the village of Banteer, north Cork. About 25 years ago Cork County Council built a reservoir at the bottom of a hill. Unfortunately, time has caught up with the reservoir because new farming technology means that following heavy rain slurry and fertiliser spread on the highlands flow into this reservoir from surrounding hills.  This is disgraceful in his day and age.  Naturally, the people of Banteer are quite alarmed by this ongoing problem.  I know the Minister <Col N="1418" /> will agree that this is unacceptable and that in these circumstances he will do everything in his power to assist Cork County Council to solve the problem. Indeed, Cork County Council have acquired a water source on an alternative site and I ask the Minister here today to instruct Cork County Council to proceed with that development immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also be aware of my representations about the sale to an individual of eight and a half acres of land by Cork County Council for the nominal sum of £1,000.  This land forms portion of a 16-acre holding which Cork County Council purchased for £47,000 of taxpayer's money in 1987, a short five years ago.  Cork County Council have made their argument about the sale and I have made mine.  Too often in the past the sale of property by statutory authorities has not been properly debated.  There should be greater monitoring of the sale of public assets and a number of valuations should be acquired before any sale proceeds.  At least two-thirds of the members of the statutory authority should agree to such a sale.  In this instance, in particular, I ask the Minister, Deputy Smith to ensure this matter is investigated fully before any sale proceeds.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister warmly on his appointment and wish him every possible success.  Judging by his past record I have no doubt he will be a resounding success in this Department.  I hope he will consider all my recommendations seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech introducing this Estimate was a great disappointment. In it we see no indication of the Government's policy in the area of the environment.  We see no indication of any new direction and there is really no message in it, apart from the fact that the Minister is managing a budget of £620 million.  In the limited time available to me I want to deal with a number of specifics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is a topic which is now becoming the most urgent environmental problem for the Minister and the Government, that is the crisis now facing <Col N="1419" /> the greater Dublin area with regard to waste disposal.  Within a period of four years there will be literally nowhere to dispose of the domestic and other waste that is generated in the greater Dublin area.  At present the Dublin region produces almost one million tonnes of waste per year.  The total remaining capacity in the landfill sites in which this waste is now dumped is only three million tonnes, enough to last a little more than three years.  The Ballyogan and Friarstown tips are due to close by the middle of next year, leaving no refuse disposal facility whatever in south Dublin.  Following the diversion of the south county waste, Dunsink dump is likely to close in early 1994.  Although Balleally has some additional capacity, it too will close within five years if it has to take the entire waste of Dublin.  Dubliners are now facing the prospect of there being nowhere to dump their refuse within four or five years.</P>
    <P>The response by the Dublin local authorities to this crisis has been to purchase a site at Kill, County Kildare, bale the Dublin waste and transport it by road to that site.  However, this proposal has encountered strong local opposition.  The site is near a disused former toxic dump and it is close to the water supply for Dublin city and county.  There is no guarantee that planning permission will be granted for the dump.  In any event, the thinking which lies behind the Dublin local authorities' approach to this dump, which is based on a reliance on land fill dumping, has been environmentally discredited.</P>
    <P>The Minister has just returned from the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.  In his speech he spoke about the efforts the Government will now be making to try to implement some of the aspirations outlined at that conference.  The Dublin waste crisis will be the first test of the Government's commitment to the new environmental thinking outlined out at the Rio conference.  Quite simply, the Dublin local authorities are not in a position to solve this waste crisis on their own. They have been put into the position of <Col N="1420" /> having to approach the problem purely on the basis of land fill dumping because we do not have a national waste policy or waste management plan.  We have been promised on a number of occasions waste management legislation but so far it has not appeared.  If it takes more than a year to introduce this legislation and prepare a national waste management plan, it will be too late so far as Dublin is concerned. We need action now.</P>
    <P>We need an approach similar to the approach taken by Denmark in dealing with its waste management problems.  It adopted a waste management Act about 15 years ago which sought to solve the problem by reducing waste at source and recycling.  Denmark has managed since then to reduce its requirement for land fill dumping and the disposal of waste by more than half.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to allow a situation to develop whereby within four or five years the area with the largest concentration of population will not have anywhere in which to dispose of its waste. The approach currently being pursued has been environmentally discredited and is out of date.  We will regret it in years to come.  I ask the Minister to bring forward whatever plans he has for a waste management Bill and to introduce a national waste management policy urgently and in time to address the waste disposal problem we are now faced with in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to local government reform.  When we were debating the local government Bill last year we were told that the elections for urban district councils and town commissioners were being postponed, it was intended to introduce legislation this year and elections for urban district councils and town commissioners would be held this summer. This has not happened.  According to the Minister's speech, the legislation will not now appear until early 1993.  If some of the political predictions being made are correct, the plans to introduce that legislation in early 1993 might be interrupted <Col N="1421" /> by other events, including perhaps a general election in which case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I worried about this issue last year and my worries were borne out. We did not have local elections this year. I am worried that we may not have elections to urban councils, town commissioners and sub-county structures next summer either.  By next summer it will have been eight years since members were elected to urban councils and town commissioners.  It cannot be described as democracy, and, in particular, local democracy of any kind if there is such an interval between the time people elect their urban councillors and when they have to seek re-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members, including the previous speaker, referred to the problem of roads.  I wish to refer to this issue also. In his speech the Minister referred to the work which is taking place, assisted by the EC, on national roads.  Our non-national roads are falling asunder not just in Banteer and County Cork but throughout the country.  All Members could list roads in their constituencies which are in serious need of repair.  For example, in my constituency Wyattville Road, Barnhill Road and Ballinclea Road are in need of repair.  The Minister's answer to these questions about this problem is to state that the State grants for non-national roads are intended to supplement and not replace the expenditure on non-national roads financed by local authorities from their own resources.  Where does the Minister expect local authorities to get the resources to maintain and carry out the necessary upgrading required on non-national roads?  It is a simple fact of life that local authorities do not have those resources because of the degree to which the funding of local authorities has been cut back in recent years.  The point made by the Minister in his speech ignores the critical fact that local authorities are very largely dependent on the Department of the Environment for their funding.  That <Col N="1422" /> funding has been cut in recent years and they are simply not in a position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the non-national roads, most of which are potholed, can be maintained by local authorities out of their own resources and he is not going to provide the money for them.  I am telling the Minister that the local authorities do not have the resources to maintain those roads.  If the Minister persists with that line of thinking then the condition of those roads will continue to deteriorate.  Many of those roads are already dangerous and contribute in large measure to the number of traffic accidents and fatalities that occur. Approximately 400 people are killed each year on our roads.  The local authorities do not have the resources with which to maintain them.  The Minister will have to change his attitude to the funding of non-national roads, which are in critical need of repair.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first time I have spoken in this House in the presence of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, I should like to belatedly congratulate him on his appointment.  I have no doubt that he will bring the same enthusiasm, energy and pragmatism to this ministry as he brought to the other portfolios he has graced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available to me I should like to concentrate on roads and general infrastructure.  The outstanding problem with which we have to deal today is our colossal unemployment level.  The need to create jobs is obvious; this is of paramount importance and must be addressed urgently and expeditiously. This problem can be solved by adhering to the overwhelming decision by the Irish people recently to continue along the road of greater integration with our partners in Europe, thereby availing of the economic opportunities open to us.  We need to attract more foreign investment in Irish-based industry.  We must ensure <Col N="1423" /> that our existing industries are able to trade at a realistically competitive level in the large European market open to us. Due to our peripheral geographic location this can only be achieved by providing first-class infrastructural facilities. For example, our roads, ports, railways and so on must be brought up to the very highest standards.  Foreign investors and industrialists are interested, and will be interested, in establishing here, as Ireland will give them greater access to EC markets.  These prospective investors will look very closely at what we have to offer.  They will be particularly interested in our transportation and distribution facilities.  This is not conjecture on my part; it is proven fact, and I can quote evidence of it from experience in my constituency of Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The town of Arklow and its substantial south Wicklow hinterland has been devastated by unemployment in recent years due to the run-down of traditional industry. The IDA, to their credit, have placed Arklow and its hinterland top of the list of areas deemed to require special attention in terms of job creation.  IDA personnel have brought to Arklow many prospective investors who are interested in setting up industry in this country. While the town has many advantages in terms of the port, its skilled labour force and its geographic location <i>vis-á-vis</i> Rosslare and Dublin Airport, these potential investors invariably decline to come to the area.  In crude terms, they do not want to know, simply because they have a very understandable aversion to the congested nature of that town.</P>
    <P>Plans are now well advanced for the provision of a motorway &mdash; the Arklow by-pass &mdash; which will solve this problem. It is also planned to acquire land adjacent to the by-pass on which to build an industrial park, thereby providing the IDA with a worthwhile product to market. The people of Arklow and south Wicklow are looking to this new by-pass as a means of solving the congestion problem and, with it, the appalling unemployment problem.  This by-pass will greatly improve the route to Rosslare.  This main <Col N="1424" /> route which is of such vital importance to the Irish economy is a bottleneck.  Our viability in the context of the European market will certainly be enhanced when that project is put in place, and I earnestly ask the Minister to ensure that work will commence on it without delay.  I merely cite the example of Arklow to illustrate my point.  The importance of modernising and upgrading our national infrastructure is of paramount importance if we are really serious about Europe and about dealing with the unemployment malaise.</P>
    <P>In the area of tourism there is further evidence of the need for road improvement and upgrading.  In line with Government policy, growth in Irish tourism has been phenomenal over the last half dozen years &mdash; 3.2 million people are expected to visit our country this year, an increase of 68 per cent over 1985 when there were 1.9 million visitors.  These tourists are most welcome.  We have striven hard to attract them and when they come here we must look after them.  The difficulty is that our tourists arrive at peak periods. It is envisaged that over one million people will visit Ireland in the next couple of months, which is our peak holiday time.  This puts a major strain on our roads and other infrastructure.  Traffic jams are commonplace, particularly in popular destinations.  Already I see evidence of this in County Wicklow, with traffic jams in attractive, well loved and well visited places such as Glendalough, Wicklow town, Brittas Bay, Arklow, Blessington and so on due to the inadequacy of our roads.</P>
    <P>If the excellence of the Irish tourism product, which is geared to increasingly providing jobs, is to be maintained we must address this problem.  We must deal with our infrastructure, particularly our roads, and ensure that they are of sufficient standard.  We must provide a safe and comfortable facility for our tourists who are thankfully coming here in ever-increasing numbers.  Much improvement has been made, as has been outlined by the Minister, but much more needs to be done.  We must strive for excellence in <Col N="1425" /> this area and I am quite confident that the Minister will achieve that.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me I want to refer to the planning process, and I address this matter particularly to the Minister.  There are difficulties in the area of planning appeals and I have evidence of this in my constituency.  Planning appeals are submitted to An Board Pleanála by people who may be well meaning or perhaps by people who are merely being destructive, and it takes a lengthy period of time for An Bord Pleanála to deal with these appeals. Many applications have received a positive response from the local authorities, particularly in relation to industries and job creation projects, but the delays in An Bord Pleanála are an aversion to potential investors.</P>
    <P>In the town in which I live the company, Avondale Chemicals, have received planning permission for a £50 million extension but work is held up as a result of appeals to An Bord Pleanála. This company could employ 360 people tomorrow morning on the building of the extension to their plant, with the prospect of 100 permanent jobs on completion of the project, but the project is delayed because of the difficulties in An Bord Pleanála.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister and I know he has plans to deal with it.  If decisions in An Bord Pleanála were expedited it would help in our attempt to deal with the unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>As a consequence of the popularity of residing near the coast, the area surrounding Dublin Bay, with the exception of the Howth peninsula is now completely built up.  It is estimated that the population of the greater Dublin area is more than one million, or roughly one third of our population.  With such a large population in the Dublin Bay area there is a heavy demand on the bay receiving waters to dispose of the effluent from so many people living in a small area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pollution in Dublin Bay has an adverse effect on fishing, swimming and water contact sports and on general amenity <Col N="1426" /> and recreational uses.  I welcome the fact that seven beaches in the Dublin County Council area received blue flag awards, including, I am glad to say, the Burrow beach in Sutton.  It is very disappointing, however, that none of our beaches received the silver starfish award for water quality.  Dollymount beach, enjoyed by thousands of Dubliners, did not receive any award.  This surely indicates that the water quality in Dublin Bay is not up to the highest standards.  Dublin Bay, and adjoining areas, is a resource of immense value for recreational pursuits. It is estimated that the bay supports the recreation demands of up to 50,000 people.</P>

      <Quest>the reason three questions 4, 7 and 8 on the Leaving Certificate Ordinary Alternative mathematics Paper II contained material and a style of questioning which was explicitly excluded in the published syllabus; the reason such departures from the syllabus are permitted; whether his Department have a duty to ensure that examinations and syllabi are, within reason, in accordance with each other.</Quest>

      <P>The point raised by the Deputy has been made to my Department by one of the teacher unions.

It cannot be construed as being outside of what was prescribed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>My Department issued a circular to the authorities of primary and post-primary schools containing guidelines towards a positive policy for school behaviour and discipline for primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>School authorities were reminded in that circular that the managerial authority of each school is responsible for ensuring that a fair and effective code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> It is a matter for school management to ensure that the behaviour of pupils in their care is monitored and they should be sensitive to any incidents of bullying.</P>
    <P>Parents should make known to school management the existence of cases of bullying so that the school management can investigate them and take the necessary steps to eradicate them or apply sanctions to the culprits.</P>
    <P>My Department are anxious to ensure that school management authorities fully accept their responsibilities in his area and will bring to the attention of the relevant school management authority any complaint received with a view to having appropriate action taken by the school management to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>I have sanctioned the secondment of ten teachers during the 1992-93 school year to allow for the national implementation of the child abuse prevention programme. These teachers, in conjunction with social workers from the health boards, will organise and provide training for all teachers who have not already received such training.</P>
    <P>The programme was specifically designed for use in primary schools and covers all forms of child abuse including bullying.  Its aim is to prevent child abuse by equipping parents and teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect the children in their care.  Children are then taught safety skills in the normal classroom context and these skills are reinforced through discussion with their parents.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this programme will prove very beneficial to teachers in this difficult area.</P>
    <P>In the pre-service training of teachers the subject of bullying and how to deal with it is addressed as part of the primary teacher training course and in the courses leading to the Higher Diploma in Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that there is a major crisis, that there is an absolute dread on the part of hundreds of children, particularly at primary level, of fellow pupil tyranny, <Col N="1430" /> that some children are almost suicidal, that there is a massive cult of abuse and that there is an urgent need to establish a helpline similar to the childline service, in order to establish the degree of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a crisis, but I am concerned about increasing reports of bullying at schools.  I am sure the Deputy also saw a recent very distressing UK case which received much publicity.  That is the type of thing we want to try to avoid.  I will consider the Deputy's helpline suggestion to see whether the logistics of that are practical. We have introduced the &ldquo;stay safe&rdquo; programme in schools and there are three teams operating at the moment in the Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare areas.  I have now agreed to increase the number of teachers involved in that from three to 13 and while it is not enough, it will help to improve the situation.  The Deputy knows my determination to make sure that each board of management run their own show.  In the case of bullying I will be reminding boards of management that they must take effective action on a school by school basis.  I share the Deputy's concern about the increasing incidences of bullying.  We have taken some action and I will keep an eye on it.</P>

      <asker>Mr. J. Higgins</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether the inclusion of 56 prescribed poems for the Leaving Certificates higher English course is excessive; when the English course was last discussed by the Syllabus Committee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider the inclusion of 56 prescribed poems for the Leaving Certificate higher English course to be excessive.  This does not seem excessive for higher level students, particularly as they have a wide range of choice within the prescribed material. Candidates for the examination are not obliged to study all of the poetry prescribed. Because of the generous choice of poems and questions given in the examination, they need study only a relatively small number of the poems and poets prescribed in order to be well-equipped to answer the minimum number of poetry questions required.</P>
      <P>The wide range of poetry prescribed will encourage many students to read more than the required minimum, and this is considered desirable for higher level students.</P>
      <P>The practice in question has been in operation since the introduction of the present Leaving Certificate English syllabus. From the start, it has had the approval of the English Syllabus Committee, the Curriculum and Examinations Board and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment Course Committee, both of which succeeded that syllabus committee.</P>
      <P>The Council are currently examining syllabuses at senior cycle level but definitive decisions in regard to syllabuses at this level will not be taken until the structure of the senior cycle itself has been determined.  The Green Paper on Education will afford the opportunity for discussion and debate on the appropriate arrangements to be made at senior cycle. The Leaving Certificate English course was last discussed by the NCCA course committee in May 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former teacher, let me assure the Minister that the inclusion of 56 poems on the Leaving Certificate higher level English course is absolutely ridiculous.  Indeed the number has been increased.  The Minister may <Col N="1432" /> not be aware that students have to learn 56 poems in order to answer just one question; the student has to be able to parse, analyse and dissect every single line, and this exercise instead of nurturing and cultivating a love for a particular art form destroys any genuine affection in the hearts of the pupils for something that is beautiful in itself.  The Minister sees merit in the wide selection but students have to make random choices and there is a strong possibility that they may just decide to omit the poem that comes up on the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly examine what the Deputy says because there is a basic difference in our viewpoints.  I have been advised by the Department of Education that candidates are not obliged to study all the poems because of the choice and that they need only study a relatively small number of poems.  The Deputy says that it is essential to study all 56 poems and I would certainly be concerned if that is the case.  There seems to be a basic difference of opinion on the facts.  I have been advised it is not necessary to study all 56 poems but a small number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since different dialects are a feature of all spoken lan- <Col N="1433" /> guages, my Department accepted with the recommendation of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment that the syllabus for the aural examination in Irish at the Junior Certificate examination would contain examples from the three main dialects.</P>
      <P>In order that candidates would fully understand and interpret the words spoken in a dialect different from the candidate's own, the material on the tape was standardised, simplified and rationalised so as to remove words and expressions which might prove difficult.</P>
      <P>I am aware that, notwithstanding this arrangement and the fact that each passage was heard three times, some candidates had difficulty with passages spoken in an unfamiliar dialect.  Account will be taken of this in the marking of the relevant papers and in future arrangements related to the aural examinations.</P>

      <P>In one Waterford school it was stated that the average child had no idea of what was being said in the Donegal dialect.  Would the Minister not agree that even though he is sympathetic to students it will be difficult to make provision for such cases when marking the papers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a general note, I would like to discuss this with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment because as the Deputy may know, they recommended that students should be examined in the different dialects because the dialect is a feature of any spoken language.  I would like to have my Department discuss this with the NCCA because I can see that students may have great difficulties in dealing with a number of dialects and personally I would prefer if students had to deal with standardised Irish or if they were in a position to select a particular dialect and deal only with that.</P>
      <P>I will be conveying my strongly held views on this matter to the NCCA as soon as possible and will ask them to reconsider the matter.  In the meantime the marking system will reflect the difficulties students experienced.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from the introduction to this paper, which I published at Easter, the issue of gender equity pervades all aspects of the paper and includes the following six points programme to address imbalances: the development and publishing of a policy of gender equity in every educational institution and the reporting of progress in this area in the annual report; a gender balance being sought on all boards of management, staff selection committees and all other committees and boards in the education sector; a systematic examination and modification over time of all teaching materials, with priority given to materials for the younger age groups; a broadening of the education available to all students through the sharing of resources and in general greater linkages at local level leading to improved education for life, for work and for national and international citizenship; extension of co-education at primary and secondary levels; and greater participation by women at all levels of management in the Department.</P>

This is a very comprehensive report but it has not received the level of public acknowledgement it deserves.  In his reply the Minister referred to his introduction to the Green Paper and to the launch later this evening of the Green Paper.  Is the Minister aware that the education spokespersons have not been invited to the launch of the Green Paper even though it has been preempted by several newspaper articles and is in the hands of a considerable number of people?  This initiative was to herald a new era of partnership and dialogue in education, and not to invite the education spokespersons, apart from others interested in education is a very a bad start and has soured things considerably.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister give an assurance that there would be consultations with the IVEA before these amendments were brought in?  Would he agree that this assurance was dishonoured? Surely he would agree that the procedure was an appalling insult to public representatives since debate on <Col N="1437" /> these amendments had commenced in the House before any approach was made to the IVEA.  The Minister should admit that he and his predecessors have totally ignored the IVEA with regard to consultation on this very important Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that, as I reject the language used by the IVEA in describing my amendments.  I said in the debate on the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill that I am used to taking political charges but personal abuse in a document from the IVEA is not acceptable. I did not dishonour any commitment to the IVEA.  To the best of my recollection, I told them during my meeting with them that I would be looking at the Bill and that I had some amendments, but at no stage did I offer to give the IVEA a veto over any amendments I might introduce.  The amendments were introduced in the ordinary course and they are being currently dealt with by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must agree that his revised amendments were circulated to certain members of the vocational education committees.  I am a member of County Wicklow vocational education committee and I take grave exception to colleagues who work very closely together, all members of the Fianna Fáil Party, receiving details of the Minister's proposals.  There should have been a general approach to all members of the vocational education committees. The Minister's approach is reflected in the way he has treated the IVEA.  Having given a commitment to meet them, he did not agree to fulfil that commitment until the amendments had been brought into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that.  The changes which I proposed are well within the authority of the Minister for Education to propose.  We have had extensive consultations with the IVEA over months and years on this matter.  The proposed changes concern the governing body, the chairmanship, the staff and the lands.  We have had a number of <Col N="1438" /> discussions about such issues, although not specifically about the amendments.  I reject the notion that I cannot introduce an amendment to a Bill without getting prior approval from any organisation.  It is useful and wise to consult and I have done so as extensively as possible.  My recent absence from duty made it somewhat more difficult for me to engage in the kind of consultations in which I would normally have engaged, but that did not warrent the tirade of personal abuse levelled at me in a document issued by the IVEA.</P>
      <P>With regard to circularising members of the vocational education committees, I offered my apologies last night to any chief executive officer who felt aggrieved, compromised or embarrassed.  That was not my intention.  I drew up a briefing note on the Bill and asked that it be circulated to members of my own party in the vocational education committees. That would be normal.  I have subsequently arranged for all members of vocational education committees to receive exactly the same briefing note.  It should not have been distributed through the chief executive officer and I regret that.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister <Col N="1439" /> that when he met the IVEA the Bill had been published and amendments had been circulated by the then Minister, Deputy Davern, but that without any forewarning or consultation another group of amendments was introduced which severely restricted the role of the vocational education committees in relation to colleges.  It was a gross discourtesy, to say the least, that the body which represents those employers was not made aware by way of consultation before the publication of these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already responded with regard to consultation and the awarding of a veto to any organisation over proposed Government amendments.  While there were about 40 ministerial amendments, only four subjects were dealt with.  The lands vested in the vocational education committee are to be vested in the college.  That is not a sea change because the lands were previously for the sole use of the college. The provisions with regard to the governing body are almost identical to those proposed in the original Bill, apart from a small change in numbers.  The third change is that the staff are to be the staff of the colleges rather than of the vocational education committee, although they will retain the privileges and the status of the vocational education committee.  That has been widely welcomed by the staff associations in the colleges.  Finally, instead of the chairman being elected by the governing body, it is to be a ministerial appointment.  That is the sum total of the changes.  They are not dramatic but I accept that they give further power and authority to the governing body.</P>

      <P>The existing primary teacher training course cover aspects relating to reading disabilities and their remediation.  As part of the course leading to the Higher Diploma in Education, the teaching of children with reading disorder is dealt with either specifically or in the courses on the sociology or psychology of children. In the case of UCD a postgraduate diploma in compensatory and remedial teaching is also offered and a similar postgraduate course is provided by St. Patrick's College of Education.</P>
      <P>In-service training courses are provided by my Department on a regular basis dealing with the needs of pupils with learning disabilities.  In-service courses for remedial teachers cover a range of learning difficulties which teachers may experience in their work, including specific reading disabilities or disorders.</P>
      <P>In the Green Paper on Education, which I will publish later today, I will be emphasising the need for the early identification of pupils with learning problems, so that remedial action can be taken at the earliest possible stage of their education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that about 10 per cent of students have reading disabilities and that there are two particular disabilities, dyslexia and scotopic sensitivity syndrome, SSS, which means that a student looking at an ordinary page of writing sees it as virtually unintelligible?  In relation to scotopic sensitivity syndrome is the Minister aware that the only recognised treatment is by way of special lenses but that the franchise for those lenses is held entirely by two people in this country, one in Cork and one in Dublin?  They have nine regional diagnosticians and the initial diagnosis costs £35.  One has then to go for a further examination which costs £70 and the lenses cost a further £200, a total of over £300.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="1442" /> to have this matter investigated as a matter of urgency to see what can be done, particularly for persons in lower income families and who have reading disabilities.  The service then required is not within their financial remit or capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly undertake to examine the matter because I would be concerned if the problem was widespread.  Of the 3,200 schools or so, about 1,400 &mdash; approximately 40 per cent &mdash; have either full time or shared remedial teachers but I would like to see the number increased as soon as possible. Many areas do not have a requirement for remedial teachers.  I am aware of the problem with dyslexia and SSS.  I have personal experience in my own family of one of those conditions so I am well aware of the need for the glasses and so on which the Deputy described.  I will respond to his suggestion to examine the cost element.  I was not aware that the franchise is held by only two people in the country.  I will have the matter examined with a view to the service being made more widely available.</P>

I am glad to know he will look into the matter.  I also want to refer to the matter of hearing on which I had a reply from the Minister yesterday.  The case concerns a child who is deaf and who had been provided with a radio aid by the health board in 1986.  In his reply the Minister said that was sufficient.  It is not sufficient.  The child is going into secondary school now and needs a new radio aid for his hearing aid which will cost £1,000.  He is from a working class family who do not have a medical card so they will not get assistance.  I would appreciate if the Minister would examine that case also.  Is he prepared to undertake too, to examine question of help for those with reading disabilities?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>As is the case with all major school building projects the proposed extension for Longwood vocational school has been reviewed on a regular basis by my Department in the context of demographic trends and projected short and long term enrolments.  The most recent review revealed that: the current enrolment of pupils in the school is only 161 &mdash; this figure represents a decline of 25 per cent in enrolment since 1982; the school attracts only 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the pupils leaving primary schools in the catchment area; and the output from these primary schools is expected to drop by 22 per cent in the short term.</P>
      <P>In the light of the current and likely future enrolment trends in Longwood vocational school my Department, in consultation with County Meath vocational education committee are considering how best provision can be made for the pupils of this school in the future. Pending a decision in this regard the proposed extension to the school cannot be advanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>My interests range far and near.  The reality is that this school will be closed in four years time.  One of the reasons is that there has been canvassing of the Longwood primary schools by the Trim secondary schools to ensure there are not too many new entrants going forward to the Longwood vocational school.  That matter is totally out of order.  I would ask the Minister to come clean on this and say he intends to close this school in four years time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I share a constituency and we know all about canvassing.  I am aware it goes on in the educational world also.  I have informed the Deputy of the survey which is taking place in that area.  The current enrolment of pupils in the school is 161. That figure represents a decline of 25 per cent in enrolment since 1982.  The school attracts only about a quarter of all the pupils leaving primary schools in the catchment area.  Faced with those figures the proposed extension of the school cannot be advanced at this stage.</P>

      <P>The home/ school/community liaison programme commenced at primary level in 1990 and was extended to the post-primary sector in 1991.  It is being monitored by a national steering committee and is subject to ongoing evaluation by the Educational Research Centre.  In the 1991-92 school year the programme was in operation in 93 schools with a total combined enrolment of around 35,000 pupils.</P>
      <P>The indications emerging to date from the operation of the scheme are very favourable and show a positive response on the part of all those involved in the scheme, particularly the target groups.  It is intended to undertake a comprehensive overall review of the scheme over the next six months in order to establish whether any refinements or adjustments to the present scheme are required.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to extend the programme further to include 15 additional schools catering for a combined enrolment of 9,000 pupils in the post primary sector for the 1992-93 school year.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not <Col N="1446" /> agree that there is a decrease in discipline in our schools and that educational disadvantage continues to expand in our society?  If these problems are to be dealt with comprehensively the extension of home school links is the solution because schools cannot deal with these problems in isolation.  This would be a sensible use of resources.  The greatest degree of success would be gained in dealing with the problems in the context of the home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  This scheme is very exciting.  It is one thing to deal with pupils in the classroom but to achieve success their home situation has to be understood, particularly in relation to those from disadvantaged areas.  As the Deputy knows, the scheme was launched in 1990 and 30 teachers were appointed as co-ordinators in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>That number has now increased to 45. I plan to extend the scheme to 15 more schools immediately.  I shall be keeping a close eye on the scheme in the next few months to monitor how it is operating. This is precisely the kind of scheme that is needed.  The feedback from schools involved in it is very good.  Teachers are going into the homes for discussions with parents and they are involving the parents in the pupils' school work.  That is critical in disadvantaged areas in particular in order to ensure that pupils stay in the schools and that teachers understand the family background.</P>

      <P>The commitment is now two years old and I should like to know if any second level schools have been identified for the purpose of establishing links with identified third level colleges to improve participation rates.  How many staff have been appointed or assigned to third level institutions in order to build up those links, which was also part of the commitment?</P>

      <P>Progress is not moving at anywhere near the rate I should like it to move, which is why I emphasised strongly in the Green Paper that progress in this area would have to move much more quickly.  I am aware that a number of schools have been identified by several third level institutions. For example, Dublin City University have several lectures visiting schools in their area in an effort to establish links. A number of the other third level institutions are adopting a similar approach. I do not have a figure of the number of staff involved but I am seeking to encourage all third level institutions to establish links with schools in disadvantaged areas in order to ensure that there is a flow from those schools to third level institutions.  I have to get more details from the universities and third level institutions about this matter.  I am <Col N="1448" /> not satisfied that they are making progress as quickly as they should.  The performance of some institutions is better than that of others.  I intend to put the matter before them in much more trenchant terms.</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of the comments by Deputy Gilmore.  Is the Minister aware that at this stage a major impetus is needed?  The problem has been diagnosed, as has its extent, and we are very strong in relation to prescriptions but we fall down when it comes to funding those arrangements.  Does the Minister realise that there are huge areas of this city, particularly on the north side, where the participation rate is less than 1 per cent?  Will the Minister accept that until such time as we devote geater resources towards getting those people to continue at second level education and follow on into third level education we will not break the social logjam that exists?</P>
      <P>In relation to ESF grants, will the Minister abandon his plan and have the ESRI re-examine the merits of the third level system <i>in toto?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at third level has improved dramatically.  The number of students receiving grants, aid and so on has also increased dramatically. Much of the improvement is seen in the disadvantaged areas.  Forty per cent of school leavers now take up third level education.  Back in 1980 that figure was only 20 per cent.  It is hoped that in a short period the figure will reach 45 per cent.  There are 75,000 students now enrolled at third level institutions, an increase of 60 per cent in the past decade. It is envisaged that that number will increase by perhaps another 20 per cent between now and 1995 or 1996.  More than half of all students are in receipt of State support.  Under those schemes, and the growth that has taken place, many students from disadvantaged areas are being picked up.  The real answer is to improve the retention rates at second level education.  Universities, and other third level institutions, can do something <Col N="1449" /> in that regard.  If the retention rates at second level education can be improved there will be a better chance of increasing the participation rate at third level education. I shall again remind third level institutions of their commitment to establish the links and I shall report to the House on that again at a later date.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's query about ESF grants is a separate issue.  However, the Deputy knows that the current position is that it is proposed to proceed in the autumn.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the thrust of the approach he has taken in relation to the regional technical colleges legislation, in other words, the serving of the vocational education committee link, runs completely counter to the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i> The vocational education committee arrangement in regard to second level schools and third level colleges provided a link between those schools and colleges previously and the severing of that link will run counter to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitment.  Has the Minister given any thought to the way the new regional technical college in Tallaght might establish links with second level schools in that area with a view to increasing participation rates?</P>

      <P>The vocational education committees have not been abolished. They still exist and play a key role.  They carry out a whole range of functions.  I introduced four simple but important amendments, which I told the House about earlier.  They do not denude the vocational education committees to any great extent.  Some authority is pushed further down to the boards but the vocational education committees can still play a very valuable role in forming the kind of links between second level and third level education that the Deputy would wish for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the regional technical <Col N="1450" /> college in Tallaght, I shall certainly ensure that the college are well aware of their duty to make those links with second level schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 13, 16, 73, 78 and 85 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have received information about AIDS Care Education and <Col N="1451" /> Training (ACET) which is a charitable organisation formed in London in 1988 as a christian response to AIDS.  As I understand it, this association is involved in both educational activity about HIV/AIDS and in promoting the care and welfare of persons affected by HIV/AIDS.  This latter matter would be largely for the Department of Health. The Deputy will be aware that my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, developed an educational package for schools on HIV/AIDS and a major dissemination and training programme involving the organisation of 26 inservice seminars has just been completed.  The evaluation of this programme will be carried out in the early autumn and the contribution of other agencies and use of other programmes will be considered in the context of this evaluation.  I look forward to further contact with ACET and indeed with various groups and agencies during the further development of our educational approach to HIV/AIDS in the context of the Government's overall strategy on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and especially for his comments about the developments that are taking place <i>vis-á-vis</i> secondary schools and the urgent necessity for education in relation to this illness, which is causing much concern. Has the Minister considered the effectiveness of the education awareness programme that is currently in vogue in the North of Ireland?  Based on the success of that programme, has the Minister taken on any modules for use in the package that has been developed and introduced in the schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In our own programme that has been disseminated to schools we have taken account of the practice in several other areas.  I am not able to say specifically whether the Northern Ireland programme was taken in, but I would be surprised if it was not. The UK, including Northern Ireland, is involved in the ACET approach.  We are <Col N="1452" /> keeping up with what they are doing. Incidentally, if ACET wish to have further discussions with my Department they will facilitate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his assurances in regard to this matter. However, while an educational package is helpful, in the vast majority of cases it is not being used in the schools because we cannot get enough people to take the courses to which the Minister referred. Instead of the educational package being left in the staff room, we need a positive, promotional and pro-active campaign to give explicit, sensitively delivered tuition to people in relation to the horrendous consequences of AIDS, how it can be avoided and the measures and steps which should be taken.  As Deputy Finucane said, there is a proven module in the North of Ireland, which is cost effective and working well.  They are more than anxious to make it available down here if we are receptive to the idea. We should have serious dialogue with them and look at its merits because it does work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will initiate discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities about that module to see if it would work for us.  I would be disappointed if boards of management permitted documentation in this regard to lie unused in staff rooms, and I ask all boards of management and principals to ensure that that does not happen and that they live up to their responsibilities in the area of care, attention and advice.  It may differ from school to school and it might not be suitable to over-standardise it because the boards of management in some areas may feel they wish to handle it in a different way and, therefore, they should be given flexibility.  I ask all boards of management to use the material sent to them for this purpose.</P>

      <P>My Department have participated with various agencies, both statutory and voluntary, in support of schools introducing educational programmes on substance abuse, including other drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco. The agencies concerned include the Department of Health, regional health boards, the National Youth council and the Mater Dei Adolescent Counselling Centre as well as parents' groups.  My Department are represented on the Government's Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Misuse and contribute to the development of the national strategy to prevent such misuse.</P>
      <P>Substance abuse education is incorporated in the general, social and personal education provision of many schools and my Department have organised in-service training programmes for teachers in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Mater Dei Adolescent Counselling Centre.</P>
      <P>In order to develop further initiatives in this area the Departments of Education and Health began a major development project in eight post-primary schools last school year with a view to (a) developing educational resource materials for schools; (b) gaining information on how best to integrate the activity in the wider curriculum; and (c) examining the in-service support needed by teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project is supported by the EC. At the end of the first year of this project, which will be continued during next school year, the evaluative feedback is <Col N="1455" /> very positive.  The materials are being modified now to take account of classroom experience.

Because of the increase I am sure the Minister will agree that the present measures are not effective.

      <P>It is difficult to get hard material in relation to the extent of the lack of education in the areas to which the Deputy referred.  However, I know that it is not adequate and I am concerned about it.  The Department have been active in this area by producing videos, teaching materials, supporting summer schools and Mater Dei, advising regional health boards and facilitating the distribution of materials by the National Parents' Council.  As the Deputy knows, the development project includes eight schools in a pilot scheme which is now led by two psychologists; a teacher has been seconded and I am told that the reaction has been very positive.  We hope to finalise the resource material after next week's seminar and we will then roll it out in phases, starting in late 1992.  We have been extremely active in this area but it is a problem which must be continually monitored.</P>

On the drug abuse programme run by the Department <Col N="1456" /> of Education, will the Minister give details of what is being done to educate young people in relation to alcohol and its effects and what a lethal drug it can be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most schools now have very strong programmes to bring to the attention of their pupils the dangers of the misuse of drugs, including alcohol and tobacco.  The Deputy is correct in saying that in regard to drugs we tend to think of hard drugs and forget that alcohol can do substantial damage, in particular to young people.  The Department continually remind boards of managements and principals of the need to bring to the attention of pupils the dangers associated with alcohol.  There are specific school programmes to deal with it.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that the present programme is being implemented only on a pilot basis in eight schools and that we have over 4,000 primary and post-primary schools, if our programmes are to be effective to counter this great threat to society the Minister should consider making health education, which would include a programme on substance abuse, a core subject on the curriculum in both primary and post-primary schools.</P>

      <P>That is not the way to handle the issue.  While this programme is being implemented on a pilot basis in eight schools for a particular purpose, it would be wrong of me to give the impression that only eight schools are addressing the question of drug abuse, because there are other schemes in operation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the alcohol-drugs programme is not working and that the statistics speak for themselves?  Alcohol is the greatest scourge nationally and it is affecting our national performance.  There is a need therefore in aclohol programmes in schools to deglamourise drinking to show it for what it is and to relate it to crime. Recently I spoke to a county registrar who informed me that seven out of every ten cases that are heard in court are drink-related, be it vandalism, burglary or cases involving broken homes.  We need to deglamourise drink for young people at the time they are most susceptible and receptive to such messages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, it seems that there has been an increase in the number of students who drink.  I have no statistical evidence to show this &mdash; it is only an observation &mdash; but I am concerned about it.  The most practical and easiest thing to do in the short term would be to ask the principals in all our schools, who are very experienced, to make the alcohol programme and counselling in the schools work.  I am confident that if they focus on it they will be able to make it work.  The Department will offer them every support.  I share the Deputy's concern but not one step will resolve it; a number of steps are required. However I have great faith in the principals of our schools and I am confident that if the Department provide the necessary technical back-up they can be effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the educational programme, any progress made should be welcomed but this problem is reaching horrendous proportions in some areas.  Would the Minister consider the possibility of setting up task forces, as an extension of the home-schools liaison programme, in those schools where the problem is particularly acute with regard to under-age drinking and the use of illegal drugs, and making provision for the involvement of the Garda and social agencies, both voluntary and statutory? We are not doing enough to resolve the <Col N="1458" /> problem and it appears to be getting worse.  There is therefore a need for urgent action.  I believe that we could achieve a lot by setting up task forces in those areas where the problem is particularly acute.  Not alone must we deal with the problem in the home but we must also ensure that the law is enforced and provide an educational programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the home-school liaison programme is to keep the problem to the forefront of people's minds.  The extension of that scheme can play a leading role in tackling his difficulty.  I will give some thought to the Deputy's suggestion that I set up a task force but I do not think that this would work well on a school by school or area by area basis as it might lead to a stigma being attached to a particular area.  However perhaps a case can be made for bringing together a number of experts at national level to study the matter afresh.  Given that the Deputy has expressed concern about this matter, I will consider this suggestion.</P>

I understand, however, that an application has been forwarded very recently in respect of a ballcourt at the school and this application is being processed in the normal way.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 35, 42, 43, 48, 52 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> I have no plans at present to review the terms of reference of teachers providing education services at detention centres for young offenders.  The overall operation of these centres, including the education service provided, is subject to ongoing review by my Department to ensure that the objectives of rehabilitation through care and education are fully met.</P>
    <P>I take it, the Deputies' questions are prompted by the recent decision by County Dublin Vocational Education Committee to withdraw from its involvement in the provision of the education service to Oberstown boys and girls centres. While I regret the fact the vocational education committee should have considered it necessary to take such a decision, I am satisfied that the role required of the teachers in question was no different from that currently operating very satisfactorily in the other centres for young offenders for which my Department are responsible.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the nature of these centres and the background of many of the inhabitants are such that problems of discipline can and do arise both inside and outside the classroom. Given this reality, it is absolutely essential that all staff, be they teaching staff or care staff, operate as part of a multi-disciplinary team and work in support of each other, particularly where dificulties with discipline arise.  Such inter-disciplinary support is essential to the maintenance of order in the centres and has been successfully achieved in all centres in the past.</P>
    <P>In the particular case of the centres at Oberstown, which were newly opened in September 1991, the Department departed from their traditional practice of direct recruitment of teaching staff by the centres themselves.  Instead, it was decided to seek to bring a stronger vocational dimension to the education programme by engaging County Dublin vocational education committee to recruit the necessary teaching staff.</P>
    <P>However, experience with this method of recruitment has proved unsatisfactory in that the teachers thus appointed, <Col N="1461" /> unlike their counterparts in other centres, have displayed ongoing reluctance to view their role as part of the wider inter-disciplinary team.  As a consequence, they have been unwilling to undertake the necessary level of involvement in dealing with matters of discipline and disruptive pupils.  Efforts on the part of my Department to resolve these difficulties had been ongoing for some time prior to the decision of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee to withdraw from the centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that his comment that teachers have displayed reluctance represents an attack on the integrity of the fine teachers who during the years have provided an excellent service in Oberstown and other youth detention centres and on the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee? Does the Minister realise also that two weeks ago a female teacher was pulled to the ground with the flex of a tape recorder around her neck held by a detainee; that another teacher was held by a pupil as a fellow detainee subjected her to martial arts style kicks; that other teachers have been bitten; that even though the panic button which teachers carry around was pressed there was no response until long after the damage was done; and that there is a fear that there will be loss of life and limb?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not want my comments to be interpreted as a slight on the teachers involved.  I simply stated the fact that they have displayed ongoing reluctance to see their role as a multi-disciplinary one and take the view that theirs is purely a teaching one.  I respect that decision of theirs &mdash; perhaps I should have said that &mdash; but we would require them to take a broader view beyond the simple teaching functions.  If they decide not to take that view, then I respect their decision, as I respect the decision of the vocational education committees not to expose their staff to any form of danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would join Deputy Jim Higgins in totally condemning and expressing regret at any incidents of violence in these institutions. <Col N="1462" /> In similar institutions the staff are recruited directly.  Perhaps it was not the right way to proceed in the first instance, that is to seek to deal with it in the manner we did by trying to separate, on a strict basis, the teaching function as opposed to the disciplinary, almost custodial function.  Having said that I want to make clear that, for example, Oberstown and similar centres are not prisons; open settings prevail, with rehabilitation through encouragement rather than by way of penal measures.  A number of meetings have been held on this issue.  We have endeavoured to be more specific about the panic buttons, insisting on formal weekly meetings. Indeed a new focus is being put on those weekly meetings and on the need to respond immediately to those panic buttons.</P>
    <P>I might add that, apart from teachers, there are educational co-ordinators, care staff and senior management at these centres.  The teachers take a different view.  Perhaps, in the first instance, it was unfair of us to ask teachers to take a broader view but other institutions where teachers have been recruited directly have agreed to take that broader view. That is what I propose to do in this area &mdash; recruit teachers with a broader responsibility, and do that directly.  It is quite clear, given the type of institutions these are, that it is not simply possible to be just a teacher; the role has other sides to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of what category of teacher the Minister now decides to recruit &mdash; and I understand that they themselves will provide the new type of service with fewer teachers &mdash; at the end of the day one is talking about providing education.  Would he agree that the kind of education provided by vocational education committee teachers was ideal in such circumstnaces in that it was practical, manual and imparted skills.  Would the Minister agree that, at the end of the day, irrespective of what category of teacher one recruits, one cannot impart knowledge or skills if there is basic insecurity?  Would he agree that <Col N="1463" /> what is needed in such circumstances is a number of care staff on hand to respond quickly to the types of circumstances that invariably arise?  In addition, would he agree that team teaching, with two teachers together, one complementing the other, would be a good idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only issue on which Deputy Jim Higgins and I disagree, is that, given the nature of these institutions where there will be youngsters on long remand stay &mdash; at the same time stressing that they are not prisons but remand centres &mdash; it would be nice if a teacher could be just a teacher.  Unfortunately, in those institutions, to an extent everybody must understand the other's discipline.  On the one hand, they must look after their own discipine, be that teaching, administration co-ordination, care staff &mdash; all must do their job &mdash; but they must also know a little and, at times, in an informal way, be prepared to do the job of the others.  It is not possible to draw a demarcation line totally at teaching and contend that security and other matters are for everybody else because of their nature and the suddeness or urgency with which something can arise.  Therefore, it is not possible just to put teachers there; they must have a broader, inter-disciplinary function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether there has been any analysis made of the educational requirements of young offenders; for example, has any sociological research been conducted into the link between crime and the drop-out level at school?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot name a study or survey offhand for the Deputy but I will certainly check it out.  I am aware, though, that my Department continuously study how these centres work, and keep up with modern methods and information in regard to the link between crime and education and how we can best tackle the problem.</P>

      <P>Literacy issues are addressed as part of general education and training programmes as well as by specific literacy programmes.</P>
      <P>Specific provision is made under the adult literacy and community education scheme which is the basic programme aimed at combating illiteracy.  The provision in 1991 for the ongoing services provided under the scheme was £1 million. In addition, grants amounting to £77,000 were provided to the National Adult Literacy Agency.  A further £240,000 was provided for special initiatives, which included literacy for disadvantaged adults.</P>
      <P>In addition to these specific provisions, arrangements for literacy training are also included in a variety of other general education and training programmes, including programmes for early school leavers.  It is not possible to disaggregate the cost of the literacy element of these programmes.</P>
      <P>In view of the diversity of provision, the information sought in relation to the number of courses and attendances is not available and would take an inordinate amount of time to obtain.</P>
      <P>As the Green Paper on Education will show, I fully recognise the need to address literacy issues within a comprehensive programme.  I will have such a programme developed as a follow-on to the Green Paper discussions.</P>

      <P>In the Green Paper on Education I propose that we undertake a <Col N="1465" /> national survey of literacy because the relevant evidence and information is hopelessly out of date.  For example, the OECD report maintained that, in developed countries generally &mdash; which would obviously include Ireland &mdash; they perceive an alarmingly high incidence of what they call functional illiteracy, as opposed to what we normally regard as strict illiteracy.  Therefore, the OECD regard it as alarmingly high.  Certainly I would not disagree with their assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned the debate I was referring to the population explosion in the Dublin area.  I said that over the past 20 years Dublin had been completely built up, especially along coastal areas from Killiney to Howth Head.  I also mentioned the intolerable burden this placed on the effluent disposal systems within our city, especially on water quality within Dublin Bay.  For example, Dollymount beach, frequently used by Dubliners, received no award in the recent blue flag awards, proving that its water quality is of a low standard.</P>
      <P>This surely also indicates that the water in Dublin Bay is not of the desired high standard.  Dublin Bay, and adjoining areas, are a resource of immense value for recreational pursuits.  It is estimated that the bay supports the recreation demands of up to 50,000 people.  There is a case to be made for striving to achieve the highest water standards throughout the bay area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Half of Dublin's effluent is emptied untreated into Dublin Bay and that is the reason for the poor water standard.  I <Col N="1522" /> refer in particular to the north Dublin drainage scheme which serves all the north side of Dublin and caters for all housing estates, factories and hospitals. Surveys are being carried out with a view to establishing a sewage treatment plant before 1998.  Consultants have been appointed and are carrying out studies on the siting of the treatment works. There are rumours about three sites.  The first is Baldoyle racecourse, a high amenity area jealously guarded by its residents who want it to remain open and in green spaces.  The second is reported to be a landfill site in Howth, a scenic area of high amenity and a fishing and tourist centre.  The sailing club at Howth is renowned throughout the world.  The area attracts many tourists and surely the proposers of this scheme cannot consider Howth as a site for this treatment works. The other site proposed is along the sea front at St. Anne's Estate, Raheny, another high amenity area enjoyed by thousands of Dubliners.  The plant should not be sited there.</P>
    <P>The solution is to update the Ringsend plant to a tertiary treatment plant and link the north Dublin drainage scheme into it like the Dún Laoghaire scheme to ensure the sewage does not enter the bay in a raw state.  That would improve the water quality in Dublin Bay.  I hope the Minister will consider what I said when the plan comes before him.  Proper water quality in Dublin Bay will ensure that the bay's amenities for tourists are preserved. There are numerous jobs and a great deal of money in tourism.  The bay has marvellous beaches which tourists appreciate.</P>
    <P>We must look to the future.  Cycle ways are developing on the north side of the city.  One runs from the East Wall along the Clontarf Road.  It should be continued out to Sutton and linked up with the cliff walk at Howth.  If the cycle ways and walk ways are linked with the Hill of Howth the land swap about to take place there would ensure that the walkways will be in Dublin County Council's ownership.  The Minister should try to understand that Howth is constantly under threat from developers and others <Col N="1523" /> who want to build on scenic sites.  The Minister should consider instigating special amenity area orders.  I accept that is a matter for Dublin County Council, but as far as I know the Liffey valley special amenity area order was instigated from the Department.  The preparation of a special amenity area order requires a great deal of money and resources.  The Minister should make money available to Dublin County Council for that purpose.</P>
    <P>No debate on the Environment would be complete without mention of the housing crisis in Dublin city and county.  The Minister said he intends making money available to build approximately 7,000 housing units in the whole country. Reports indicate that there are 19,400 people on the housing lists.  This Estimate is not providing enough money to house people in need of housing.  There are 4,377 people on the Dublin Corporation list and 682 cases in my council area of Dublin-Fingal but they have no hope of being housed considering the money being provided in the Estimate.  Last year we built 23 or 24 houses in the Dublin County Council area and it is unlikely we will reduce this list in the near future. Money must be made available for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The shared-ownership scheme will make some contribution to relieving the housing crisis.  However, that scheme will not succeed unless it has the full support of solicitors, estate agents and auctioneers, and that the conditions of the scheme do not create difficulties in transfer of titles.  I hope there will be sufficient personnel in Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation to process the documents and so maintain the confidence of auctioneers and solicitors acting for persons selling houses in this scheme. The person selling a house is probably buying another house and is anxious to close the sale so that it will not be necessary to take a bridging loan.  The legal departments in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are very much overloaded.  They need more personnel and that costs money.  The Minister should consider that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> Other Deputies referred this morning to the condition of the roads.  We know about potholes and the amount of money necessary to keep our roads in a proper state.  A cause of concern in Dublin is Dublin Gas, the ESB and others who from time to time carry out works in estates.  In an estate in Sutton where town gas has been installed, the repair work carried out leaves much to be desired.  I inspected some of the work on this estate recently and it was a disgrace. Dublin Gas told me they subcontracted the work.  If road repair work is not up to standard our roads which we need to protect will deteriorate.</P>
    <P>In the Blue Lagoon high amenity area in my constituency between Clontarf and Sutton the causeway is silting because it cannot be scoured.  Local residents' groups and environmentalists are very anxious that this does not silt up completely and they have been asking for many years that the causeway be bridged and properly scoured.  In warm weather the odour from the silt and the algae which has accumulated there is very evident. I ask the Minister to examine this issue and to approach Dublin Corporation with a view to having the causeway bridged.</P>

      <P>I compliment the last speaker on introducing a new acronym into the English language.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about reform of local government for some time past.  In fact, when one thinks back over the past 20 years it seems to have been one of those topics which have been virtually talked to death.  Of course, there have been some very welcome improvements in the area of local government. For example, last year for the first time statutory recognitition was given to the general representational role of local government, the powers of local authorities <Col N="1525" /> were restated in broad terms and the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine was removed.  I believe the latter improvement was particularly welcome and was a very important step foward.</P>
    <P>We are still awaiting the report of the Institue of Fiscal Studies on local authority finance.  I have to say it is still a mystery to me why we need yet another study on the thorny issue of local government finance.  Over the past 30 years there has been in excess of a dozen reports on local government financing all of which have more or less come to the same conclusions: for example five reports by the interdepartmental committee on local finance and taxation, three of which were published; the White Paper published in 1972, which was followed by a discussion document, the NESC report and the Copeland Walsh study.  We all know that the only real alternatives, that is a local sales tax and a local income tax, are ultimately unworkable in our situation.  I believe we will inevitably head in the direction of some form of tax related to property ownership or capital, with perhaps appropriate abatements of income and linkages to the income tax system.  Of course, we all know the only way of making a real breakthrough and effecting a change in the system of local finance and taxation and, ultimately in the systeme of local government is the achievement for once of political consensus in this area.  I mention this point because there was consensus over the past few weeks on the very important issue of the ratification of the Treaty on European Union.  It might be no harm if in the months and years ahead, if it takes that long, we could establish some form of consensus on the way forward in the whole area of local finance and taxation.</P>
    <P>There are two other areas of local reform which I believe have not been sufficiently addressed.  In fact, they have been largely ignored.  One of these is the relationship between local authotities and their clients, the citizens and the community.  The second is effectivenes in the expenditure area.  One does not have to dig deep into either area to find appalling <Col N="1526" /> examples of things being done in a way they should not be done.  I should like to formally bring to the Minister's attention a case which illustrates a breakdown in the relationship between citizens and the administration at local level. Regrettably, this case occurred in my constituency and reflects just how complex public administration can become, including public administration at local level where it should not become complex. It also illustrates how bureaucracy, whether at central or local level, moves at a pace which is out of tune with the needs of citizens in the modern world.</P>
    <P>The case involves a young couple, Karen and Seán Blackburn.  They have no objection to their names being mentioned here as their plight has already been the subject of some often heated discussion at meetings of Wicklow County Council.  In autumn 1990 the Blackburns applied to Wicklow County Council for a site at Monastery in Enniskerry where the council were selling four sites.  In December 1990 they were told they would get a site.  In January 1991 they were told they would have to build a two-storey house on the site. The council promised to prepare suitable plans, which they did.  After the plans were prepared the planning application was duly lodged.  In May 1991 they were granted planning permission without any difficulty.  There were no objections by people from the locality and although the planning application was discussed at two area planning meetings there were no objections from councillors.</P>
    <P>The Blackburns also heard at that time about the proposal to introduce the shared ownership scheme.  They entered into immediate discussions with the county council, supported by me and other councillors.  I have to say Deputy Kavanagh played a very positive role in resolving some of the difficulties.  Both the Blackburns and I believe that they were not encouraged to look favourably on the scheme by the officials with whom they met.  The discouragements offered to the couple were such that I raised the matter at local level at that time and separately with the Department of the <Col N="1527" /> Environment.  These discouragements went on for some considerable time. However, the couple persevered and were finally accepted for the shared ownership scheme.  They would have been the first people to build on a site in Wicklow under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The issue dragged on until the end of 1991.  The couple had found a builder, got a quotation, and the bills of quantity, etc. were agreed.  It looked as if work would start sometime early in the new year.  However, extraordinary difficulties then began to emerge, first among the elected members of the county council. The section 83 order to dispose of the site to this couple should have come before the council in December 1991, but it did not.  It made its appearance on our agenda in January 1992.  For the first time in living memory a section 83 disposal order supported by the management of the council was opposed by a number of councillors.  The councillors held that an undertaking had been given as far back as 1984 by the county council officials not to build two-storey houses on the sites in question.  The officials disputed this.  The row dragged on for two months until March 1992 when the order was finally passed by the great majority of councillors after a number of debates, some of which could be described, in the most charitable terms, as unseemly.  It is interesting to note that the councillors who objected to the sale of the site at that time had no strong objection whatsoever when the issue was before the council for planning permission.</P>
    <P>In March 1992, almost 18 months after the start of their odyssey, the Blackburns looked forward to starting work on their house.  However, this was not to be.  The couple were told that the builder who had been engaged and who very decently had been biding his time in the wings for months would, under the terms of some Finance circular, be considered as a subcontractor to the county council because of the shared ownership scheme rather than as a main contractor for the building of the house.  It was suggested that as a sub-contractor he would need a C2 tax <Col N="1528" /> certificate before work would commence. For good measure, they were also told that he would need to be a member of the house guarantee scheme.  As every Member of this House knows, it takes months to get a C2 tax certificate and it takes some time to get into the house guarantee scheme.  I am at a loss to understand why these people could not have been informed about this in March, April, May or June 1991 instead of having to wait until March 1992.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment were approached by me and other public representatives. Both Departments disputed the need for a C2 tax certificate.  A copy of the relevant Finance circular was produced after an exchange of correspondence. This made it clear that a C2 tax certificate or a tax clearance certificate would be needed by the contractor. As the contractor had an exemplary tax record and an up-to-date tax clearance certificate it seemed as if the matter could be resolved.  However, this was not the case.  An earlier circular was produced which seemed to come down in favour of a C2 tax certificate. More importantly the heavy guns were brought into play in the form of an opinion from a local tax inspector who indicated it was his belief that a C2 tax certificate was needed because the house was being built under the shared ownership scheme.  One year and nine months into this saga the Blackburns have been approved for site purchase, planning permission and the shared ownership scheme but they have not been allowed to start work on their house.  Difficulties in locating legal papers relating to the site have now begun to emerge.  Having cleared a number of obstacles and hurdles, it seems we are heading into yet another brick wall.</P>
    <P>The shared ownership scheme is a good scheme.  I am on the record in this House and elsewhere as defending it as one of the most innovative moves in local government, particularly in the housing area.  I never suggested that it would solve all the housing problems but it should go a good way to solving problems for young <Col N="1529" /> couples in particular who are marginally below the level at which they can afford to provide private sector housing accommodation for themselves and their families. This should not be a complex scheme.  It should not be a scheme that would involve one in nine or 12 months of negotiations.  That is maladministration at its worst and is something we should all deprecate.  The shared ownership scheme would be ideal for a couple in the circumstances I have outlined or for other couples building houses.  The experience in the case in question has been a nightmare.  It illustrates a level of bureaucratic complexity which should not be tolerated in any modern society.  The manner in which the delays have been allowed is nothing short of appalling.  The pressure put on this young family is a scandal and is certainly unacceptable.  The whole process of buying a site, acquiring planning permission, building a house and negotiating with a contractor is in itself a daunting task for any young couple.  The long process of one difficulty emerging when another seems to be resolved, as happened in the case of the young couple I have referred to, is not acceptable.  It is an example of what happens when our administration gets too complex.  As I have said, the scheme is a good one.  I hope the Minister will be able to give me some solace in this matter when responding.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the issue of efficiency.  For a long time I have been arguing that, with the removal of responsibility for local taxation from the shoulders of local authority members, the whole issue of efficiency at local government level has been put on the back burner.  I have suggested from time to time that Ministers give consideration to the establishment of a mobile cost effectiveness unit which could be called in by local authority representatives.  The local authority representatives could leave the examination of estimates to this unit in the first instance and could act on suggestions from such a unit.  I hope the Minister will give some consideration to this matter.  I know that Deputy Kavanagh in <Col N="1530" /> my own local authority area has been calling for ways of tightening up in the spending of public taxpayers' money.  We should all be happy that this money is being spent efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin by deploring the way these Estimates debates are handled in this House, not by the Chair but by the reason of the Whipping system.  Deputies are constrained to ten minutes on Estimates that cover typically a fairly wide range of complex issues. This does not allow the House to have any real debate on the Estimates.  I note that even the Minister seemed to regret that he had such a short time to deal with a very wide-ranging Estimate.  This is an insult to the House.  The Whips should get together on the matter and reflect again on it.  On the last occasion I spoke on an Estimate in this House I was allowed ten minutes, as were other Deputies.  One can understand that I was a little browned off when I heard later that the debate had concluded at 3 p.m. that day instead of 4 p.m. The Whips should have a look at the way they organise these debates because it is unreal to debate complex issues as we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to go outside my own constituency, and indeed the constituencies of Deputy Roche and Deputy Cosgrave, and look at a more global constituency. I have been looking at this Estimate side by side with the declaration adopted with great pomp and ceremony last Sunday week in Rio de Janeiro after the UN conference and I am not impressed either by the declaration or by the Estimate.  I could say nothing more pertinent than what is reported to have been said by the Norwegian Prime Ministe, Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, in her summing up of the conference: "We owe the world to be frank about what we have achieved here in Rio &mdash; progress in many fields, too little progress in most fields and no progress at all in some fields&rdquo;.  That is a fair summing up of the Conference.  We in this House should have a look at what we, as well as other countries represented in Rio, signed or what was signed on our behalf by Heads <Col N="1531" /> of State.  I will be able to deal with only a few aspects of the matter but it might be enough to illustrate my belief that we have not begun to take the issues concerned seriously enough.</P>
    <P>I checked to see if the Taoiseach said anything in Rio de Janeiro that would give us grounds for feeling we have a moral position to give leadership on any of the issues involved, but much to my regret he said nothing in that regard.  He made a speech of passing banality which hit all the proper buttons &mdash; Fianna Fáil are good at hitting the buttons &mdash; but nothing will come of it.  Nor is there any indication in this Estimate that we are taking the matter seriously.  I am sceptical about the Minister's promise earlier that all these matters will be considered in the context of the review of the Environment Action Programme which will take place next autumn.  I will not hold my breath waiting for that programme because I do not see the foundation in this Estimate for doing anything particularly strong in that regard.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at some of the declarations that were signed, underlined and endorsed in our name in Rio.  I am referring to points in the agreement and the first that comes in mind reads as follows: "Environmental protection shall constitute an integral part of the development process.&rdquo;  Another point which seems to be related to that reads: "States should reduce and eliminate unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and promote appropriate demographic policies.&rdquo; Another reads: "States shall enact effective environmental legislation." I wonder where there is evidence in this Estimate that we are taking these matters seriously.</P>
    <P>On perusal of the Estimate I find that a total of £5,740,000 is being devoted to purposes which we could define as looking forward and planning for how we deal with the environment &mdash; a provision of £710,000 for the Environmental Protection Agency, provision of £1,650,000 for environmental and related services and a provision of £3,380,000. for research, analytical and related services. <Col N="1532" /> If I read the Estimate correctly, the latter seems to be the heading from which we will supply our local authorities with the resources and expertise needed to follow up on all the provisions solemnly passed in this House in the Environmental Protection Agency Act.  I see no great rush on our part to give real life to these three points from the Rio de Janeiro declaration which I just read.  To provide £710,000 for the Environmental Protection Agency in 1992, eight years before Agenda 21 is to come into effect, shows no great rush on our part to secure the objectives set out in the declaration.</P>
    <P>Another of the points reads: "In order to protect the environment the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities.&rdquo; Leaving aside the question of the typical cop-out conference language "according to their capabilities", which will no doubt be a fruitful arena for argument for many years to come, I do not see in our legislation a whole-hearted, red-blooded, gut busting commitment to the precautionary approach.  We had much debate about that matter in this House and I cannot say that I could hike off to Rio de Janeiro and tell the assembled Heads of State from around the world that Ireland is going bald-headed for this precautionary approach. I wonder if we and other countries are serious when we sign these declarations.</P>
    <P>I will come back again to the declaration on unsustainable patterns of production which reads: &ldquo;States should reduce and eliminate unsustainable patterms of production and consumption and promote appropriate demographic policies.&rdquo;  There were many arguments at the Conference as to what are appropriate demographic policies.  I do not intend to enter into the area of philosophical and theological debate between the Vatican and the rest but I cannot honestly say that I see great evidence of appropriate demographic policies.  We have not concluded on that issue, although I hear that the Minister for Health made promises again yesterday about the availability of condoms.</P>
    <P>I am much more interested, for the <Col N="1533" /> purposes of this debate, in what we are doing to eliminate unsustainable patterns of production and consumption.  What do I find?  The Government, and many of the interest groups in our society, are objecting to the European Community proposal for a resource tax.  That tax is intended to produce the funds required to begin to modify our production machines and our consumption patterns so that they will be less damaging to our environment. Our Government are hesitating about it as are all the major interest groups here.  I regret that the only friend the proposal seems to have here, in any half organised way, is the Geeen Party, although they cannot be taken seriously, especially after their performance in the Maastricht treaty debate.  The Conference solemnly adopted this as an objective in its declaration.  It is calculated that 712 million tonnes of carbon dioxide entered the atmosphere as a result of fossil fuel burning.  During that 12 days of the Conference 1.2 million new cars rolled off the world's production lines, the vast bulk of them in the already developed countries and a further 6,720 sq. kilometres of tropical rain forests were lost and, perhaps, $30 billion was spent on arms.  Can we take seriously the commitment of all those Heads of State and Governments who went off solemnly to sign that declaration?</P>
    <P>Another part of the declaration states:</P>
    <P>States shall co-operate in a spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the earth's ecosystem.  Developed countries acknowledge the responsibility that they bear in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command.</P>
    <P>However, the Conference was unable to arrive at any very solid agreement on the ODA programme.  The British seem to have managed to block putting a date on the achievement of the UN objective of 0.7 per cent of GNP for ODA.  Our performance in that regard has been abysmal. In this House a day or two ago the <Col N="1534" /> Taoiseach, who claimed in Rio that he had a plan for increasing our ODA activity, was unable to say what is involved in that plan or what he will do about it in 1993.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, having signed this declaration, is unable to tell us his plan.  I do not know if we can take that seriously.  There is the following statement in the declaration:</P>
      <P>States should effectively co-operate to discourage or prevent the relocation and transfer to other States of any activities and substances that cause severe environmental degradation or are found to be harmful to human health.</P>
      <P>The declaration continues:</P>
      <P>National authorities should endeavour to promote the internationalisation of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments, taking into account the approach that the polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution.</P>
      <P>Having read those two statements I find both Ireland and the UK convicted of utter insincerity, when I look at the Sellafield issue which clearly indicates that neither the UK nor Ireland takes either of those statements seriously.  Our stated ambition or undertaking to discourage or prevent the relocation of materials is baseless because we all know, although we would not say it, that we would not be able to reprocess spent nuclear material from this country if we did not have Sellafield. Both the UK and Ireland are indicted under the terms of the declaration they both signed.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I was sidetracked.  I congratulate the Minister for the Environment on his appointment. This is my first opportunity to meet him in the Chamber.  I wish the Minister well for the next few years.  He is from a rural area, which is a help, despite what Deputy Cosgrave said.  He is also a former member of a local authority but, above all, he is a good listener.  I hope he will be able to build on the good impression he has already created and will put his special stamp on the Department.</P>
      <P>There should be more money in this Estimate, but there are severe financial constraints.  The Minister referred to legislation such as the Housing Bill, 1992 and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill.  The Housing Bill is very important as has been mentioned by many Deputies but the points made by Deputies Roche and Cosgrave need to be clarified.  If necessary, the Minister should call in all county managers to ensure that anomolies will be sorted out so that the scenario Deputy Roche spoke about and of which Deputy Kavanagh is aware will not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the planning and development Bill, it is ludicrous that in the town of Ballina a project being prepared <Col N="1536" /> by the National Building Agency for a designated area has been objected to by the Department of the Marine.  The objection may have been dropped, but it should never have surfaced.  If a State body and a semi-State body cannot sort out their difficulties without a formal objection there is little hope for the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad that extra money, amounting to almost £27.5 million, has been provided for the national roads programme. However, in east Mayo little of it has been seen over the last number of years. No major work was undertaken in east Mayo under this programme.  The Swinford by-pass has been passed over and a national secondary road, the N57, which is the only artery to north Mayo and west Sligo has been ignored despite the fact that a section of that road carries the heaviest traffic in County Mayo.  As this road has all the qualifications for national primary status it should be upgraded and work should be done on it particularly at Cloongullaun Bridge and in Foxford. Will the Minister re-allocate the money that was supposed to go to Foxford town to finish a job that has been in progress for two years.  The money for that seemed to go to another part of the county.  The Foxford-Ballina Road is in a bad condition. A number of proposals for the road between Crossmolina and Moylough has been with the Department of the Environment for four or five years. The land has been purchased and it is very important that the work goes ahead immediately as this is a very important road.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of money is provided in the Estimate for water and sewerage schemes.  May I draw to the Minister's attention &mdash; although he may be aware of the problem being a former member of a local authority &mdash; the fact that when a large water or sewerage scheme is undertaken in an area, local people become very frustrated when very few locals are employed on the scheme. Indeed at present a major sewerage scheme is being undertaken in Swinford and I am told &mdash; indeed this has come up at local authority meetings &mdash; that only <Col N="1537" /> three people from the locality are employed on the scheme.  In the old days it was stipulated in the contract that the contractor had to employ as many local people as possible, especially unskilled labour.</P>
    <P>As a result of the resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Maastricht Treaty referendum, we can expect the Cohesion Fund to make a major impact in this country.  Many areas in my county, and indeed in my constituency, have not water and sewerage services.  While I understand that moneys from the Cohesion Fund cannot be used to fund new water supplies it can be used to upgrade existing water supplies which have been polluted over the years. Indeed Mayo County Council have submitted a number of proposals to the Department of the Environment for small sewerage schemes close to the River Moy.  The River Moy is a very important salmon fishing river but it is being polluted.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the rate support grant.  As Members may know, Mayo is the third largest county in the country but it has a small population and this places a great burden on the rate-payers. This difficulty could be addressed by an increase in the rate support grant.</P>
    <P>I have raised the issue of peripherality with the Minister.  There is very little point in complaining about our peripherality as an island nation on the edge of Europe if we ignore the peripheral regions in our own country.  Thankfully the present operational programme is coming to an end as we saw very little of this fund in the west.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have the opportunity to put his own imprint on Department policy over the next few years.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party will be opposing this Estimate.  The reasons are very obvious and we stated them during the recent debate on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992. We are particularly concerned about the number of local authority houses being built.  There is no need for me to go over old ground again in the limited time available and I will give three basic reasons why we are opposing this Estimate.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that the allocation for local authority and voluntary housing is over £78 million but studying the revised Estimates for the Public Service, one sees that the amount of money allocated by the Department for local authority housebuilding has been reduced by £1.5 million from £20,420,000 to £18,500,000.  It was the Minister's decision to make this change, thus reducing the allocation at a time when the number on the housing list is growing at an enormous rate.  Under the heading of housing stock owned by the local authorities the Minister has decided to reduce the allocation by £200,000.  We made a case for funds so that the people in those local authorities without bathrooms, could be given assistance to install bathrooms. Two million pounds was allocated last year but the figure remains the same in this year's Estimate.  Because of the rise in the cost of living, the allocation has less purchasing power; I think the figure is somewhere in the region of 3.5 per cent.  The Government have decided to provide less money this year for these three vital areas.  I cannot accept that and I made the arguments for increasing the allocation during the debate on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I would like the Minister to clarify but I dare say that he will not be able to do so today. The local authorities are supposed to find £32 million from their own capital receipts to make up the shortfall in the provision for local authority houses.  In my local authority this is not possible.  I understand the local authorities were <Col N="1539" /> able to raise money in 1988 by selling off local authority houses but we will never have a sale like that again.  The Minister seems to think that local authority housing can be provided from capital receipts but the money is just not there.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at the Minister's allegation of delays in completing local authority houses and he seems to be suggesting that the drop in the number of local authority houses is due to the tardiness of the local authorities.  I hope the Minister will send a letter to the chairmen of all the local authorities where this happened. We hold a housing meeting every month in Wicklow County Council and we have never had a report that the decrease in the number of local authority houses being built results from official delays.  The Minister should put the finger on those local authorities who are not doing their jobs.  It is only fair that he should be asked to make this known. If this can be shown to be the case in Wicklow, my colleagues, some of whom are Members of this House and one who is a member of the Seanad, would have something to say to our officials.</P>
    <P>I am a perfectly reasonable person and I accept that the Minister is entitled to some time to familiarise himself with the intricacies of this most interesting Department.  The provision for roads is most impressive.  Do the figures include grants from the Regional Fund?  Is this a gross figure?  Are EC moneys included in departmental Estimates?  I have been told in Brussels that Regional Fund moneys can be allocated for minor, non-national and non-secondary national roads if local authorities approach the Regional Fund Committee.  It would be helpful for all of us whose minor and secondary roads are not directly funded by the Department if we could look for support from the EC.  I was told it was possible but the Minister is allocating all the money to the Euro-route and national primary and national secondary roads. <Col N="1540" /> Perhaps he would tell us the exact position.</P>
    <P>The legislation on the protection of the environment is most welcome and we must wait to see how it works.  The presence of the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State at the recent conference in Rio de Janeiro has given hope that action will be taken and that the provisions of the Bill will be applied throughout the country.  It is important that this country be seen as a leader in this area.  We were fortunate in not having been an industrialised country and in having had a pleasant land handed to us.  Perhaps more people would be working if we had been an industrialised country.  Things are changing and there is need to keep a close watch on our environment.  I do not go as far as the Member who sometimes sits behind me and asks that we go around in open toe sandals and do not create employment through industrialisation.  We cannot provide jobs for young people if we do not attract industrial development but we must monitor that development and ensure that the planning and anti-pollution requirements are met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for affording me the opportunity to speak on an important issue which has arisen in the past few days as a consequence of a reduction in the road grant to Dublin County Council.  Lack of finance for the maintenance and provision of public lighting on some 29 miles of roads within the jurisdiction of the council has resulted in about 2,000 public lights being switched off in the Dublin County Council area.  Public lighting on the airport motorway, the Swords by-pass, the dual carriageway at Lissenhall near Swords, the Western Parkway, the Bray road and the Tallaght road has been disconnected. Lights on the Galway and Navan roads within the jurisdiction of County Dublin will be switched off by tomorrow.  This is a direct result of a reduction in the road <Col N="1541" /> grant to Dublin County Council.  It is a scandal which could lead to deaths on the road.  I urge the Minister to meet the officials of Dublin County Council and to ensure that the necessary finance is made available to maintain public lighting and ensure that people are not put at risk.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the announcement last night of an allocation of almost £500,000 for the upgrading of the Swords treatment plant.  I have been very much involved, with other Deputies from the area, in trying to secure this money.  I compliment the Minister on his decision and hope that the promise of last night will be fulfilled in the near future.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Calleary, Roche, Kelly, Kavanagh, Ryan, Dukes and Cosgrave for their very thoughtful contributions.  I may not agree with everything they said but they approached this Estimate in a fair-minded and open manner.  I consider their contributions to be very helpful and I regret I do not have sufficient time to deal with all the issues raised.  Their contributions contrasted very much with those of Deputy J. Mitchell and Deputy Allen.  We had a poverty-stricken <Col N="1543" /> performance from Deputy J. Mitchell in which he trotted out a maze of contradictions and shed crocodile tears but at no stage did he try to address the serious problems which this House and the country have to address in terms of meeting the needs and providing the services which fall to the remit of the Department of the Environment.  It was grasping for straws to see him frantically trying to gain some credit for the urban renewal scheme.  He must not have been in this country in the period 1987-89 when extensions were provided and when the Government provided the economic base and created the climate which encouraged people to be involved in developments of his kind of which we are all proud and for which I, and the Government, are glad to take credit.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that in the course of his contribution he sought to criticise the Ceann Comhairle and accuse him indirectly of collusion with the Department of the Environment.  He accused officials in my Department of telling lies and accused me of making a bland statement. Then he said he did not have time to deal with the issues in a 20 minute contribution.  He was able to use only 12 minutes of his time and then left this House, leaving the Fine Gael front bench empty for the duration of this debate on housing and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen, in his contribution, accused me of only having consideration for Dublin.  I dealt with the country in the brief time available to me.  I would remind him that £33.5 million has been spent on projects under the urban renewal scheme in Cork.  There is still time, until May, for new applications under the scheme.  We would welcome support from all sides of the House in helping to ensure that we have many practical and good schemes in every part of the country.  Much excellent work has been done resulting in many people living in circumstances and in parts of the cities <Col N="1544" /> which we neglected in the past.  We want those improvements to continue.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, Deputy Allen neglected to admit that I have approved, since coming to office, two major rehabilitation schemes, one in Mayfield and the other in Baker's Road; the completion of 60 houses in Douglas; the erection of 54 houses under the shared ownership housing scheme; 40 houses by Respond under the rental subsidy scheme and a further 120 units which will be provided by the voluntary housing sector. These are part and parcel of an integrated, new and dynamic housing approach by the Government.  Because it is new it will need support and there will be teething problems.  There is no point in going back to the sterile attitude of thinking we can solve the housing problems by major schemes on the periphery of our towns and cities without the necessary services and amenities.  I have emphasised on a number of occasions that I want to see local authorities produce imaginative schemes for derelict sites, inner cities and towns.  As all the attacks have been levelled at officials in my Department and myself I should like to state that a number of county councils have not been able to complete the number of houses for which they have approval.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple fact of the matter is that local elected representatives consider that the only way to solve this problem is to approach the Department of the Environment without looking to their own resources.  I will continue in the future to the best of my ability in Government to seek the maximum resources possible for this most deserving cause.  If all the new schemes are put in place up to 7,000 households will be catered for this year. That represents considerable progress on what has been achieved up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> Deputy Allen said that the main building societies have 170,000 mortgages outstanding and that the number of houses repossessed last year amounted to 100. In the case of local authorities the numbers are somewhat higher but not on a par with the situation in the UK.  Local authorities are in a position to make arrangements regarding the provision of alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche raised a point in regard to shared housing in County Wicklow.  I assure the Deputy I will try to make contact with the local authority to see to what extent that problem can be resolved.  I appreciate that any young family trying to provide for their housing needs, in the manner in which the couple he referred to have done, should not have to wait that length of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche referred to the Arklow by-pass.  The design work and environmental impact assessment on it is in the course of preparation.  Deputy Kelly raised the question of the Macroom by-pass. I am glad to say that the problem with regard to that route, following negotiations between Cork County Council and Macroom Urban District Council, has been resolved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the Earth Summit at Rio.  He dealt with the aspirational aspects and seemed to think that the only one aspect of our Estimate which dealt with matters of that kind referred to the Environmental Protection Agency and the provision for research.  He too will realise that the work we do in terms of providing water and sewerage schemes is part and parcel of the philosophy of the Government to deal with the environment. In regard to the directives, we have concluded more than 95 per cent of the transposition of directives from the European Community on the environment into law.  The environment is not all about what the Government do; it belongs to all of us; it is partly a response from industry, agriculture and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the matter <Col N="1546" /> of waste.  I appreciate the need for new strategies and new legislation which we are working on at present.  We have to consider recycling, re-use and the many different ways to approach this problem. In the long run there will still be need for land-fills but I will not get involved today in debating specific cases which are the subject of an environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <P>I regret I do not have time to respond to all the questions that have been raised. I thank Deputies who have contributed in a forthright, open and balanced manner. Due to time constraints I will reply to those queries I have not been able to answer in the House.  We can look forward to the type of progress I have outlined. In the context of making change I appeal to elected representatives to support initiatives at local authority level and compare what is happening in some areas with others.  They will find that excellent progress was made on a variety of schemes where a dynamic approach was adopted by the council supported by the local elected representatives.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of partnership I want to have, not only between my colleagues on all sides of this House but also with the councils throughout the country in trying to solve the problems as best we can.  The Government have never claimed to have all of the answers and we do not have all the resources we would like to have, but within the constraints that are there we seek, in a fair and balanced way, to do everything that we possibly can to solve problems and to bring together the range of options available, particularly in relation to housing, which is a fundamental area.  This Government will not be found wanting in doing everything possible to address those matters now and into the future.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Remedial Teacher for Dublin School.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that I am raising this issue at the same time as the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at the Department of Education are launching their long-awaited Green Paper on Education.  One might pose the question, what value have Green Papers when a primary school serving one of the most disadvantaged inner city areas in Dublin does not have and, it seems, cannot get a sanctioned remedial teacher?</P>
      <P>I refer to the 12-year long request for the sanctioning of a remedial teacher for Saint Paul's Christian Brothers' national school, North Brunswick Street, Dublin 7.  The school is best known throughout Ireland as &ldquo;Brunner&rdquo; or the original &ldquo;School around the corner&rdquo;, made famous by Paddy Crosbie.  Today Saint Paul's in Brunswick Street caters for approximately 300 children, many of whom come from some of the most disadvantaged parts of Dublin's north inner city.  Indeed, the school caters for the children of families living in a nearby corporation-funded hostel for homeless families.  Saint Paul's has one of the most committed and dedicated teaching staffs and parents' committees of any school in Dublin, or anywhere else for that matter. They are doing the very best they can for their pupils and their children despite the very limited resources available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now 12 years since the school first applied for the sanctioning of a remedial teacher.  There appears to be no explanation why the request has not been granted.  I suggest that this is the only national school in the inner city that does not have a sanctioned remedial teacher. Certainly, all of the other schools in the immediate environment of Brunswick Street have sanctioned remedial <Col N="1548" /> teachers, most have had those teachers for more than ten years.  The vast majority of pupils at Saint Paul's go to North Brunswick Street from schools with remedial teachers.</P>
    <P>So desperate is the obvious need at Saint Paul's that the school's concessionary teacher, given to them because they served a disadvantaged area, is trying to do the work of a remedial teacher.  However, because he is not sanctioned he is not trained, as the necessary training course at Saint Patrick's in Drumcondra is opened only when a teacher is sanctioned.  Equally, the grants for special books and equipment to furnish a remedial room are not available to Saint Paul's, again for the same reason.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has the slightest sympathy for the needs of this school he will at the very least ensure that they get the available grants and that the teacher gets the necessary training.  The officials in the Minister's Department are fully aware of the injustice of the case and the needs of the school.</P>
    <P>Out of the 240 pupils excluding sixth class there are 109 are in need of remedial attention in English reading and 92 are in need of remedial help in mathematics. The school are making every effort to cope with the serious difficulties of their pupils but there appears to be no reward for their efforts.  With 30 to 35 pupils in a class, their special needs &mdash; with the best will in the world &mdash; cannot be catered for properly.</P>
    <P>If the remedial teacher were sanctioned the post would not be counted for pupil-teacher ratio purposes, neither could the school lose the post.  The benefits to the pupils are very clear.  Surely the Minister will agree that it would be much better for society to assist Brunswick Street school in this way.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that it costs the State about £60,000 a year to keep just one young person in a detention centre or in prison.  How many young people would be saved from that fate if the <Col N="1549" /> proper resources were made available to our primary schools?  Children with serious learning difficulties in large classes consider themselves failures, and this frustration sows the seeds for future problems for our society, problems which are in the news every day of the week but whose causes or sources we fail to consider.</P>
    <P>Is it because St. Paul's is such a popular and successful school that they are denied the necessary resources?  Why is it that many other schools in more affluent areas in Dublin have sanctioned remedial teachers?  Were they chosen for political reasons?  They could hardly have been chosen on the basis of need.  There is no question of declining numbers at St. Paul's.  It is one of the best loved and most respected schools in Dublin city. The school's only difficulty is that they are attempting to do the very best for all their pupils.</P>
    <P>In support of their request they have submitted a detailed and confidential report to the Minister's Department.  I ask the Minister to examine the submission. He would then be in no doubt as to the urgency of the school's request.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that despite the commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there will not be a single remedial teacher sanctioned by the Department this year, just as none was appointed in 1989 or 1990.  Up until 1988 an average of 30 remedial teachers were sanctioned each year.  So much for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitment to direct resources to the disadvantaged. So much for the Green Paper being launched today.  I appeal to the Minister to review this matter urgently and to sanction a remedial teacher for this school, which needs one so badly.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan and the Minister of State, Deputy Liam Aylward.  I shall try to give the reply to Deputy Gregory.</P>
      <P>As has been indicated in the past to the House, remedial education at primary school level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachievement in primary schools.  It was with this in mind that 80 posts were allocated for remedial purposes out of the quota of posts made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for the school year 1991-92. These appointments were made following the collection of data and information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate.  The posts were then allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected.  There were applications from in excess of 800 schools for these posts and, in all, 242 schools benefited from the allocation.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 945 remedial teachers operating within the primary school sector.  Of the 3,235 ordinary national schools in the country approximately 1,400 have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or part-time basis.  At this stage, all primary schools in the country with enrolments above 420 pupils which sought a remedial service have at least one remedial teacher and many more smaller schools have the service on a shared basis.  It should, of course, be recognised that not all schools require, or indeed seek, the services of a remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of remedial teachers currently serving national schools in the Dublin area compares very favourably with the general level of provision.  Of <Col N="1551" /> the 413 ordinary national schools in Dublin city and county, 336 have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes 18 schools allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the national distribution under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Accordingly, in excess of 80 per cent of national schools in Dublin currently enjoy a remedial service.  The Minister would like me to point out that the school referred to by the Deputy already has the benefit of two additional concessionary teachers under the scheme for schools in disadvantaged areas and that the school has the option of deploying these teachers as it considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>The appointment of further remedial teachers will be kept under review and, in that connection, the Minister can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school referred to by him will be borne in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatLee" hpid="Dr. Lee Dr. Lee">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to highlight a vicious attack on the most vulnerable section of the community, our children, the future lifeblood of the country and tomorrow's citizens.  All general medical and surgical outpatients' clinics have been callously cancelled by the board of management of Temple Street Hospital for two weeks in July and two weeks in August.  In addition there will be a 10 per cent reduction of hospital beds for a period in excess of one month, all in the name of financial cutbacks in the area of child medi-care.  The Minister is responsible, as the buck stops with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I demand that the Minister for Health, a fellow general practitioner, should provide proper and adequate finance for the health care of our children on the north side of Dublin and stop this madness.  It is my duty, as an elected representative, <Col N="1552" /> as a concerned parent and as a practising family doctor, to point out that, as a result of this uncaring and unchristian attitude by the Minister, there will be a delay in early diagnosis and treatment of serious diseases which, as the Minister knows, is often vital in the prevention and treatment of children's disorders. Because of pressures on beds there will be early discharge of patients from overcrowded wards in Temple Street.  In many cases there will be early readmission of these patients for further treatment, as the community services, despite what the Minister's Department say, cannot and in many cases are not fully equipped to properly look after patients who were discharged early.</P>
    <P>There will be an increase in absenteeism from work as parents will have to take time off to look after sick children who have not fully recovered, physically or mentally, from the ordeal of investigations and treatment.  What price does the Minister put on the mental anguish of concerned parents?</P>
    <P>The casualty department of Temple Street is the busiest in Europe, catering for approximately 60,000 consultations per year.  It will come under further pressure because of these draconian measures. Sick children will be turned away and sent to other casualty departments on the south side of the city.  I should point out that Temple Street caters not only for the northside but also for the sick children of north County Dublin, County Meath, County Louth, County Westmeath, County Cavan and sometimes County Monaghan.  It has a catchment area of 300,000 to 400,000 children.</P>
    <P>The casualty department in Temple Street Hospital has an eight-bedded observation ward where patients are observed for a deterioration in their condition, for example, in relation to head injuries, asthma and epileptic attacks and acute abdominal pains.  In addition, from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. only one fully trained nurse and one student nurse are on duty in the casualty department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> These two overworked nurses must not alone look after the observation ward but also deal with routine casualty patients, which is an impossible and intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise to anybody for highlighting serious deficiencies and shortcomings in the area of child medi-care. Under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Coalition Government we have seen the evolution of a two-tier health system.  Those who can afford VHI can avail of high-tech, ultra-modern treatment but others are reduced to the status of second and third class citizens. If you do not have money you simply wait for treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I acknowledge the Deputy's right to raise this issue I am concerned at his alarmist statements.  The Deputy is being irresponsible in this regard because he is creating fear, concern and anxiety among the many families using the hospital.  As a medical doctor he must surely know &mdash; if he ever worked in a hospital &mdash; that there is always a rundown of services in every hospital at certain times of the year to enable staff to take holidays. However, I should like to reassure the public and set the record straight.</P>
      <P>The Children's Hospital, Temple Street, will close some of its out-patient clinics for the first two weeks in July and for the first two weeks in August of this year.  The hospital will also close 13 of its 136 beds for the summer period.  These relatively small restrictions are all seasonal and similar arrangements were made by the hospital last year and, indeed, in 1989.  The demand for beds is generally at its lowest during these summer months.  It certainly makes economic sense to restrict the service slightly during periods when the demand is at its lowest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that all emergency services provided by the hospital will be kept in place during the summer and, of course, the casualty <Col N="1554" /> department, which is normally open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, will remain open during the entire period. Cases which must be seen because of medical emergency will, of course, continue to be dealt with as part of the hospital's emergency service arrangements. I realise, of course, that the casualty department at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, is one of the busiest casualty departments in Ireland and treats approximately 57,000 patients per year.  This will not be affected at all.</P>
    <P>During the period January-May, casualty attendances have, in fact, risen from 21,264 in 1991 to 24,127 in the same period in 1992.</P>
    <P>The hospital authorities have informed me despite Deputy Lee's irresponsible statements, that the fracture clinics, the opthalmic clinics, the metabolic clinics and the oncology clinics will all remain open during the summer period.</P>
    <P>The activity undertaken by the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, has actually increased this year over the same period last year.  Total activity is up by 9 per cent, and this means that a total of 377 additional cases have been seen this year.  It is, therefore, quite untrue and irresponsible to talk in terms of a &ldquo;vicious attack&rdquo; on children.  I hope I have clarified the position sufficiently to show that a relatively minor reduction in services is all that has been made at the hospital.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Lee's remark that there are no community services available, I trust he is providing this medical service within the community and, if not, it is a damning indictment of himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I have had to bring the Minister back into the House on a day like today and that I have had to table this question, which was done with a great degree of anger.  We heard recently in Dublin Castle that if parliamentary questions had been tabled frankly and honestly in this House there would have been no necessity to establish the Beef Tribunal.  Yesterday a civil servant took it upon himself to unilaterally play around with the truth either at the behest of his superiors or, perhaps, his political masters.  I fear that something similar is happening in relation to national lottery funds.</P>
      <P>As a former office holder I should say to the Minister that he is above the pettiness which manifests itself in the way in which some of his smart alec officials have tried to evade responses to straight-forward questions.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question on national lottery funding which was more or less along the lines of this question but it was grouped with three other questions for answer last Tuesday, 22 June.  The Minister stated in his reply, &ldquo;I refer the Deputy to the replies to questions Nos. 87 of 26 February and No. 253 of 10 March&rdquo;.  The reply to Question No. 253 of 10 March refers to the reply to a grand total of 39 additional parliamentary questions. These replies evade, mislead or deliberately confuse or confound democratically elected politicians and were designed by civil servants acting on behalf of the Minister to stop us getting at the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no desire to have another tribunal at Dublin Castle to find out where the national lottery funds have gone but the one factural reply I got out of that network of camouflage and confusion was to Question No. 87 of 26 February in the name of Deputy Bradford.  It was a terse reply and it reads: &ldquo;there is no provision in my Department's vote for 1992 for new grant allocations under this <Col N="1556" /> scheme&rdquo;.  Yet, according to the Estimate £4 million has been provided under subhead F.3.  As recently as last week the Minister's Department wrote to every local authority stating there was no such scheme.  When I asked this question last week I was referred to the replies to other questions.  Either the Minister is trying to hide something or his officials are being far too clever by half.  This goes against the culture and traditions of the Custom House and I am sure it goes against the natural and personal instincts of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to answer three questions.  First, is there a national scheme whereby block grants are allocated to each local authority to enable them allocate money on the basis of subsidiarity to which only lipservice has been paid in recent times?  Second, how much money will be given to each local authority and, third, when will they be notified? If there is no such scheme in operation, in accordance with the reply to Question No. 87 on 26 February, why has £4 million been provided in the Estimates for 1992 under subhead F3?</P>
    <P>Finally, and I will allow the Minister extra time as I am more interested in his reply than in venting my anger, according to the findings of the survey carried out by DKM on the national lottery 52 per cent of those who participate regularly said that their motivation for participating in it was that organisations would benefit.  This is not taxpayer's money but rather money raised by the national lottery which was set up by a previous administration.  There is not one local authority around the country which knows what is going on in relation to these grants and the Minister's officials have come close to telling lies in the House in relation to the way parliamentary questions can be answered. That is the way one could reasonably describe it and still be in order within the rules of the House.</P>

I have not done so in this case, either, as I will illustrate presently, and this is why I take such grave personal exception to being accused of &ldquo;deliberate, constructed and sustained evasion&rdquo; and of &ldquo;evasion if not deceit&rdquo; in relation to the performance of one of my functions as Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>The Government's position on this matter has been made crystal clear in this House on several occasions.  If Deputy Quinn was not too busy shooting from the hip, he might have taken the trouble to consult the record of this House for 23 October 1991, 26 February 1992 and 10 March 1992 when parliamentary questions were answered on this topic &mdash; not to mention the reply I gave to his question as recently as Tuesday of this week. However, now that the issue has been raised again in this unfortunate manner, I will take the opportunity to once again set the record straight.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn referred this morning to the disappearance of national lottery funds.  There is no disappearance of lottery funds.  A sum of £4 million has been provided to meet payments to local authorities during the current year on foot of allocations made under this scheme in earlier years, according as work is carried out on individual projects and local authorities submit the necessary requests for payment to my Department.  There is no provision in my Department's Vote for 1992 for new grant allocations under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government made a conscious decision in their mid-year correction of <Col N="1558" /> the public finances last year to continue with this scheme in 1992.  That was a conscious and responsible decision on the national finances &mdash; the type of decision which, I hasten to add, the Government of which Deputy Quinn was a member shied away from in what I regard as a shameful dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the review of the Programme for Government 1989-93 states that &ldquo;in future, all amenity grants under the national lottery will be allocated by local authorities&rdquo; and that remains the position.  However, given that there is no new scheme for 1992, I have no intention of wasting time in deciding how a non-existent scheme might work; it should be clear to all Deputies that one cannot devolve something one has not got in the first place. The detailed arrangements to give effect to devolution will be decided by the Government at the appropriate time, and that will be whenever funds for a new scheme are made available.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to earlier schemes, I must make it clear that all the money provided has been allocated &mdash; the full list of the projects under the 1991 and earlier schemes which were allocated funds are in the Oireachtas Library.  In effect, the earlier schemes are finished and it only now remains for the grants that were allocated to be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The time is now ripe for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to inform the House what her views are in regard to the privatisation of Telecom Éireann.  It is essential that our citizens be publicly aware of whatever are the Minister's intentions in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An argument advanced in favour of public enterprise is that a purely commercial approach to the provision of some services would inhibit the initiation or continued provision of certain services of genuine social benefit.  A quite separate <Col N="1559" /> case for public ownership may exist in relation to services that are natural monopolies, for example, those that may utilise a distribution network, the duplication of which would be absurdly costly.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann are a special company, being Ireland's largest employer, the second largest investor in our economy and who, under public ownership, have been transformed into one of the leading telecommunications companies worldwide.  The present position of Telecom Éireann would be greatly endangered from the social and jobs aspects if they were privatised, particularly when one realises that their return to the Exchequer last year was of the order of £40 million.  Furthermore it is evident that Telecom Éireann services their own debt of a £1 billion loan and do not ask the State to provide any contribution. It is also clear that if privatisation of this company were allowed to proceed there would be grave fears for the continuation of the present rate of service to outlying areas nationwide.  It is evident that it would be those outlying areas that would suffer most as a result of the company's privatisation.  For example, I could not envisage circumstances in which an individual old age pensioner, living alone in a desolate rural area, would have a telephone installed for £120 if a private company were to operate the services of Telecom Éireann. It is very evident that if Telecom Éireann were privatised it would be the fat cats who would make all the gains, leaving ordinary citizens to endure all the losses and cutbacks.</P>
    <P>We have now in this country one of the most modern telecommunications networks worldwide consequent on the huge investment of public funds over the past ten years.  Indeed it is not unreasonable to contend that, in order to effect that investment, over that period our people went without other facilities, such as hospitals and schools.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is evident that the concept <Col N="1560" /> of privatisation over the past decade has been almost uncritically asserted by Government and public alike.  It is evident also that the staff of Telecom Éireann played a major part in the viability of the company, having made an enormous contribution to the present state of the company.  Experience in other countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, has demonstrated that privatisation brings heavy job losses, inferior conditions of employment, higher costs and inferior quality services for the public, especially for those in outlying rural areas.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann is important to us not merely for the services they provide, the profit they make, the 15,000 people they employ but also for its symbolic importance, in that it has been one of the few enterprises that has really worked here in recent years.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to be cautious and study the enormous difficulties that would arise for people in rural areas dependent on the diligent, trustworthy staff who at present provide them with a service second to none.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Sheehan that always I would act cautiously in these matters.  I might tell him that my predecessor informed the House on 5 November, 1991 and on 29 January, 1992 that the Government have given no formal consideration to the privatisation of Telecom Éireann and that no proposals were before Government regarding the company's future.  The present Minister repeated that statement in this House on 9 June.  The position regarding privatisation of Telecom Éireann has not changed since.</P>
      <P>As the privatisation of Telecom Éireann is not at issue the question of the effects of such change does not arise at this point.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann <Col N="1561" /> Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity of placing on the record of the House the vexed question of salmon netting on the River Moy by the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>First, I wish to apologise to the North Western Fisheries Board and the other agencies for my non-attendance at their presentation to the Minister for the Marine last evening of a plan for the management of the River Moy and its resources, occasioned by a pairing refusal on the part of my party.</P>
      <P>I might point out that the River Moy is the best salmon river in Europe, if not worldwide.  In that knowledge the residents of Ballina and surrounding areas are angry and frustrated at this action on the part of the Department of the Marine.  Tourists, the tourist industry and anglers in particular are astonished, angry and puzzled at the insensitivity of the action of the Department.</P>
      <P>I might first set the scene.  Ballina has been host to very many tourists and anglers in recent weeks when catches on the river were very small.  Fish were in the river, the water level of which was very low because of the good weather.  The House will understand people's frustration when, on Monday night-Tuesday morning, on the first haul by the Department of the Marine personnel, approximately 300 salmon were caught, with a further 400 alleged to have been caught during the day.  There is anger, frustration and puzzlement felt by those involved in the tourist and angling industries of the massacre that took place in that river.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say, first, on whose instructions the netting took place; second, what role the Department of Finance played in this matter and, third, whether he will now issue an order to stop the netting?  If he does, that unforgiveable action may be forgotten.  If not the ability of his Department to manage this tremendous asset will be further undermined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I attach great importance to the development of tourist angling on the River Moy system.  I recently received two reports about the Moy River, one from my Department and, only yesterday, a major development plan from the North Western Regional Fisheries Board, to which Deputy Calleary referred.  The Moy development plan envisages the creation of 300 new jobs centred on fisheries/tourism development and follows my request to each of the fisheries boards to submit firm proposals for the development of the river systems within their areas of responsibility.  Both reports place emphasis on the management and development of the Moy fishery, on an integrated basis, with a view to maximising its benefits for the local and national economies.</P>
      <P>Netting has been carried out on the Moy fishery for a long number of years. The scientific advice available to me is that it has not adversely affected the level of fish stocks.  This is kept under review in the light of the level of fish runs, water levels and so on.  This year the level of commercial fishing has been substantially curtailed.  In fact the commercial catch to the end of the third week in June was down from 5,200 to 2,500, or approximately 50 per cent.  As is customary, traps were not operated during the month of February to allow more spring fish up river and netting was suspended for three weeks this month at the height of the season.  This week, following a big increase in the salmon run, netting was resumed in the Polnamonagh station. However, the number of hours netting has been reduced from 24 to eight.</P>
      <P>I have ordered an urgent review of the planned levels of netting for the remainder of the season to ensure that whatever level is adopted achieves a proper balance between commercial, conservation, tourist and angling needs and the risks to spawning which could arise if the level of escapement up river should be excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Calleary asked who would take <Col N="1563" /> direct decisions.  I should say that the manager would be involved on the advice of the scientific staff, but, as I mentioned, decisions this year have been to reduce the catches and they have been substantially reduced.  As a result, the income is down accordingly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Calleary asked about the role of the Department of Finance in this. They have no direct role except that the Estimates passed in the House require a certain Appropriation-in-aid, and that will be down considerably now as a result of the easing off of the catches.  That <Col N="1564" /> could lead to a deficit of £40,000 to £50,000 by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the Deputy's concern.  I realise the seriousness of the whole question and that is why I asked for an integrated plan for the river so that we can reconsider the Estimates and say that on the basis of allowing more fish up the river there is a greater development in tourism; that will not be reflected in the Estimates here but in the broader creation of jobs, and I accept that.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 26 June 1992.</P>

    <P>Means testing as applied under such schemes is intended to ensure that available resources are directed towards those most in need.  Such means testing was intended for ESF support schemes to ensure that an increasing number of students from lower paid groups could be accommodated within the limit of resources available.</P>
    <P>In addition, as I have already announced, I am having the schemes reviewed with the following objectives:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The overall aim will be to ensure equity within and between the different schemes.  The review will include the removal of any outstanding barriers which may militate against students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    <P>&mdash;To the extent that it is practicable and affordable it will seek to address the particular financial pressures on students from the lower to middle-income families.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The review will, in particular;</P>
    <P>&mdash;re-examine the financial criteria for eligibility for student grants,</P>
    <P>&mdash;develop more equitable means assessment criteria.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the financial burden which school text books place on parents of schoolgoing children and in fact, one of the first steps which I took on my appointment was to request my Department to specifically examine this whole area and the ways in which that burden can be alleviated.  I am actively considering the engagement of a consultant towards this end.</P>
      <P>In an effort to alleviate this burden, my Department already have in operation a scheme of aid towards the cost of school books for needy pupils.  This now amounts to £4 million annually.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with this scheme my Department have advised management authorities to implement a school policy, including schemes for the loan of books, in co-operation with parents, which would ensure the efficient use of school books and minimise the cost for parents.</P>
      <P>My Department have, on a number of occasions, advised school authorities that selected textbooks should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. The syllabus planners, therefore, try to avoid over-frequent changes and are conscious that they should avoid any unnecessary increase in costs.  However, textbooks must be changed on occasion if teachers are to keep their work educationally stimulating and if content and methodology are to be kept reasonably up to date.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that the publication of school textbooks by the State would be generally acceptable in principle or that it would reduce costs significantly.</P>

      <P>My Department is providing £4,044,000 in 1992 for assistance towards the cost of school books for needy pupils in primary and post primary schools.  The relevant scheme is being revised at present in consultation with the partners in education with a view to having a revised scheme in place for the 1993-94 school year.  The aim is to ensure that the funds concerned are directed towards those pupils most in need of assistance and that the funds are distributed equitably between schools and within schools. Pending discussions with the partners I do not propose to comment further on the matter.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, schools have been informed of the details of the scheme which will operate for the 1992-93 school year.  This scheme is substantially the same as the scheme which operated in previous years.</P>

      <P>The present constitution of boards does not preclude the election of parents of travelling children to boards of management of primary schools.  At present, boards of management are representative of the patron, parents and staff.  Parent and staff representatives are elected democratically to boards in accordance with agreed procedures laid down for such elections.</P>
      <P>As is outlined in the introduction to the Green Paper I consider that there should be a decisive shift of responsibility for the day-to-day administration of schools from the Department to local level and boards of management should be representative of the owners or trustees, the parents, the teachers, the school principal, and the local business community.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 114, 115 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>A range of improvements in the Higher Education Grants Scheme is being introduced in the 1992 scheme for new entrants to third level this year.</P>
      <P>The principal improvements are:</P>
      <P>(a)  The income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education.</P>
      <P>(b)  Income eligibility will be assessed on current income and income limits in the year of entry into third level rather than as heretofore, on the income limits income in the year in which the student sat the Leaving Certificate.</P>
      <P>(c)  Mature Students who secure a place in a third-level institution will automatically be considered to meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>(d)  Mature Students may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes (and, if married, their spouses' incomes) rather than on their parents' income which has been the case up to now.</P>
      <P>(e)  Lone parent's welfare payments under the Lone Parent's Allowance Scheme will be excluded from the assessment of income for grant eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> (f)  Income limits and maintenance grants will be index-linked in 1992.</P>
    <P>The above improvements will only apply to students who will commence their third-level studies in Autumn 1992. Improvements made in the Higher Education Scheme apply only from the year of their introduction and have no retrospection.</P>
    <P>The criteria for eligibility for grants are being examined with a view to achieving greater equity and transparency in the context of an overall review of third level student support schemes undertaken by my Department.</P>

      <P>The special needs of Downs Syndrome children attending ordinary national schools are provided for in a number of ways.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, such children benefit from remedial tuition provided by the 945 remedial teachers operating within the primary school system.</P>
      <P>In addition, as part of the recent distribution of new teaching posts under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> six new special resource teachers were allocated to groups of schools which have handicapped children, including Downs Syndrome children, in ordinary classes.  The role of the resource teacher is to act in support of ordinary teaching staff in addressing the special needs of these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further development which is currently <Col N="1486" /> being pursued and which is relevant to the concerns to which the Deputy refers is the expansion of the visiting teacher service.</P>
    <P>Already, six additional teachers have been appointed to the visiting teacher service.  The intention is that these additional teachers, together with those of the existing service who currently focus on children with visual and hearing impairment, will form the basis for a generic service embracing other clinical groups.  Initially, it is intended that the expanded service will embrace children with Downs Syndrome as well as the visually and hearing impaired.</P>
    <P>This expanded service will continue to encompass the necessary level of specialist expertise to enable it to deal successfully with the range of disabilities involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The removal of internal frontiers within the Community will require the introduction of compensatory measures to combat serious crime and drug trafficking in member states and the development of common procedures for control at the external borders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much work has already been done to prepare for the removal of internal frontiers including, in the policing context, <Col N="1496" /> the adoption of a Programme of Action by the Trevi meeting of Ministers for Justice and the Interior of the European Community held in Dublin during the Irish Presidency in June, 1990.  That Programme of Action provides for the enhancement of police co-operation generally and includes specific measures designed to reinforce and build on existing co-operation in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, organised crime and illegal immigration.  Work on the implementation of this Programme and a consequent increase in co-operation in all these areas has since taken place.</P>
    <P>The decision taken by the European Council at Maastricht to establish a European Police Office (Europol), the initial function of which would be limited to organising the exchange of information on drugs among the Community's twelve member states, will further enhance police co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Gardaí will continue to maintain very close liaison with Interpol and with Police and Customs authorities throughout Europe.  This co-operation is vital to effective action against drug trafficking, terrorism and international organised crime.  There is also a need to develop and co-ordinate effective measures against drugs on an international level and this problem is being addressed at a number of fora in which this country is actively involved.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Europol Drugs Unit will be particularly important in the post 1992 context.  This unit will act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit for, in particular, drug-related information between member states.  It will be of great practical benefit to us in dealing with drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Intelligence gathering systems are well established in An Garda Síochána at both divisional and national level and are working very satisfactorily.  They are, of course, subject to constant review by the Commissioner and improvement as necessary.</P>
    <P>The patrolling of frontiers to counter smuggling is a matter primarily for the Customs authorities and accordingly falls <Col N="1497" /> within the sphere of responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Persons who have been on Disability Benefit for a year or longer, and who satisfy the medical condition of being permanently incapable are entitled to claim Invalidity Pension.</P>
      <P>A person in receipt of Deserted Wife's Benefit would not, therefore, normally be entitled to Invalidity Pension.

      <P>In the absence of specific details of the particular client it is not possible to say whether it is open to her to transfer to Invalidity Pension nor whether she would lose or gain by such a transfer.

The other person is receiving a Retirement Pension of £64 per week.  The aggregate of the two pensions is £140 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> The Deputy will note that, arising from recent decisions of the European Court of Justice, it has emerged that the temporary alleviation payments, which offset the effects of the equal treatment legislation, are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment and cannot be continued.  These alleviation payments are being discontinued therefore with effect from 30 July 1992, coinciding with the date of implementation of this year's budget increases.  However, many of the families affected by the discontinuance of these payments will be entitled to payments under retrospective legislation arising from the delay of the then Government in implementing the 1979 EC Directive on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security.  Accordingly, married women who were affected by this delay will have equal treatment arrangements applied to them retrospectively for a period between December 1984 and November 1986.  In 1992 £22 million has been provided for these extra payments which will be made on a phased basis between 1992 and 1994.</P>
    <P>In the case of one of the people referred to by the Deputy, the cessation of the temporary alleviation payment from 30 July will result in the loss of £12 a week.  However, this loss will be offset to some extent by budgetary increases of £2.60 per week in each of their pensions (total £5.20) payable from 31 July 1992. Therefore the couple will incur a net loss of £6.80 per week in total.  It is not known whether the couple concerned will benefit from the retrospective legislation, until the details in this case are fully assessed by my Department.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has recorded a total of 288 paid contributions and a total of 281 credited contributions (total 569) during the period from 1980 to 1992.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the Department's records which show that the person concerned entered insurable employment in 1980, she is likely to qualify for a Retirement Pension at the current rate of £62.40 per week on reaching age 65 in July 1992. She must satisfy the retirement condition of this scheme.  Alternatively, she is likely to qualify for an Old Age Contributory Pension at the same current rate on reaching age 66.</P>
      <P>An application form for Retirement Pension has been issued to the person concerned.  As soon as this is completed and returned to my Department, her entitlement to pension will be investigated. She will be notified of the outcome as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Section 127 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 provides that the Minister for Social Welfare may arrange for the issue of medical certificates free of charge to sickness benefit claimants.</P>
      <P>In accordance with this provision, arrangements apply under which qualified medical practitioners undertake to provide medical certificates of incapacity on request from insured persons who wish to claim disability benefit, injury benefit or maternity benefit.  One of the conditions of the undertaking which the practitioner is required to sign provides that the certifier shall medically examine a claimant for benefit and where he is satisfied that the claimant is so in-capacitated shall issue a certificate accordingly.</P>
      <P>The certifier is remunerated by my Department in respect of medical certicates issued by him.  Certifiers are prohibited under the terms of their undertakings from demanding or accepting cash or award for the issue of such a medical certificate and may only charge a fee to the claimant where medical advice and treatment is requested separately by the claimant.  In the case of claimants who are covered by the General Medical Services Scheme, the cost of examination is normally met by the health board.</P>
      <P>The agreement signed by medical certifiers sets out the method of calculation of payment for certificates issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, a total allocation is made each year which takes into account the total number of persons insured for Disability Benefit multiplied by a fixed capitation rate.  The resultant allocation is then distributed among certifiers by reference <Col N="1520" /> to the total of the medical certificates and similar forms issued by them. The payment made to the individual medical certifiers in respect of each certificate issued varies according to whether they reside in a city, town or rural area. Payment at double the normal rate is made in respect of special medical reports.</P>
