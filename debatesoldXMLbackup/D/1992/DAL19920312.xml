    <Title>Requests to Move Adjournment of Dáil under Standing Order 30.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil in accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 30 on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the immediate threat to 900 permanent jobs and 600 part-time jobs at United Meat Packers Ltd. at Ballyhaunis, Ballaghaderreen, Camolin and Charleville; the failure of the examiner yesterday to obtain the necessary finance from Irish banks to continue with and complete his examination of the company; the unwillingness of the Government to use their influence with the banks in order to advance the necessary £4 million for the completion of the examination; and the collective failure of the Government and the Irish banks to appreciate the devastating consequences to rural communities of the loss of the four factories and their subsidiary service industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the following matter of public interest which requires urgent attention, namely, the total and abject failure of the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food <Col N="682" /> to involve themselves in any meaningful way in the negotiations to save the UMP group of companies who provide 1,500 full-time and part-time jobs, export meat to an annual value in excess of £300 million and who are the mainstay employer in a region of the country distressed by endemic unemployment and emigration. This stand-off by the Government has allowed two leading Irish banks to withdraw from the rescue negotiations involving a loan of £4 million thus inflicting on the Irish meat processing industry, the cattle and sheep producers and the 1,500 unfortunate employees financial damage of countless millions of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the following matter: In view of the imminent failure of the attempts to rescue 900 jobs in United Meat Packers Ltd., this House demands a full statement from the Minister for Agriculture and Food as to the actions he is now proposing to take to secure the future viability of the meat plants which are now at immediate risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil in accordance with Standing Order 30 on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the impending appointment this morning of a receiver to United Meat Packers Ltd.; the loss of 900 full-time permanent jobs; the eclipse of the second largest meat processing group in the country which will greatly affect the competitive price for cattle and sheep at farm level; and the tremendous risk to farmers and other small creditors whose cheques have not been honoured up to this morning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important <Col N="683" /> matter of public interest, namely, the failure of the court-appointed examiner to secure the necessary finance from the banks to complete the proposed rescue package for United Meat Packers Ltd.; the failure of the Irish banks to act in a socially responsible manner; the consequent imminent threat to the jobs of more than 900 full-time employees and 600 part-time workers; the appalling consequences of such job losses in towns such as Ballyhaunis, Ballaghaderreen, Sligo, Banagher, Camolin, Charleville and their surrounding areas and the urgent necessity for Government intervention to secure the necessary finance to save the jobs.  In view of the importance of this matter I hope you will agree to the debate, Sir.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil pursuant to Standing Order 30 to discuss the following matter of major public importance, namely, the impending appointment of a receiver at UMP and the loss of 900 jobs, including 120 full-time jobs and 80 part-time jobs at the company's plant in Charleville, County Cork, which will be a devastating blow to the local community, wracked as it is by high unemployment and emigration. The closure will also bestow a virtual monopoly position on the Goodman organisation which will be disastrous for the beef industry and the agricultural community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to inform the House that I have received notice that statements on this matter will be made under Standing Order 41 at 1.40 p.m. today.  Accordingly, I cannot grant leave to move the motions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to dispute the validity or merits of your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to put it to you in all fairness and equity that four ten-minute statements today after 1.30 p.m. when the examiner has already gone before the High Court and the matter is a <i>fait accompli</i> is totally inadequate. Four ten-minute statements to <Col N="684" /> the House are not sufficient or acceptable at a time when 900 jobs are at stake, the livelihoods of 900 families are going to the wall&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of this House today to have statements at 1.40 p.m. is like saying prayers when the funeral is over, and the Chair knows that.  There is no point discussing the matter when the Receiver has been called in.  I am absolutely disgusted with the Taoiseach and the western Deputies who should all take the blame for this crisis as a result of which 900 full time jobs and 600 part time jobs may be lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

It is a major crisis and I suggest that the House immediately discuss the issue, as happened last Thursday when there was a problem for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I suggest that an open debate of three hours should take place to discuss the loss of these jobs.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 35:</P>
    <P>In page 12, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a motion is laid before either House of the Oireachtas proposing to annul any regulation made under the Act and is signed by not less than seven members of that House, the regulation shall stand annulled after the elapse of 10 sitting days unless that House has voted to approve the regulation.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 35 relates to the making of regulations and the need for this House where seven Members so request within ten sitting days, to approve the order making the regulations, before they can take effect.  The manner in which regulations are made and the need for Oireachtas reform, particularly reform in the way we do our business in this House, is a matter for wider reform of the Oireachtas.  We cannot do it in the context of this Bill.  If, as the case will be next summer, we are endeavouring, having established the Environmental Protection <Col N="700" /> Agency, to have devolved on them a number of powers by way of regulation, it would be very difficult if we had to wait for the return of the Dáil in the autumn in order to be able to approve the regulations before they could take effect.  Given the complexities of the matters covered in this Bill and the fact that it will fundamentally reorganise the way we deal with environmental protection, it is impossible to put every detail into the legislation.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to enable certain things to happen.  Regulations will be made in relation to many administrative and housekeeping matters.  They will be mere formalities as far as the House is concerned. As I said already, where formalities are concerned, we very often agree to them without any difficulty or debate, as we did yesterday morning in relation to four matters and as we did on Tuesday afternoon in relation to another matter.  This would be the case in the vask bulk of regulations to be made under the Bill when it is enacted.  However, it is important that a Minister does not have the power to make changes in the fundamentals of the Bill &mdash; the manner in which the director general and the directors are appointed, changes to the First and Second Schedules or other substantive matters. The Minister would have to get affirmative approval from the Houses of the Oireachtas before regulations in relation to changes of substantive matters could take effect.  I believe that is a satisfactory arrangement.  However, how we deal with the legislative process is a much wider issue.  My experience in general tells me that there is a better way to conduct business and I hope the parties in this House will be in a position, sooner rather than later, to initiate and then implement the kinds of reforms that will make the job of legislators far more meaningful.  There may then be a different way to deal with regulations and matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made some good suggestions in relation to a more effective committee system which would be involved in the legislative process in a meaningful way.  Yesterday I said I had <Col N="701" /> considered referring this Bill to a special committee of this House but when I considered the long passage of both the Child Care Bill and the Companies Bill by way of special committee, I quite honestly felt, given the way the committee system works at present, that this would lead to undue delay.  We have had already a long delay from the time the legislation was first mooted to the Committee Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I cannot accept this amendment.  I said also that I believe there is nothing special about seven Members &mdash; perhaps because of the position I am in &mdash; I am sure that Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Garland would say that six people can achieve a great deal, indeed one person can often achieve a great deal.  I do not see the need to keep the number at the figure that constitues a group for the purposes of business of this House.  Reluctantly, I am not in a position to accept the amendment. I believe it would lead to undue delay and would completely tie the hands of any Minister.  It would also mean that when enacting primary legislation and setting up a completely new body every tiny housekeeping matter would have to go into the primary legislation or you would have to wait for approval from the Houses of the Oireachtas before regulations could take effect.</P>

      <P>We have approached the implementation of this Bill in a fair way. Should many of the regulations need to be changed, or sections changed by regulation, this can only be done after the regulations have been approved by this House.  This will apply to the more fundamental and substantive measures that are important, such as the appointment of the Director General or directors or changes in the First Schedule which would give the agency either more or fewer activities to licence and changes in the Second Schedule.  I believe we have struck a fair balance in the way we will implement his Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for making regulations are most unsatisfactory. The Minister is quoted in a daily newspaper this morning as censuring me for daring to suggest that local authorities do not need new regulations to monitor emissions from incinerators under the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  The Minister had better get her act together because the local authorities are under the impression that they cannot monitor incinerators under the 1987 Act and they are not doing so.  It is unworthy of the Minister to stand up and chastise Members for suggesting that and to say that we are not in full command of our brief.  While legislation is being passed by this House, the necessary regulations are not being made subsequently and as a result the legislation is relatively meaningless. I would like the Minister to clarify the question of the control of emissions under the 1987 Air Pollution Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> In the case of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, the Minister will be relying heavily on subsequent regulations. The Minister had better clarify the powers and obligation that local authorities have.  She could do that in this House or by communicating directly with the local authorities setting out their powers, obligations and responsibilities to monitor air pollution emission from incinerators.</P>
    <P>Hospital incinerators are lethal because in practice they are not subject to any monitoring except by those who operate them.  By way of illustration, I will cite the Southern Health Board. Only last Monday week the Southern Health Board admitted that the incinerator operating in the Cork Regional Hospital does not have the capacity to deal with the volume of waste it is incinerating.  Disposable plastic syringes, Petra dishes, blood and saline bags are being fed to an incinerator that is not opeating efficiently and the emissions are being spewed out into the atmosphere in a residential area.  We were told that the incinerator is burning at 800ºC but there is no control or analysis of emissions.  The health board technical officer tried to say that one cannot monitor emissions from a hospital incinerator because of the high temperatures involved.  That is total rubbish, in the true sense of the word. He asserted that one cannot monitor the gas emissions from the flue because of the high temperatures.  We have to get our act together.  The incinerators are a cause of controversy not only in Cork but in Dublin and we need to tighten up the regulations in regard to them.  Instead of censuring me, the Minister should get her act together and ensure that the local authorities monitor these incinerators, if they do not have the power to do so, they should be so empowered under regulations.</P>
    <P>Have the local authorities the power to enter a premises, whether private or public, to install a device to monitor the gases emanating from the flue? Second, how do the local authorities monitor emissions other than sulphur dioxide and <Col N="704" /> carbon dioxide, because most local authorities do not have the technology to detect unburned hydrocarbons, dioxins, hydrochloric acid or hydrochloric gases? How can they do this, even if they have the power to do so?  I am not trying to make a political point, but people's health is being affected.  We can get hung up on the emissions from industrial plants, from the Merrell Dow and the Sandoz plants, but we forgot about the emissions from incinerators in residential areas which are spewing out unmonitored gases day after day without any controls being placed on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I made my case on amendments Nos. 35 and 37 yesterday.  The case is well made regarding the need to reform this House but we are doing very little to address it.  Regarding democratic accountability for actions taken by Ministers on foot of legislation, we need to insert clauses such as proposed in these two amendments.  The amendment in my name adopts the traditional approach by requiring orders to be laid before the House with the possibility of being annulled by the passing of a resolution within 21 sitting days.  It is often difficult for parties in Opposition to find parliamentary time to annul an order.  There is merit in the novel suggestion by Fine Gael Deputies and I indicated my support last night.  Notwithstanding the Minister's support for the notion of democratic reform and improving the mechanisms of this House, she is still not disposed to accept either of these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 as currently drafted is flawed. It does not even require resolutions to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. We will not necessarily be consulted in the vaguest of ways by the Department once this legislation is enacted.  If the Minister is unwilling or unable to accept amendment No. 35 or paragraph (b) of my amendment No. 37, would she at least accept paragraph (a) of that amendment, which would require orders made under the Act to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as possible?  That surely is the very minimum democratic accountability that we would expect from <Col N="705" /> the Minister.  I would hope that she would go considerably further and if either of the mechanisms proposed is unworkable she might come back on Report Stage with another mechanism deemed to be workable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin's request regarding subsection (4) (a) of amendment No. 37 seems reasonable and I will come back to that on Report Stage.  I accept that it is impossible to annul regulations or orders.  That is our own fault because it is due to our procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedures make it virtually impossible to annul orders or regulations.  This is a wider issue for parliamentary reform.</P>
      <P>I am accused of chastising Deputy Allen.  I do not intend to chastise anybody and if I gave that impression I apologise. I was seeking yesterday to correct him and I suggest that there is a difference between correcting and chastising.  I acknowledge that the situation regarding hospital incinerators throughout the country is very unsatisfactory.  The Environmental Protection Agency are to be the monitoring, licensing and enforcing authority for hospital incinerators. They will be the appropriate body to ensure that these incinerators are operated to the highest standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the absence of this Bill, local authorities have substantial powers.  I referred to such powers yesterday. Section 54 of the Air Pollution Act states that a local authority may carry out or cause to be carried out such monitoring of (a) air quality and (b) the nature, extent and effects of emissions as the local authority may consider necessary for the performance of their functions under the Act or as they may be directed by the Minister to carry out.  I have been reading reports regarding Cork, noting the words in the Act &ldquo;or as they may be directed by the Minister to carry out.&rdquo;  I have had some preliminary discussions <Col N="706" /> about the publicity this matter received recently and I intend to discuss it further in the light of what has been said by Deputy Allen.  If there is a misinterpretation on the part of some, we will be willing to give assistance and advice if necessary.</P>
    <P>The hospital position will not be satisfactorily resolved until the Environmental Protection Agency is in place. The people in the agency will have the expertise, equipment and power to licence these operations.  I accept that the position is most unsatisfactory throughout the country and that hospitals must be above reproach in these matters.  It would not be a good advertisement for any hospital to be a source of pollution. I hope that when the Bill is enacted and the licensing powers are given to the agency the difficulties we have been experiencing will end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very clear that the Minister is not in command of her brief. This was evident yesterday in relation to hospital incinerators and today it is shown in her response to our amendment. She said that if she were to adopt our amendment it would make the Minister powerless.  That is not the case.  She went on to say that the fault lay not in the regulations but in the procedures of this House.  The very point of the amendment is to get over the deficiencies in our procedures.  Almost every Bill contains provision for this 21-day regulation procedure which provides that any regulation made by a Minister is valid unless annulled by resolution of the House within 21 sitting days.  On every occasion I can recall where a Member has sought to put down an annulling resolution, the Government have refused time to take it within 21 sitting days.  I suspect that if this procedure were tested in the Supreme Court it would be found unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are offering the Minister an opportunity to get over the problem in regard to these 21-day regulations by providing that where a motion is put down within ten sitting days by seven Members, that motion must be discussed.  Seven <Col N="707" /> being the minimum number for a group, that would avoid individuals tabling vexatious annulling resolutions.  This was clearly intended when the legislative procedure was introduced many decades ago.  It would not make it impossible for the Minister to act.  Regardless of a subsequent annulling motion, anything done under the regulation would be valid for the period of its validity.  If the Minister says otherwise, either she is not in command of her brief or she is misleading the House.  I do not believe she is intentionally misleading the House.  I am sick and tired enacting legislation which is subsequently ignored by Government and not put into effect.  It is almost the accepted procedure for us to enact legislation but fail to make provision to enforce it.  That is bringing the legislative procedure into disrepute.  It is happening right across the board.  Every aspect of legislation in this House can be criticised on the basis that we make inadequate provision for its enforcement or for calling Ministers to account for their deeds or omissions.  The amendment in the names of Deputies Allen, Carey and myself will call the Minister to account for her actions &mdash; we still have no way of calling her to account for her omissions but at least we could, under this procedure, call her to account for her actions in relation to regulations.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry the debate on this section is again being interrupted because of the urgency of other business. I intend to drive home the importance I attach to this amendment by forcing a division on it.  I regret the Minister of State is not in a position to accept the amendment.  I regret she does not see the validity of the amendment in affecting the reform of the procedures of this House which she has recently criticised.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one other point in relation to this amendment which concerns the roles given to local authorities under the regulations when they do not have the technology to undertake the monitoring role to be allocated to them. This is obviously another case of legislation <Col N="708" /> in a vacuum and not really providing any true enforcing powers.</P>

      <P>United Meat Packers began their operations in Ireland in 1974 when the chairman of the group Mr. Sher Mohammed Rafique purchased a slaughterhouse in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo.  Since then, the company have expanded to their present size which comprises some five export approved plants slaughtering cattle and sheep.  The factories are located at Ballyhaunis, Charleville, Ballaghaderreen, Sligo and Camolin, County Wexford.  All of the factories <Col N="709" /> slaughter cattle except that at Camolin which slaughters sheep only.  The plant at Ballyhaunis, which is the largest of the group, processes both cattle and sheep. The company also operate a cold store at Banagher, County Offaly.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the UMP group accounted for 14.5 per cent of total cattle and some 24.5 per cent of total sheep slaughtered at Irish meat export plants.  It is the second largest meat processor in the country after the Anglo-Irish Beef Processors group and have an annual turnover approaching £250 million.  The group also have holdings in both Britain and the Netherlands and total turnover, including the UK and European companies amounts to approximately £450 million.</P>

      <P>They are being provided. The Irish operations are understood to be structured separately for both the UK and continental holdings while an examiner was appointed to the Irish subsidiaries only.  I understand that the group employ about 700 people full-time. This figure would increase during the peak killing season.</P>
      <P>The group have been rumoured to have been in financial difficulty for some time.  It appears that this necessitated a re-organisation of the group's debt structure following discussions with their main bankers, a syndicate of seven banks led by Banque Nationale de Paris.</P>
      <P>The fire at the Ballaghaderreen plant in January 1992, which is estimated to have cost the group some £15 million, led to the immediate crisis.  Short-term credit facilities of some £15 million were arranged to help the group survive in the aftermath of the fire.  When repayments on these loans became overdue, Mr. Des Guilfoyle was appointed examiner to the group by the High Court on 17 February last, with permission to borrow £3 million. On 2 March 1992 he was given permission for further borrowings of up to £4 million, having previously successfully borrowed the £3 million figure.</P>

This was to facilitate him in endeavouring to overcome substantial difficulties he had encountered in arranging a financial package to enable him to continue to operate the group while he prepared a report for the High Court on their viability.  Intensive negotiations have taken place since Monday between Mr. Guilfoyle and the three banks involved, BNP, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, which ended late yesterday afternoon having failed to find a solution whereby the funding could be provided.</P>
    <P>The Irish banks refused to put forward moneys because they have the strongest reservations about the prospects of a positive outcome for the examinership. They believe if moneys were put forward now they would simply delay an inevitable complete overhaul of the UMP operation.  Under intense pressure from Government members the two main banks &mdash; Bank of Ireland and AIB &mdash; came together with the examiner.  They agreed, under certain conditions, to provide £4 million but it was on the strict condition that this money would have to be repaid at the end of the examinership. They made it abundantly clear that they did not wish to be involved in the UMP operation on a long term basis.  The examiner could not satisfy this condition as he could not guarantee that the money would be available at the end of his examinership.</P>

      <P>Alternative proposals for super preferential status were rejected by the banks.  The Minister for Finance contacted the president of BNP in Paris to ask the bank to reconsider their decision not to advance further moneys but the Minister's request was turned down.  As late as this morning my colleague, the Minister for Finance, had a further meeting with top executives of the two main Irish banks.  The Minister impressed upon them the concern of the Government that they should act in the <Col N="711" /> national interest in protecting jobs and in assisting an industry of vital national importance which has excellent prospects in the longer term.  The banks have responded in a very positive manner and they have indicated unequivocally their wish to act immediately and constructively in finding the best possible solution to the present crisis.</P>

The Irish banks believe that the only constructive way forward is to remove the very large burden of debt on this company.

      <P>I very much welcome the positive response that has come from the Irish banks this morning.  I welcome, in particular, their support for continuing operations in the west.  I am confident that BNP, the main creditor, will also respond positively so that jobs can be protected and a strong and viable industry will emerge from the receivership.</P>
      <P>There have been some inaccurate and mischievous comments in relation to the Goodman Group.  There have been claims that the Government treated UMP differently and less generously than the Goodman Group when they got into financial difficulties in August 1990. According to a report in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> this morning the Government provided £550 million to the Goodman Group.  I wish to put the record straight on this once and for all.  The Government gave no money, not one penny, to rescue the Goodman Group.  What the Government did was recall the Dáil to speed up the enactment of legislation, which had been close to finality in any event, to allow an Examiner to be appointed to the group.  It was this same legislation that was used to appoint an Examiner to UMP.</P>
      <P>Once the Examiner was appointed to the Goodman Group no further action was taken by the Government, unlike the UMP case continuing discussions during the past week involving Ministers, officials and the banks.  If some Members put as much effort into this matter as they put into trying to stir up hysteria, perhaps we could proceed a little further.</P>

      <P>Given the size of the company's liabilities a constructive receivership is the best method of ensuring that <Col N="713" /> the plants will continue in operation and the jobs will be protected.  There is every reason to believe that the plants will be bought from the Receiver.  On the basis, they would commence operations free of the large debt which has encumbered UMP.  That is the key to this issue; we have to free the company from this large over hanging debt.  Given the inherent profitability in slaughtering cattle and sheep I have no doubt that the plants will be sold and will operate profitably.  As I mentioned, the banks have given undertakings that they will be willing to fund the purchase and ongoing operations of the plants concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to dispel any notion that we, on this side of the House, are trying to make political capital out of this potentially tragic situation.  As you asked initially, I hope the debate will be conducted in a constructive manner.  That is what I intend to do.  We are dealing with the livelihoods of at least 900 families, and probably 1,500, who are directly involved in these four processing plants together with the two depots.</P>
      <P>The impact further afield on those two communities, and ancillary industries, will probably affect not just 1,500 people and families but thousands, if not tens of thousands of families.  If the company are allowed to collapse many other businesses in those localities, Ballaghaderreen, Ballyhaunis, Camolin or Charleville, will find themselves in serious financial difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton was quite correct to ask the question of what will happen to those farmers who have cheques from this company which will not be cashed.  I believe there are cheques out to the extent of £4.5 million.  This means that many farmers will find themselves in serious financial difficulties.  Likewise, I understand that creditors, that is small businesses and perhaps larger businesses, in the <Col N="715" /> localities concerned are owed in the region of between £6 million and £7 million. Again, it will be a tragedy for those communities if this group close.  These points should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>We are speaking here about the second largest processor in the largest indigenous industry here.  It is ironic at this time, when we are spending so much of our time in the Dáil debating a jobs forum that we are now overseeing the collapse of the second largest company in the largest industry in the country.  Let us cast our minds back and remind ourselves that the largest company in the beef industry, the Goodman Group, which was supported to the extent of £550 million, albeit through the financial institutions, are living on sufferance.  What we are seeking is the continuation of this company, United Meat Packers, be they known as Halal-United Meat Packers or whatever; we want to see the company continue in their entirety and the jobs in question retained.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister referred to debts of £50 million.  I dare say there are many companies with debts of £50 million if they were to go into liquidation in the morning.  There are very few companies with assets on hand to offset their liabilities.  From my recollection, companies such as this when they go into receivership are asset-stripped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be of help if the Taoiseach and others listened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This means that jobs will be lost hand over fist.  The plants at Camolin and Charleville are modern and stand a good chance of continuing, even when a Receiver is appointed, but the bulk of the jobs are in the west, in Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen and they are not so well structured.  The concern of Deputies from the west hinges on that fact.  Will those factories at Ballaghaderreen and Ballyhaunis continue in existence if the company go into receivership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the question confronting us today and my objective view is that they <Col N="716" /> will not unless action is taken by State agencies in conjunction with the financial institutions here.  We do not expect the banks to take unilateral action in coming together to formulate a financial package to save this group.  However, we expect a Government initiative in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority and the financial institutions to ensure that the plants continue to operate at maximum capacity because once they close, and I am referring in particular to the two plants in the west, they may never re-open.  We cannot afford to lose that number of jobs in deprived areas.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Taoiseach who is in the Chamber, and to the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance that they must oversee the financial restructuring of this group, be it under different ownership or management, because they must continue.  Not alone have this group provided valuable employment but their activities are highly praiseworthy because the bulk of the beef and lamb they kill does not go into intervention.  They are not a drain on the European or Irish taxpayer, they sell on the open market in Ireland, more often in Britain and the Continent.  They are a decided asset to the agricultural community, the Exchequer and the nation.  They cannot be let go down the drain; those plants will be locked and the chances are that those in the west may never reopen.  It will be a case of asset stripping, which is all that financial institutions are interested in when a receiver has been put in, and we are aware that this was the case this morning.  I am also aware that the company have appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.  Why did the examiner, in conjunction with State agencies, not continue his examination until the time schedule had elapsed?  The time schedule should not have elapsed until next Monday morning.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Members on the Government benches of similar rescue operations.  I will not refer to the Taoiseach's company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland owned by Allied Irish Banks.  When we were in Government in the mid-eighties that company collapsed with huge liabilities potentially running into billions of pounds.  We as the Government of the day underwrote those AIB liabilities to the extent of £300 million to £400 million. Fortunately, the company were able to trade themselves out of their financial difficulties.  I believe that United Meat Packers can do likewise if they are given the opportunity by the Government. However, it must be a Government initiative.  The Associated Banks, including the AIB, who have a huge debt to repay to the State, have reneged on taking a positive stance on this issue. They are allowing many farmers to suffer financial ruin and allowing numerous industries to go to the wall in conjunction with the Halal United Meat Packers Company.</P>
      <P>We are prepared to be helpful and constructive but we expect Government action.  The people, especially those in the west, also expect action from the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that a deep crisis surrounds the immediate future of the UMP group of companies. That crisis will affect 1,500 families in the most direct possible way.  It will affect every single farmer who is owed money by the company, or who relies on the company as an outlet for product.  It will affect the banks, the downstream suppliers, and the local economies of the towns and hinterlands in which these plants are located.</P>
      <P>Above all, it will have a devastating effect on local communities.  Many of the communities involved, especially in the west, have struggled against the odds for years, often in the face of Government neglect.  The blow to hope and to morale which would be caused by the total collapse of these companies would take years to recover from.  Already, there must be families in the west who are yet again contemplating the prospect of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> It gives me no pleasure to say this situation was largely predicted when the Dáil was recalled in August 1990.  In the speech he made on that occasion, the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring, called for a &ldquo;detailed, root and branch, analysis of the medium-term and long term situation facing the industry.&rdquo; He went on to say: &ldquo;The Government must accept the bounden obligation of drawing up a plan for the industry, based on the principle that no more monopolies will be allowed to be developed, and taking into account the need to develop new markets based on the excellence of the product and the quality of production.&rdquo; He concluded that speech by saying: &ldquo;what is crucial here is that we recognise now that the beef industry cannot be allowed to struggle from crisis to crisis.  I call on the Taoiseach now to ensure that once this short term situation has been resolved, the necessary steps will be taken to place our beef industry on a sound footing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was plain to see even then that the crisis which had overtaken the Goodman Company &mdash; whatever its causes, and this is not the place to go into them &mdash; was certain to have repercussions throughout the industry.  It was clear that the failure of the State to address the need for a co-ordinated approach to the development of the food industry would have repercussions. It was clear that the failure to recognise the over-dependence of the industry generally on intervention and its failure to develop and diversify into value-added areas would have repercussions.</P>
    <P>In this sense, the Government must take a large measure of responsibility for what has happened in relation to UMP. The Government have turned a blind eye to the ramshackle way in which too much of the food industry is run.  They have concentrated on crisis management rather than on development.  They have preferred to sell off powerful productive assets like the Sugar Company rather than to use those assets as the focus of a properly planned and co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is not particularly productive <Col N="719" /> for us to say that the Government are the only body responsible for the crisis facing UMP.  It is my understanding that a figure of £40 million, which has been quoted by many sources as being the amount needed to put this company back on a sound footing, is in fact only part of the problem.  I am told that £40 million may in fact be a more accurate reflection of the gap between the assets and the liabilities of this company.</P>

      <P>We do not know &mdash; and we have not been told by the Minister &mdash;what the financial situation of the company is.  I was referring to what I understand it to be.</P>
      <P>Serious question marks must, therefore, be raised about the management of this company.  It is impossible to arrive at a situation where a company is effectively trading insolvently, to the extent that this company seems to be, without at least the suspicion that cavalier mismanagement is involved.  I have been told, for example, that in recent days substantial amounts of cash have been transferred out of this jurisdiction by senior people in this company. I sincerely hope that my information in this matter is incorrect, and I will be very grateful if the Minister is in a position to confirm that nothing like this has happened.</P>
      <P>The bottom line has to be that we cannot turn our backs on the communities dependent on the jobs and cash flow generated by this branch of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last ten years, this country has faced a number of crises similar to this one, and in every single case that I can think of, it has fallen to the Government, as it must in this case, to spearhead a response.  We do not need to concentrate <Col N="720" /> simply on the Goodman affair to find a precedent for action.  Although it is clear that the Government reacted in enormous haste when a crisis developed in the Goodman Company, it is doubtful, to say the least, if the action taken then was enough, in terms of its character, to protect the long term future of the food industry.  However, in the past, Governments effectively rescued the banks from the consequences of the ICI affair, through a combination of actions which were ultimately successful although they entailed certain risks at the time.  When Dublin Gas was faced with a similar crisis, Government action ultimately proved effective as well.  Perhaps the outstanding precedent to which we should point was the rescue of the PMPA through action co-ordinated by the late Frank Cluskey.  That rescue was effected in the first instance by the appointment of an administrator, under legislation which is still on the Statute Books, and through the investment in the company of resources raised through a relatively modest levy on insurance premia.  The company when returned to a sound financial basis were returned to the private sector and they continue to operate on an effective basis today.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will support any action now proposed by the Government to adopt a similar procedure in this case, but we will not support any attempt by the Government to wash their hands of responsibility or claim that this is a matter which must be left to market forces to resolve.  The Government have a bounden obligation to act to preserve the crucial nucleus of this enterprise and to protect as many of the jobs as possible. It is often said in agri-business circles that whenever a vacuum is allowed to be created, somebody moves in.  I have not the slightest doubt that attempts will be made by people whose monopolistic ambitions are well known to move in on UMP.  The Government should resist all such efforts in the interests of the ultimate protection of the jobs involved.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to make a point about the banks.  The Minister has referred to the conditionality attached to offers <Col N="721" /> made so far by the banks.  The banks should be called in now by the Government and told categorically that such conditionality is simply not acceptable. Whether they like it or not the banks have a social and national responsibility in this matter.  Despite what the Minister has just told the House, we know from our experience that the banks will see no responsibility other than to their profits and their shareholders.  Whatever pressure it takes now, the banks must be forced to take a measure of responsibility for the rescue which is essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of a receiver or liquidator to United Meat Packers Ltd. following the failure of the examiner's rescue attempts is an appalling prospect for the 900 full-time workers, 600 seasonal workers and thousands of suppliers.  It will also be a tragedy for all the towns where the plants are located &mdash; Ballyhaunis, Ballaghaderreen, Sligo, Banagher, Camolin and Charleville &mdash; and the surrounding areas. There was a steady build-up of employment in the plant in Charleville, which is in the heart of the Golden Vale, and a number of young people were recently employed there.  It is difficult to understand why this industry cannot be made viable.  The Minister needs to look seriously at the entire industry at a time when jobs are so badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the closure of United Meat Packers Limited goes ahead it will be a crippling blow particularly to Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen where most of the jobs are located.  It will take these towns years to recover from this blow, if indeed they ever recover.  The closure of this company will mean that the amount of money coming into these areas will be greatly cut and every business and service will suffer, with the almost certain consequent loss of yet more jobs.  Not one family will be unaffected by the closure. Many of the jobs will be lost in areas where there is no alternative employment. Even the traditional outlet of emigration has been greatly restricted by the recession in the UK.  The only option for many people will be to emigrate when <Col N="722" /> the opportunities again become available.</P>
    <P>The loss of these jobs will be very considerable to the Exchequer.  It has been estimated that the cost of every job lost is approximately £13,000 in terms of tax and PRSI foregone and extra social welfare payments.  This would represent approximately £11.7 million for the 900 UMP workers.  When the losses from the seasonal workers are taken into account the total would be approximately £15 million.  Added to this will be indirect losses to the State in terms of lower VAT returns arising from the reduced purchasing power of people who will lose their jobs, extra health costs, supplementary payments and so on.</P>
    <P>Last year the companies supported by the Industrial Development Authority created 12,439 jobs on a budget of approximately £140 million.  On this basis the cost to the IDA of replacing the 900 full-time jobs alone would be over £10 million.  The more one looks at the figures, the more inexplicable is the Government's failure to take any action on this matter.  Given the scale of the potential job losses and social devastation, the reluctance is impossible to understand.  The contrast between the way the Government are sitting on their hands in regard to the affair and their &ldquo;no efforts spared&rdquo; response to the Goodman crisis is startling.  In August 1990 at the height of the summer recess the Dáil was recalled to deal with the Goodman crisis and emergency legislation was rushed through in two days.  All UMP and their workers merit in Fianna Fail's order of priorities is a two and a half hour debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister's indifference to this issue is astonishing.  He played a major role in the Goodman development plan in 1987. On that occasion the Government were apparently prepared to commit more than £60 million in IDA and FEOGA supports, not to mention the organisation of section 84 loans of approximately £70 million, on a plan which, at its most optimistic, was supposed to create approximately 660 jobs.  Yet on this occasion the same Minister seems unwilling to commit <Col N="723" /> even a fraction of this money to save these 900 full-time and 600 seasonal jobs.</P>
    <P>The banks must not be allowed to evade their responsibilities for this debacle.  Once again they have shown a total absence of any sense of social responsibility.  They are quick to dish out money and take their generous profits when times are good but when faced with the social devastation which the closure of UMP would cause they simply put down the shutters and locked the tills. This is not the first time the banks will have taken their pound of flesh at the expense of workers.  The banks probably cannot be compelled to provide money if they are unwilling to do so but the Government can ensure that they pay a heavy price for their anti-social attitude through the imposition of extra taxes or levies.</P>
    <P>Clearly, UMP's only hope of survival now rests on Government intervention of some sort.  The scale of the potential job losses is so great that the Government must act.  There is little point concentrating on meeting limited job creation targets if the Government sit back and allow actual jobs in an indigenous industry to disappear because of short term financial problems.  There is also little point in establishing an elaborate jobs forum if jobs on this scale are allowed to go to the wall.  The saving of these jobs must now be the absolute priority.  When this is done the other questions can be addressed.</P>
    <P>United Meat Packers have many questions to answer.  They are one of the most secretive companies in the country and little reliable information is available about the extent of their indebtedness or the manner in which these debts were allowed to arise.  Have the debts arisen through their Irish operations or through plants abroad?  To what extent did the fire at Ballaghaderreen contribute to the disaster?  The UMP disaster emphasises the urgent need for the more effective disclosure of company information.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene in this important issue so that these jobs can be saved.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice of concern in regard to the crisis that has occurred in United Meat Packers.  The loss of employment will be a major blow to the whole country, particularly to the west.  I visited the plant in Ballaghaderreen in mid-December 1991 and met Mr. Sean Clarke.  I was very impressed with the factory, where there is a staff of over 250 people.  That factory supply directly to the main supermarkets in Britain and to the major markets in Europe.  I briefed the company on the potential of the opening of the Iranian market, in which I was directly involved as Minister with responsibility for trade and marketing at that time.  I visited Tehran and had negotiations with the Government in relation to the opening of the beef market there.  I felt confident that United Meat Packers, with their contacts throughout the Middle East, would be in a position to supply that market.</P>

      <P>I was very impressed by the standard of operation of the company in Ballaghaderreen.  UMP invested in a major plant there, taking it over after the unfortunate failure of the Towey organisation which resulted in many farmers being deprived of payment for their stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, on 7 January 1992, a major fire engulfed the intervention stores at the United Meat Packers plant in Ballaghaderreen, a fire that most of us would consider impossible in an intervention store.  In that fire, 35,000 tonnes <Col N="725" /> of beef were lost.  It seems from the Minister's statement that this fire sparked off the crisis in the company, or at least it brought it to a head.  The company had to borrow £50 million to compensate for the loss, compensation which I presume will be forthcoming from the major insurance companies.  Some of that money should be made available in advance of the full discussions and negotiations which are taking place.</P>
    <P>The crisis in Ballaghaderreen, Ballyhaunis, Sligo, Camolin in Wexford, Banagher and Charleville is devastating to the economy, bearing in mind that United Meat Packers are responsible for 24.5 per cent of all sheep exports and approximately 15 per cent of beef exports and that in the next few weeks there will be a major increase in business in the lamb industry.</P>
    <P>On 17 February last an examiner was appointed to this company in accordance with the Companies Act, 1990.  As Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce I was involved in that Act which provided for the rescue of the Goodman organisation who experienced problems far in excess of those being experienced by United Meat Packers.  In the Goodman case, the examiner, Mr. Fitzpatrick, had to put together a package of £500 million.  I regard the examiner's activities in this case as lacking.  He has not operated the Act as it was passed by the Dáil.  I accuse him of total negligence as far as his responsibilities are concerned.</P>

Was a meeting called of the creditors of this company, including Banque Nationale de Paris, as provided for under section 21 of this Act?  The suppliers are at a loss of £1.5 million and are unsure about the undertakings given by Mr. Guilfoyle.  Mr. Guilfoyle has walked away from his responsibilities to the suppliers.  The company should appeal again to the courts for the appointment of an examiner, otherwise the Banque Nationale de Paris will move in quickly.  I am confident about the company's viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990, when the Commissioner rang a Dutch bank, the Opposition criticised him and when we assisted in the appointment <Col N="727" /> of an examiner to the Goodman Group we were criticised.  I compliment the work of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, who have been deeply involved in the efforts made over the last seven days in regard to United Meat Packers.  These people have been let down by the examiner who has walked away from the problem.  The IDA and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should take whatever action is necessary and the State should make whatever investment is required to rescue this company. This is a national crisis and I appeal to all concerned to act in a responsible way to ensure that the company are rescued.</P>

All that the Examiner wanted was the money to discharge the remit vested in him by the high court three weeks ago.  The remit was renewed last Monday and the termination date was not until next Monday. All that the Examiner wanted was one phone call from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, or the Taoiseach.</P>

That part of the country is wracked by unemployment, is ravaged by emigration and has suffered a massive downward spiral of population since the foundation of the State.  I come from an area known as the &ldquo;black triangle&rdquo; in terms of unemployment and emigration. We have never got our fair share of national resources.  In my county, it is said that one buys three suits in one's life &mdash; three suits for the three &ldquo;ations&rdquo;, confirmation, graduation and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House can imagine the jubiliation in my part of the country when, 18 years ago, Mr. Sher Rafique, came from his native Pakistan to Ballyhaunis, purchased a small meat plant and built up a £300 million export industry by hard graft, by the sweat of his brow, and with minimum State assistance.  The company developed to the stage that it now employs 900 full time and 600 part time employees and generates sufficient business for numerous small subsidiary industries, each one of which will go to the wall with this enterprise.  Mr. Rafique's enterprise gave growth, jobs and hope where before there was nothing but despair.  Mr. Rafique carved out markets in the Middle East with the Muslim communities, markets that no one else could have got.  He went out on his own &mdash; not courtesy of any State agency nor assisted, aided or abetted by a State agency &mdash; and negotiated his own markets.  He negotiated markets for every possible grade <Col N="729" /> of animal and built up a reputation that has resulted in his now being the second largest meat operator here.  Mr. Rafique built up the markets to such an extent that when he negotiated a major market in Iraq back in 1988 and looked for what was his share &mdash; the export credit refund &mdash; to protect his investment he received a telephone call from the former Minister for Finance, now the Taoiseach, telling him that it was all a mistake&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The decision by the Government to go through the motions of trying to save the enterprise and the jobs involved is nothing more than a pathetic, cruel farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in the House earlier this week when he gave grounds for optimism.  He was very optimistic that the plants could be salvaged and the jobs saved.  I listened to him today, after the Receiver had gone in, and he was equally optimistic that the jobs can be saved.  The jobs will be saved in a skeleton fashion in one or two of the plants, possibly in the south, but God help the west of Ireland.  The Minister is still optimistic, smiling as the ship goes down.  The receivership is now on, the vultures will move in, the company will be dismantled and the jobs will go to the <Col N="730" /> wall.  I hope, as Deputy Deasy said, that the appeal to the Supreme Court will be successful.</P>
    <P>On 28 August 1990 this House, and its sister House, the Seanad, were recalled. Emergency sittings were held; a section of the Companies Bill which was going through the House, was plucked out; an Examiner was appointed, and a £500 million rescue package was put in place to save the Goodman empire.  I wish to make it perfectly clear that I have nothing against Larry Goodman or his empire. In the putting together of that salvage operation the Government played a key, instrumental role by helping to assist the process along the way.  What a marked contrast there is between that operation and what happened in the past few days.</P>
    <P>Last night I listened to the Minister for Agriculture and Food say on the 9 o'clock television news that the Receiver would go in this morning.  There was no need for the Receiver to go in this morning, tomorrow morning, the next morning or the next morning.  The Examiner had until next Monday to put together a rescue package.  The will was not there and where there is a will there is a way.  I make the point that United Meat Packers Ltd. have less than one-twelfth of the debts of the Goodman group &mdash; I know what their debts are &mdash; and they employ half as many people, but neither the Government nor the banks would lift a finger to enable the Examiner to discharge his functions in completing the examination.  That makes a farce of the Companies Act.  Never again can an Examiner be called in, because one does not know when or at what stage the plug will be pulled by one or other of the banks.  As a result, and I am convinced of this, of a combined conspiracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The United Meat Packers group were the second largest meat processing operation in the country, having some five export-approved plants, slaughtering cattle and sheep at Ballyhaunis, Charleville, Ballaghaderreen, Sligo and Camolin, County Wexford.  It is widely accepted <Col N="734" /> that over the years this group played a major role in the lamb and beef processing sectors.  What we should be talking about today is protecting people's jobs.  Certainly I hope we will not have to pay social welfare to those workers.  I hope that when the receiver takes over he will be in a position to save all those jobs and acquire new companies to take over.</P>
      <P>I might compliment Deputy Deasy in having made a very good, well thought-out contribution, without engaging in any hysterics.  Deputy Jim Higgins spoke about not calling in the different organisations and financial institutions.  To date the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food have met the ICC, ACC, and IDA and the ICOS.  I understand also that the Taoiseach himself had discussions today with the chiefs of the ICOS who offered the full support of their members in playing their part in restructuring the beef and sheep industry, whether under a joint venture or some other arrangement.  Therefore, it is totally untrue to say that this Government have not been in direct contact with the different financial institutions and cooperatives and or their unbrella organisations.</P>
      <P>What the Opposition should bear in mind is that while the banks felt that the Goodman group were viable, the present operation of United Meat Packers group is not viable.  That is the difference.  The banks felt they could not become involved.  Therefore, we should base our remarks on that premise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Camolin meat plant in County Wexford is in my constituency.  I want to put on the record of the House that over the past week I have been in close contact with the Camolin plant, with the IDA and different financial institutions to ensure that that modern plant, with tremendous facilities, supplying lamb to the French market, is maintained.  Under any restructuring or possible take over of that plant I would foresee tremendous potential for its expansion, leading to increased numbers of jobs.  It is important that there be competition within the industry. I am concerned particularly about the <Col N="735" /> Camolin plant and the important role it plays in servicing Wexford sheep producers. I am also concerned that the market built up by United Meat Packers group should not be lost.  I will be making every effort to ensure continuity of processing at Camolin so that these markets will be maintained.  Competition within the meat industry, as in all other sectors, is vital.  Therefore, I will be anxious to ensure continued active competition for livestock in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>It is important to place on the record of this House that the Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Finance and the Taoiseach made every possible effort to ensure that the United Meat Packers group would survive.  When the receiver takes over I have no doubt he will make every effort to ensure this.  I am aware also that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has immediate plans to meet the receiver, with the food division of the IDA, to ensure that no stone is left unturned in ensuring that these plants continue as viable operations.  As junior Minister in the Department of Agriculture and Food I will be making every effort to ensure that the Camolin plant survives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in pleading that everything possible be done to ensure the continuance of this plant.  United Meat Packers Limited have enjoyed maximum investment on the part of the State and banks to date, their location in a disadvantaged area constituting one reason for their receiving the maximum grant. The plant was the best and most modern nationwide.  Their standard enabled them to compete abroad by way of FEOGA grants.  The group are in the unique position of having the best markets in the United Kingdom, Spain and the Eastern bloc, placing them in a very healthy position. I very much regret &mdash; as Deputy Jim Higgins said &mdash; that they are now embarrassed by having a minimum cash flow.  I am not so naive as to make a statement here without knowing the relevant facts.  The overall position is much more serious than that and warrants a <Col N="736" /> positive approach on the part of the relevant Ministers.  Indeed, I have been engaged in negotiations over the past few days with the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance and I compliment them both on the way they gave of their time so unselfishly to arrive at a solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>At present in the west the maximum number of sheep and cattle are coming on stream.  It is too serious for Deputy Jim Higgins, or indeed anybody else, to blow a fuse here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be preferable if Deputy Jim Higgins and other western Deputies &mdash; I know some are willing to do so &mdash; would sit down with us this evening in an endeavour to adopt a positive approach to this problem, rather than have the British press talk about us again &mdash; another Goodman affair, another meat factory gone to the wall.  That is not the type of propaganda western farmers want.  They want us to do something positive on their behalf immediately. That is why I am asking Deputies opposite to join with Deputies from west Mayo on this side of the House in an endeavour to bring about a positive solution to this serious problem.</P>
      <P>There are many farmers gravely worried today.  The plant in question is located in close proximity to my home, a place to which many farmers in Sligo, Mayo and Galway bring their stock.  An alternative proposition must be advanced immediately.  Whether or not the receiver will have been appointed, that constitutes the bottom line.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to convene a meeting with western Deputies this evening.  I have no doubt that he will do so and that it will be more productive than our discussion here this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting from what <Col N="738" /> Deputy Michael Woods said after the fire in the UMP plant:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It's the spirit of the people that matters at the end of the day&rdquo;, he said &ldquo;If you can get the support of the state agencies, you can come back and look on it as a tragedy overcome.  We do everything to assist&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods said that, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, on the site at Ballaghaderreen on 9 February after the disastrous fire in United Meat Packers.  Is there not a wide gap between that statement and the action of the Government and Government Ministers when they were really called upon to assist?  They did not assist.  Deputies should note the laden hyprocrisy of that statement when judged against the action when the time came to really assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the Taoiseach is here to see me paint some of the picture in the area most affected by this tragedy. The Taoiseach may know a little about it as he is a Deputy for the constituency. The Ballaghaderreen-Ballyhaunis hinterland in the five-year period from 1986 to 1991 lost about 8 per cent of its total population, when the population of the State remained stable.  That was way above the national averge and way above both the county averages.  Most of the people who left were aged between 18 and 25.  They left because there was no work.  The profile of the workforce in that area shows that 52 per cent of all people employed work on the land.  That is three times or almost four times above the national average of the workforce on the land.  Oddly enough, in that area, up to 20 per cent of the people who work in manufacturing industry work in the food industry, and the mainstay of the food industry was UMP.  Now we see this whole operation put in jeopardy, faced with liquidation.  Is the Taoiseach, as a representative of the area, willing to allow that to happen to 52 per cent of the workforce on the farms and then up to 20 per cent of the workforce in the food industry?  Does the Taoiseach support that?  I hope the Taoiseach intends to <Col N="739" /> respond to this debate and will make some points about it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this company can be saved and that it should be saved. Even at this late stage the Government State agencies could be brought into play to help the company &mdash; the kind of thing that the Minister, Deputy Woods, talked about after the fire.  Why are those statements not being made today?  I appeal to the Taoiseach to see this as something on his own doorstep, to be guided by the principle &mdash; and it is not narrow or parochial &mdash; that charity begins at home. Charity and help is surely deserved and needed at this critical hour for that area. The Taoiseach should contact the State agencies and use the influence of his office to ensure that those companies do not die.</P>

There is so much more I would like to say but I wish to yield to my colleague, Deputy Creed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  This crisis is the first real test for the new administration and unfortunately they have failed miserably in it.  It gives me no great joy to say this especially as the Minister for <Col N="741" /> Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh is part and parcel of that failure.  Today 900 people are facing the bleak prospect of life on the dole and a further 600 part-time seasonal employees face the same future.  It is ironic at a time when this House is contemplating the establishment of a jobs forum that 1,500 jobs are being thrown away for the sake of £4 million.  A simple mathematical exercise for the Government would show that the cost to the State of maintaining these jobs <i>vis-á-vis</i> the cost of paying dole to these people for a twelve month period is exactly the same.</P>
      <P>It is surely ridiculous to have a State agency like the IDA working to create new industrial jobs while the Government sits idly by and allows 1,500 jobs to disappear for the want of £4 million.  At the Beef Tribunal recently it emerged that the cost of one job in the beef industry is approximately £35,000.  Therefore, in the context of UMP it will cost the State between £32 million and £53 million to restore those workers to full employment in the beef industry.  All of this could now be saved for a mere £4 million investment to enable this company to trade out if its difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of months I have been concerned by the excessive control which the financial institutions have over the beef industry here.  They effectively control 70 per cent of the trade.  This is bad for the industry, bad for the farmers and now bad for the employees of UMP. Indeed, I have been seeking to raise this matter in the Dáil in Adjournment Debates on a number of occasions.  It is ironic that the control of the beef industry was deemed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food not to come within the ambit of his Department, and adjournment debates on it were also refused by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The reality is that inter-bank wrangling and a desire to squeeze out the Banque Nationale de Paris has given rise to this debacle.  The Government's failure to resolve this bank war is in stark contrast to the application of their ability and energies to coerce 33 different banks into providing £550 million to the Goodman <Col N="742" /> Group.  This clearly suggests political and commercial intrigue at the highest levels, the net result being a Goodman monopoly and the loss of 900 jobs.  I do not believe the protestations from the opposite benches that those two matters are not related.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the local issue, the Charleville plant.  The Minister in his address said that he hoped that the western plants would remain open.  I would remind the Minister of what he said when elevated to high office.  The Minister said that he felt that he had a particular responsibility to the Cork region.  Are the jobs in the Charleville plant, the 120 full-time and 80 part-time jobs secure?  I regret that the Minister in his address personalised his attack.  That is not what we have come to expect from the Minister. If the Minister wants to fight fire with fire I will fight back.  The reality is that the Minister was so closely associated with the Goodman food package in his time as a junior Minister in the Department that he fell out with his senior Minister at the time.  The Minister was so adamant that that programme should proceed regardless of cost to the taxpayer that there is now a serious question mark hanging over the Minister's commitment to the UMP group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of voicing my concern about the crux into which the company have fallen. When I was first elected to the Dáil this company were in their infancy.  Mr. Sher Rafique had been in Ballyhaunis for only a couple of years.  He had taken over a slaughter house and commenced operations in it.  The company grew under his leadership and expanded.  The enterprise and initiative of the owner were fully vindicated in the following years.  HalAl, as the company were then called, were responsible for creating a market for a type of lamb for which there had not been a market previously.  He cultivated that market and this, of course, was to the advantage of the hill sheep farmers in Mayo and neighbouring counties.  I regret that after enjoying wonderful success the company have now fallen into overwhelming difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demise of this company will have very serious implications for the communities in Mayo and other parts of the country.  It is not easy to attract industry to the west and it is very sad that an industry which was viable up to now and <Col N="747" /> provided very valuable employment is faced with the prospect of going to the wall.  This appalling prospect will have very serious implications not just for the people who are directly employed by the company but their families and the community in which they live.  Everybody appreciates the ramifications which the loss of employment for such a large number will have on the whole community.</P>
    <P>Approximately 600 people from east Mayo and Roscommon and 300-400 people in other parts of the country are affected.  It will have implications for the farmers who have delivered their produce to the factory over the past 17 to 18 years.  We all realise this but shedding tears will not help the company.</P>
    <P>I have been listening to the debate so far and to what was said on national and local radio.  I have read the print media since the crisis began.  It appears that the Opposition are doing their best to make a political football out of this crisis.  I accept what Deputy Deasy said, that he had no intention of making this issue a political football.  I have always found Deputy Deasy to be fair and objective and, indeed, he was that this morning.  I regret I cannot say the same about my constituency colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins. I have been listening to his statements on local radio since the crisis began and it is clear he is more interested in scoring political points than in finding a solution to the difficulties that threaten to overwhelm this company, and threaten the employment prospects of those who work there.  It is clear from his statements that this is the case.  For instance, he compared this to the Goodman crisis. There is no comparison between the Goodman crisis and this one except that the legislation which was put in place during the Goodman crisis is being used to assist the company in the appointment of an Examiner.  The Government made no grants directly to Goodman, just as they have not done so in this case.  I was delighted to hear the Minister refute the suggestion that favouritism was shown <Col N="748" /> to Goodman which was not available to UMP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach made an inadequate disclaimer a moment ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil was recalled to put legislation in place that would help the company.  It was successful because the company and their bankers successfully concluded their negotiations. The same machinery is in place in this case but, unfortunately, the bankers and the company could not bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins is claiming that only £4 million is at stake.  That is an insult to the people concerned, to anybody who is listening to him and, especially, to the people of east Mayo because everybody knows &mdash; even the dogs on the street &mdash; that much more than £4 million is involved.  I do not think the final figure has yet been determined.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the Deputy endeavoured to bring the Carysfort issue into the discussion, although it obviously has nothing to do with the present problem. Clearly he is attempting to make a political football of this issue at every opportunity. In this House he descended to a personal low and I have no intention of following him.  The jobs and the people concerned are far more important than scoring political points.  The Deputy mentioned the closure of Claremorris.  It was closed because it was owned by a private company and subsequently sold to another private company.  It was not in difficulties when it closed and the Government were not responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not interested in playing politics with the livelihoods of the employees of this company.  I am not interested in a short term solution which the provision of £4 million would bring about.  I am interested in a long term solution to safeguard jobs within the company in its various plants.  I am not letting the Government off the hook in this matter. I was heartened to hear the Minister say yesterday that he had been in consultation with the IDA on the issue and that he would be in immediate consultation <Col N="749" /> with any receiver appointed. The first phase of the battle was not successful but if the company go into receivership we will be entering the second phase of the battle.  There will be ample opportunity for Government intervention at that time.  I expect, Government intervention or not, that the company and their plants will be kept in business and that the employees will be retained.  It is difficult to provide new employment in the west.  What we have we must hold.  The people expect and deserve that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as I can because I understand that other Deputies want to contribute.  I will not utilise the full time allowed to me because it is important that Deputies who are concerned with the food industry in general, and those who have a constituency concern with regard to United Meat Packers, should be able to put a few brief remarks on the record.  It is interesting that this debate takes place in the shadow of an unemployment crisis, when detailed discussions are ongoing in relation to establishing a consensus on the creation of jobs.  It is our national priority.</P>
      <P>It is not without a great deal of sadness that we are faced with the huge threat to 900 jobs.  Each of these plants is in an isolated rural area which is extremely deprived.  In truth, many of them have no possible source of employment other than in the plants which are so desperately threatened.  In my constituency, north Wexford has been particularly badly hit in recent years.  The UMP plant at Camolin is in a vast rural area without any alternative industrial employment. A staggering 24 per cent of the north Wexford workforce are unemployed.  It is with desperation that the workers at that plant face the dawn of tomorrow and the expectation that the company they have worked for since 1987 will no longer be in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of great concern not only for the workers and their families but also for the farmers who supply that plant. The Camolin plant is exclusively concerned with the killing of sheep and since <Col N="750" /> 1987 it has developed a most successful and lucrative export market in sheep-meat, particularly in France, gaining a premium price for producers in the north Wexford area and the whole south-east. The use of the plant has increased sixfold since 1987.  The blow is not confined to the workers and their immediate families but will be extended throughout the farming community.  It is a problem which must be addressed with great urgency.</P>
    <P>The meat processing industry has caused concern for a number of years. Over two years ago the Leader of the Labour Party voiced his concern and called for a fundamental review of the whole meat producing industry.  That review must be carried out.  We have a new Minister for Agriculture and Food who is not long in that post.  He commands respect on all sides of this House and he would not have wished to start his career with this difficulty on his plate. However, it might spur him into taking action which he might not otherwise have taken in looking at the operations of the meat processing industry, the monopolies we have allowed to exist and how they operate in relation to pricing the product and the operating of their plants. I call for a fundamental look not only at this company but at all the meat processing companies to ensure that they can provide sustainable employment for those who want to work there.  The Minister and the Government must act now to address that problem.</P>
    <P>We have long said in our county that Wexford produces the finest raw materials.  We produce milk, meat and soft fruit and most of it goes beyond our county for re-processing and value-added. Although we produce the raw material, other places get the dividend in terms of jobs.  We have one or two successful processing operations in the county and we are determined to hold on to them.  The sheep processing at Camolin must be safeguarded.  I understand that the decision of the High Court is to be appealed to the Supreme Court by the company.  I request the Minister as a matter of absolute urgency to ensure, if <Col N="751" /> it is not possible for UMP to continue in operation on the existing scale &mdash; and I remain to be convinced of that &mdash; that an alternative is immediately put in place so that there is no disruption in employment for the workers who are producing a premium product for which there is a ready market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the liabilities of this company are in the region of £54 million and that assets total £62 million. The total workforce is in the region of 1,500, one-third of whom are employed on a part-time basis and two-thirds on a full time basis.  The company has a turnover of £250 million which takes care of 20 per cent of the total beef and lamb trade of this country.  The major difference between United Meat Packers Limited and other factories is that most of the produce is sold on the open market in England and in Europe, unlike other factories who put most of their produce into intervention.</P>
      <P>I understand a receiver will be put in place and that a percentage of the moneys owed to creditors will be paid.  Does that mean that the farming creditors will merely receive a percentage of what is owed to them on a <i>pro rata</i> basis or will a special case be made for the farmers who are owed in the region of £1.5 million to £1.75 million.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why so many of our meat processing plants get into financial difficulties?  Is it because of poor profitability levels in the meat business, or poor management or a combination of various factors?  Whatever it is, we appear to be hit by very poor performances in the meat trade over the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a national basis 15.5 per cent of our workforce is engaged in farming plus another 16.5 per cent in agri-related industries, totalling 32 per cent.  In the west, because of the lack of industry, 42 to 43 per cent of the total workforce will be directly concerned with the possible closure of any factories, but farmers from the neighbouring counties of Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo and <Col N="752" /> Galway would be most concerned at the possibility of any threatened closure.</P>
    <P>I should say I was dismayed at the comments of the usually very solid Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, when he expressed the wish that Camolin factory would survive.  He referred to that on a few occasions without mentioning any of the others, perhaps it was an oversight on his part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I became aware last week that the examiner to United Meat Packers was having difficulty in raising necessary finance, I took an immediate interest in the situation.  It was presented to me that the problem had arisen because the major creditor, Banque Nationale de Paris, was unwilling to provide any more support unless there was a contribution forthcoming from the Irish banks.</P>
      <P>I was in contact with the President of Banque Nationale de Paris and I suggested to him that the Bank might see its way to facilitate the Examiner in view of the potential loss of employment and loss of a business that has strong long term prospects.  At the same time my Department was in constant contact with the main Irish banks in an effort to persuade them to come to the assistance of the Examiner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of these efforts, the two main Irish banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, and Banque Nationale de Paris did come together with the Examiner with a view to finding a solution acceptable to all parties.  It appeared for some time that a solution was well within reach and there was really no problem about finding £4 million as such.  The essential point was that the Irish banks were not prepared to become involved, beyond assisting the Examiner on a purely temporary basis, because they saw no long term future for the company due to the large burden of debt.  I want to emphasise this point because the general impression conveyed to the public was that 900 jobs were at stake due to a failure to advance <Col N="753" /> the small sum of £4 million.  This is a misrepresentation of the situation.  The issue was about the main banker refusing to go further, without involvement from the Irish banks, while they refused to become involved until the question of a large burden of debt could be dealt with to their satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I should add, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the exact amount of the very large burden of debt is in some dispute: figures range from £25 million.  In a letter which transpired yesterday Banque Nationale de Paris were calling in their various debts of £41 million, other figures suggest that the burden of debt is £56 million, and other figures suggest it could be much more because of the very severe financial difficulties.  The precise figure is not known by any of the parties I have met.  During the past week I have had discussions with the insurers, the Irish banks, and Banque Nationale de Paris through the senior officials in the Department of Finance.  Also, I have had numerous conversations with senior members of management.  The burden of debt ranges from £25 million to £50 million.</P>
    <P>Thus an impasse was created and it gradually emerged that neither party would concede.  There is no merit now in dwelling on the rights and wrongs of the arguments advanced by each side.  The Examiner went as far as he possibly could to find a middle ground and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge his efforts over the last week.  He succeeded in obtaining a time extension from the courts when it appeared that a successful outcome was in sight but, in the event, this did not materialise.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable criticism of the Government on the argument that it was not active enough in finding a solution. First of all, let me make it quite clear that it would have served no useful purpose at all, if the Government had somehow produced £4 million.  The essential problem &mdash; lack of co-operation between the banks and a continuing overhang of debt &mdash; would remain.  While the Government could and did everything reasonably possible to persuade the <Col N="754" /> banks to resolve the matter, it could not order or direct the banks to take any particular line of action.  This would be in blatant contravention of the normal rules and the Government would no doubt be severely criticised.  While it may have appeared to the public that the banks were taking a very negative line, I want to put it on record, from my knowledge of events, that at all times the banks were genuinely conscious of their community obligations and were anxious to find a workable solution.</P>
    <P>The criticism has been levelled at Government that, while it showed great energy in the Goodman situation, they could not find a paltry £4 million to keep UMP afloat.  This criticism is, at best, a misunderstanding of the two cases and, at worst, it is mischievous to say the least. There is no comparison.  In the Goodman case all the banks were already committed heavily to the company and they asked the Government to provide a legislative vehicle through which an ordered arrangement could be put in place.  This was done promptly but there was no Government finance involved.  In the UMP situation, however, the fundamental problem is that those banks not already committed do not want to be committed until the problem of existing debt can be resolved.</P>

      <P>By yesterday afternoon it had become finally clear that there was no further prospect of continuing the examinership.  There was no possibility at all that the banks could reach agreement. The Government were monitoring the situation very closely and the Government's principal concern was to ensure that a disagreement between banks, however justified, would not lead to large scale loss of employment.  It would be a totally unacceptable outcome if the consequence of failure of the examinership was immediate and substantial loss of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the instructions of Government I had a meeting this morning with top <Col N="755" /> executives from AIB and Bank of Ireland.  I did not have to impress upon them the urgency of the situation and the obligation on them to act in the national interest in protecting a vital industry and protecting major employment.  I am glad to be able to say that both banks responded in a very positive way.  They made it clear to me that, in their opinion, receivership is the best option if the future of the industry is to be assured. Of greater significance, however, is their willingness to act immediately and constructively with the Receiver in providing working capital for an immediate resumption of activity and in providing, where appropriate, necessary financial support for potential purchasers of individual plants.  They consider that there is a viable industry which has sound future prospects and they want to be part of this.  In particular, I got an assurance from them that they are ready to support, with the co-operation of the Receiver, the immediate continuation of operations in the west of Ireland.  This is very good news.</P>

      <P>I am confident that the company itself and BNP, the main creditor, will also respond in a positive manner so that jobs can be protected and that the industry can be restructured effectively. UMP have made a big contribution to the development of the Irish meat industry during the past ten years.  Of particular significance is the contribution which they have made in the west.  It would be a great tragedy if this had to be undone because of financial failures and if a potentially viable business was allowed to fold up.</P>

    <P>The examinership has been terminated this morning and a Receiver has been <Col N="756" /> appointed.  I understand that he is on the way already and is due to land at Knock airport about now.  While the first duty of the Receiver must be the interests of the creditor I am sure that both he and BNP will be anxious to minimise disruption of production.  In any event, the best prospect for sale of assets, if this approach is being followed, is to keep the operation as a going concern.  I am sure the Irish banks will follow through the assurances which they gave to me this morning and that adequate working capital will be available to the Receiver.  The Government will follow developments closely and will be positive in every way they can in assisting the continuation of employment given the major number of jobs involved.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that a situation should have evolved where disagreement between banks on overall strategy should threaten immediate closure of one of our vital industries.  I believe, however, that in the event we have found a satisfactory outcome and I am confident that the plants will continue in operation.</P>

      <P>It appears since the debate began today that the only thing that Fianna Fáil Ministers want to do is try to show that Goodman International and United Meat Packers were treated in the same way.  That appears to be the only underlying message today.  I should say to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, that he is not new to this given that he was Minister for Food for five years.  I want to put three questions to him and I hope he will answer them when he comes to address the Assembly in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the occasion of the famous launch with Larry Goodman &mdash; the famous day of the musical chairs &mdash; when half the Cabinet sat with Larry Goodman and his associates, the Minister and the then Taoiseach committed the taxpayer to the payment of £25 million provided Goodman <Col N="757" /> International did X, Y and Z.  I wish to ask the Minister a straight question. He has said that no favouritism was shown to Goodman International as against any other company, in this case United Meat Packers, but may I ask him if United Meat Packers were afforded the opportunity to avail of money under section 84?  Was a similar amount of money made available to UMP as was made available to Goodman International since the launch?  Second, is it true that at that launch a clause was inserted which stated that 600 new jobs would be created.  It is my understanding that the Government asked that this clause be removed.  Does this not amount to favouritism?  Third, is the Minister aware that when Mr. Rafique, the owner and chief executive of UMP, arrived in Tuam in late 1987-88 to buy a site on which to build a factory &mdash; the Minister can check this with the chamber of commerce &mdash; he was told specifically by the Industrial Development Authority that he had no business opening a factory in Tuam because of the deal with Goodman International?  I defy the Minister to contradict me.  All I am saying is that favouritism was shown to the Goodman Group. Unfortunately, the Goodman Group got into difficulties and we were all left with egg on our faces.</P>

      <P>We are being told that the jobs are going to be saved and that the Government are doing all they can to ensure that this happens, but I suggest that the Government have no say in the matter.  If the banks say &ldquo;push off&rdquo; that is exactly what they will have to do. As long as Fóir Teoranta or some other State agency are not there to oversee the short term strategy of the banks we are undoubtedly going to pay the price.  One way or the other once the Receiver is appointed we will know on whose side he will be.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage the Government have an opportunity to show some real will.  Unlike most of the Members here, I dealt with Mr. Rafique and Halal the very first week he came to Ballyhaunis. I believed then that he was an independent minded man and, as Deputy Deasy said earlier, he ran a good company and sold meat where other Irish companies never sold it in years gone by. What I am saying is that if we take him and his company out of the equation there will be a lack of competition in the cattle and sheep meat sector all over the country, not just in the west.</P>
      <P>What is going to happen to the farmer with a £14,000 cheque in his pocket who telephoned me this morning?  That cheque bounced in the bank last Friday. Would the Minister tell me and the House what the receivership will mean for him and many hundreds like him who are small creditors around the country? My time must be up at this stage, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>The only valid test of leadership is to lead and to lead vigorously. The Taoiseach and the Cabinet will be judged on their performance in response to this calamity.  On this very day five years ago Fianna Fáil took office following the 1987 general election.  Connacht is now being turned into a wasteland by the continued drift from the land, emigration and industrial decline.  As I said, the Government will be judged by the people on their performance in response to this calamity.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Deasy pointed out, once the doors close and the gates are locked in any factory it will not re-open.  The factories in Castlebar, Claremorris and Tuam did not re-open and the Government did not deliver on their promise that a replacement would be found.  Despite meetings, discussions, protests and deputations once the padlocks are on that will be it.  A few years ago a plant in Belmullet was allowed to close on Christmas Eve but because of the power of the spirit and the will of the workforce, together with the agency involved, they were able to find a replacement.  The Culliton report indicates that there has never been as many opportunities available for this country as the number available to us at present.  I wonder, therefore, why all the Government speakers have failed to come up with any semblance of a solution to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I want to ask the Minister, Deputy Walsh, is whether all these plants will be saved and allowed to continue in operation.  Will it be possible for the courts under the section of the Act referred to by Deputy Leyden to appoint the Receiver as an Examiner to continue the examination in this regard?  Do we have at our disposal all the figures involved?  Is the figure £4 million, £50 million, £60 million or more?  Is there a black hole which we do not know about or are we witnessing a ritual killing by the Fianna Fáil Party with the butcher's <Col N="760" /> knife pointed towards the west?  As we are aware, there are people who would like to see this group go into receivership so that they would be able to buy the plants at Camolin or Charleville in the morning.  If this happens the vultures will gather and the asset strippers will be in like a flash.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority now tell us that it costs £40,000 to create a full time job.  If we multiply £40,000 by 900 we get a figure of £36 million.  Six hundred part time jobs multiplied by £20,000 is another £12 million, that is £48 million.  Taking an average of £150 per week for social welfare or unemployment benefits it would cost £1.17 million to pay 1,500 workers in a year; an average payment of £200 per week in unemployment benefits to the workforce would cost £1.56 million per year.</P>
    <P>The Government will be judged by their response to this calamity.  We do not want the province of Connacht and other areas turned into a wasteland.  I listened with interest to the Taoiseach's inaugural address at the Árd-Fheis last Saturday when he said that each and every opportunity would be made to retain, maintain or to put jobs on the market and would be examined in detail by the Government.  They now have the opportunity to do this.  Regardless of the jobs forum it is now up to Fianna Fáil in particular to ensure that all the plants remain open and continue in operation. We shall judge them by their performance.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of great concern to the west, particularly to the farmers and industrialists in that area because of the number of herd owners. In County Mayo there are 5,200 sheep owners and 17,000 cattle owners; in <Col N="761" /> County Galway there are 7,500 sheep owners and 16,800 cattle owners; in County Sligo there are 1,900 sheep herd owners and 5,900 cattle owners; in County Leitrim there are 980 sheep owners and 4,800 cattle owners; in County Roscommon there are 2,950 sheep herd owners and 840 cattle owners.</P>
      <P>Halal have created employment over the last number of years in the west and I am deeply concerned about people losing their jobs.  However, I have the greatest confidence in the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to ensure that these jobs will be restored.  I know what it feels like to be made redundant, I was made redundant from the GWI factory in Collooney many years ago, I know the pain of families who suffer as a result of a bread winner being made redundant.  That was a scaled down operation but, unfortunately, some years later the factory closed.  I approached the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, to try to keep GWI open.  A sum of less than £500,000 would have saved 150 jobs in the west but the money was not forthcoming from the then Minister and the Government of which he was a member.</P>

      <P>I must express my deep sadness at the closure of such a huge business as UMP and their subsidiary factories throughout the country.  Our <Col N="762" /> first concern in the face of the crisis at the UMP plant must be for the livelihood of the 900 permanent workers and the 600 casual workers and their families in the various plants in the west and at Charleville and Wexford.</P>
      <P>Given the scale of the jobs crisis, nobody wants to see the closure of any of these plants or the loss of jobs.  That is foremost in the minds of every member of the Government and indeed every Member of the House.  I regret the ritualistic Government and bank bashing which has constituted so much of the debate on this major crisis facing the west arising from the problems of the UMP group.  I am aware that there have been intensive efforts behind the scenes over the past week involving various Government Ministers, including my Progressive Democrats colleagues, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Molloy, in a bid to secure the future of the plants and the success of the examiner.</P>
      <P>The problems of UMP clearly go much deeper than the attitudes of the banks or any response which the Government could engineer.  We must also look at the very serious management problems which clearly exist in the company.  We should also examine how their debts of £45 million arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over half the Irish beef processing industry has collapsed into examinership or receivership over the past two years and it is obvious that one of the country's primary food processing sectors is in an alarming state.  Urgent strategic remedial plans must be put in place on an industry wide basis.  The knee-jerk, political bashing which has dominated the debate, especially from the Opposition benches, has been inadequate and unhelpful and will certainly not safeguard jobs.  We need a rational informed debate on the reasons for the beef processing industry reaching such a sorry state, in particular their reliance on a couple of big players. My colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, has taken action to prevent further ownership concentration in the beef sector. Many lessons must now be learned from the market dominance which meant that <Col N="763" /> any financial trouble in a single group inevitably affected many workers and farmers and undermines the well being of the entire community.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats will do everything possible at Government level to ensure that the various UMP plants are sold as a going concern.  We will also do everything possible to ensure that buyers are secured for all the plants so that beef processing can continue uninterrupted, that the interests of the workers, beef and sheep farmers will be secured and that the overall wellbeing of this vital food processing sector is put on a sound footing.</P>

I also wish to pay tribute to the Labour Party for meeting after the disruption of the Dáil this morning and the way they enabled the two and a half hour debate to go ahead.</P>
      <P>Halal and United Meat Packers had an enormous impact on the west.  Those of us who were in the Dáil when Halal were established and who have been in contact with them since &mdash; and who have been able to help the company &mdash; know how much they have done and what they mean to the west.  Deputy Kenny used the word &ldquo;calamity&rdquo;.  It is a calamity but questions must be asked in relation to how it overtook us.  The Minister for Agriculture quoted a figure of £270 million in turnover. If that is the case, how can the company now have liabilities of one fifth of that amount?</P>

      <P>How could a Government who depend on a fair amount of support in the west conspire against those on whom they rely?  The suggestion is ridiculous and not credible.  Reference has been made to what happened in the case of the Goodman group.  Without the legislation which enabled the Goodman package to be formulated this company would have gone into receivership two years ago.  However, the Opposition do not seem to understand that.</P>
      <P>It is ludicrous to say that United Meat Packers Ltd. could be saved by the provision of £4 million.  As everyone knows, it is not just £4 million that is involved. The provision of £4 million would have been easy if the Examiner could have given a guarantee to the banks that he would have been able to repay them after the examination period.  The Goodman package was agreed between the banks, the Goodman group and the Examiner. However the Examiner in this case found it difficult to get agreement.</P>
      <P>The scenario painted this morning by the Minister for Agriculture and Food is the best option for replacing and retaining these jobs.  I do not care who owns the company: my only concern is that these jobs should be retained.  I have suggested to the Taoiseach that, if possible, the State should purchase the company. I am sorry if what I have said is somewhat disjointed but it is difficult to say all I want to say in four minutes. Some of my colleagues and I have met the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance on numerous occasions during the past week to ensure that the maximum number of these jobs is retained in areas which badly need them.</P>

      <P>I was devastated at the announcement that the Examiner has thrown in the towel and a Receiver has been appointed to United Meat Packers Ltd., formerly the Halal company, and that they will now be put into liquidation. This will be a shattering blow to farmers in the west and particularly to those in County Galway.  I am very familiar with the sheep trade in Connemara.  Eighty per cent of hill lambs owned by farmers in Connemara are killed in Ballyhaunis or Ballaghaderreen.  These factories have built up a special trade for these sheep over the past number of years by going out and seeking openings in Middle Eastern and European markets.  No other factory in the country is geared to handling those sheep.  What prospects will those farmers have of selling their sheep in the future?</P>
      <P>I am also very concerned about the hundreds of farmers, many of them in my constituency, including Connemara, who have uncashed cheques.  I am not talking about thousands of pounds worth of cheques.  I am talking about cheques for £200, £600, £800 and, in one case, £1,200. I should like the Minister to say when farmers who have cheques in their pockets at present will be able to cash them. When will the east Galway farmers who have received larger cheques for cattle get their cash?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of what Members from the Government side say, I cannot help contrasting the Government's lack of action in this case with what happened in August 1990 when the Dáil was recalled for a 13 hour debate on legislation which made it possible for the banks to give £550 million to the Goodman group.  Yet, it is not possible to make the banks give a guarantee for £4 million in this case.  It has not been possible to do this because of the Government's attitude to the west: they seem to believe that the west should be <Col N="766" /> closed down and they do not seem to have any regard for the people who live there.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that three Government Ministers come from the west &mdash; two from Galway and one from County Mayo &mdash; nothing is being done for the west.

In recent weeks we have heard promises from the Government that they will tackle the jobs crisis, that there will be a new beginning on the jobs front.  If this is an example of this new beginning, all I can say is God help the country.</P>

I should like to know if, after the Receiver is appointed, the existing markets will still be there after a period of time.  I am sure they will not be there. This is an unique case.  I hope the Minister in his reply will give a guarantee that those unique markets will be retained.  I want to emphasise again the importance of these jobs and markets to the people of the areas affected.  As I said, people who have cheques do not know if they will get their money.</P>

      <P>I cannot say all I want to say in two minutes.  I am appalled at the extraordinary complacency shown by the Taoiseach and the Government to this debate in the face of 1.500 job losses. If this appalling prospect of job losses cannot move the Taoiseach and the Government to act, I question what will? How could the Leader of any Government refuse adequate time for a debate in this House on the impending closure of an industry which has a national dimension and which will affect not only the workforce but the entire country? Yet at the twelfth hour in the life of United Meat Packers Ltd., the Taoiseach sought to stave off a debate in the House and laughed.  I could not detect in his attitude any real concern or deep appreciation of the crisis or any need for urgent action on the closure of this company which will be a devastating blow to the entire country and the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask where this country is going under such leadership.  As Fine Gael spokesperson on Labour I refuse, as a result of the Taoiseach's attitude here this morning to accept as genuine any public expression by the Government of their deep concern for the unemployed or job creation.  They seem to be prepared to allow 1,500 job losses overnight.  Is it any wonder the Taoiseach is refusing to accede to the establishment of a jobs forum?  As a result of his attitude to the establishment of a jobs forum and the crisis in United Meat Packers Ltd., I can only conclude that the Taoiseach and the Government are neither interested in job <Col N="768" /> creation nor in retaining jobs.  The Government must intervene in this case quickly to cover the short term difficulties in UMP.  As Deputy Higgins pointed out, the Government must understand that the phenomenal cost to the State of an additional 1,500 people on the dole queue would far exceed the cost of saving the jobs on the spot.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that the Taoiseach could not consider this crisis worthy of an immediate debate in the House this morning.  In view of this, how could we expect the Taoiseach to make the responsible decision to provide £4 million to secure these jobs?  It must be remembered that the Government have the power to save these jobs but the question is, do they really want to?  The six mark question is: why are the Government reluctant to provide the financial resources to aid this viable industry in the food sector, a sector about which we hear so much and on which the viability of our agricultural industry depends?  We are now faced with the loss of 1,500 jobs and no action is being taken.  The Taoiseach laughed this morning in the face of the concern expressed by members of this party.

      <P>I thank Deputies from all sides who contributed in a very constructive way to this debate.  It is with no degree of delight that we in this House, particularly <Col N="769" /> the Government and myself, learned that a large part of the food industry, and indeed the economy, found itself in financial difficulty.  The company applied for the appointment of an Examiner to help resolve the difficulty.  The Examiner raised some money to try to keep the company in operation but found he had to seek additional money during the week.  The main banking group, BNP, which was exposed more than any other bank, refused any further involvement in the company without the involvement of the Irish commercial banks.  These banks took the view that, as BNP were the main bankers to this group and had allowed themselves to be exposed to a considerable extent, they would not be prepared to become involved.</P>
      <P>The management in this case had a responsibility to the workers and to the industry to run a good operation and not to allow the company get into difficulties. What we are talking about is a company with major liabilities, much more than the £4 million mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the problem could have been solved by providing £4 million, that would have been done.  During the past week slaughtering was discontinued at these plants and cheques to farmers have bounced.  As Deputy Belton said, markets are being lost.  The Examiner came to the conclusion that the situation would have become even worse if he continued for another week.  At that point it was the view of most people involved that a receivership was the best available option to keep the plants in operation, to retain the markets and to pay the farmers and small creditors who are owed money.  A constructive receivership, which is what is expected in this case, will re-open the plants and will in the long term &mdash; I am talking about weeks &mdash; sell them to people who will be able to operate them free of the heavy burden of debt which has been crippling UMP.  When a Receiver is called in, the debt is put to one side and it is the responsibility of the <Col N="770" /> Receiver to re-open the plants and ensure that they operate as a going concern. That is what I expect will happen.</P>
      <P>Comparisons have been drawn with various historical cases, particularly the Goodman case.  There is a crucial difference between the Goodman case and the UMP case.</P>

      <P>In the Goodman case the banks involved considered they could recover a substantial amount of the money owed to them through the sale of other assets outside the companies.  In addition, there was a possibility of the recovery of Iraqi debts after the hostilities there had ended.  However, no such possibilities existed in the case of UMP.  Before I leave this issue I will repeat what I said at the outset, that no Government money was provided to rescue the Goodman group.</P>

What has been happening in the meat industry, particularly in the beef industry, over the past few years has been no joy to anybody.  I, more than anybody else, would like to see an end to the crises. I would like to see the meat industry, particularly this organisation, put on a sound financial footing, with quality of management and of product so that we will not end up back in the Dáil insulting, accusing and criticising one another.  In many other parts of the industry, particularly the dairy sector, these problems do not arise because that sector is well structured and well managed.  I want to see the principles that apply in the dairy sector of the food industry applied in the meat industry.  I have no doubt that with my consultations and those of my colleagues in Government with the Receiver and with the State agencies involved, we will ensure a recovery in full in this case.</P>

      <Quest>if he agrees with the findings of research conducted in connection with household budget data collected in 1987, that the weekly cost of rearing a young child up to four years of age was £19.60 and the cost of rearing an older child from five years to 14 was £28.20 per week, both figures being based on 1987 costings; if he will outline the 1992 figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a research report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute in December 1988 entitled <i>Equivalence Scales and Costs of Children</i>.  The report estimated that in 1987 the weekly cost of rearing a child under five years of age was £19.60 and the weekly cost of rearing a child between five and 14 years of age was £28.20.  The corresponding weekly costs in 1992 terms are approximately £22.90 and £32.90.</P>
      <P>From July 1992 the combined weekly values of payments to various social welfare beneficiaries by way of the increases of their weekly payments for their children and their child benefit entitlements will range from £16.15 to £19.85 for one child and from £32.30 to £39.70 for two children.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report also estimated that the weekly costs of rearing two children aged under five years is £28.30, in 1992 terms.  From July 1992 all weekly social welfare payments for two children will exceed this amount, from a minimum of £32.20 to a maximum of £39.70.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget, the position of families was improved considerably.  All weekly payments will be increased by 4 per cent from July, which will more than maintain the real value of payments.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government stated their commitment to reach the priority rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare by 1993.  The lowest rates of payment will be increased by £3 per week from July, in line with this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other measures to benefit families include the increase in the income limits <Col N="775" /> for the family income supplement, which will mean increased payments of between £9 and £11 per week for most recipients. Payments under the back to school clothing and footwear scheme have also been increased by £10 per child to £35 for a child at primary school and to £50 for a child at second level school.  This allowance is paid to recipients of long term social welfare payments for children up to 21 years of age who are in full-time education.</P>
    <P>The Government are very aware of the particular needs of families and, under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> an additional £69 million in 1990 terms will be devoted to child income support over the next ten years.  The appropriate measures will be adopted in the light of up to date information on child and family circumstances and taking account of available resources.  The issue of the level of child income support itself and the research in the area, including the report referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>If that is so, may I take it that the Minister considers it reasonable that the child benefit scheme is worth just £4 a week?  I quoted the findings of a report based on 1987 figures, which indicate that it now costs more than £31 a week to raise a child from between five to 14 years of age.  Surely there is something terribly wrong with <Col N="776" /> the way that society and the Government treat children and women, too, who, unfortunately, have the most to do with the rearing of families.  There is a great imbalance in this regard.</P>

      <P>If everything in society were perfect and if the Government were flush with money or if any previous Government had been in such a happy position, perhaps some credence could be given to what the Deputy says.  The way I look on the child support scheme is in the context of all the benefits I have outlined, which are quite substantial in anyone's vocabulary and cost the State a great amount of money.  When all of the child support schemes and the other benefits referred to are added together it will be realised that we have arrived at the figures recommended by the report.</P>
      <P>In the study on which the report is based use was made of particular modules and it had a scientific foundation. That is not universally recognised as being the absolute basis for a study. Other experts in the area would have calculated their findings on a different basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment assistance is a means-tested payment.  Applicants have to show that their means, as assessed in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, are less than the maximum rate payable in their specific case.  Having satisfied the means test, applicants must then show that they satisfy the statutory conditions for receipt of payment of unemployment assistance.  These conditions are that a person must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking but unable to find, suitable employment, having regard to age, sex, physique, education, <Col N="778" /> normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.  These conditions are a common feature of unemployment schemes worldwide.</P>
    <P>In regard to the criteria of availability and seeking work, these are broadly (i) the extent to which a claimant has made efforts to obtain employment since becoming unemployed, (ii) the type of work the claimant is seeking, and (iii) the reasons for any restrictions which the claimant may be placing on the kind, place and hours of work sought.  In this context a change of residence would be evaluated to assess whether it resulted in a restriction on the type of work available to that person, having regard to their level of education and work experience. This evaluation also takes account of domestic or other commitments or circumstances which might have influenced the change of residence.</P>
    <P>Proof of compliance with the statutory conditions must be presented to a deciding officer, who is appointed to decide on the evidence before him/her, that an applicant is entitled to payment of unemployment assistance.  Each case must be decided on its merits having regard to the statutory requirements, the person's circumstances and the evidence furnished to support the claim.</P>
    <P>Decisions made by deciding officers are open to appeal to an appeals officer, who is independent in the carrying out of his functions as an appeals officer.</P>
    <P>Continuing entitlement to unemployment payments is tested regularly as part of the ongoing operation of the unemployment schemes.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable publicity given to recent cases where this continuing entitlement was tested in one specific area.  In that exercise 236 people were interviewed in the west Cork area within the last nine months.  The majority continued to receive their payments without interruption having satisfied the statutory conditions.  Eighteen of those investigated signed off immediately and another 59 were disallowed on the grounds of failure to satisfy the statutory conditions.  Twenty-one of those disallowed appealed against their disallowances <Col N="779" /> and seven were successful in their appeals.  Fourteen lost their appeals including five who did not attend their appeal hearing.</P>
    <P>The grounds given in respect of some of the disallowances were that the claimants were not available as they had placed an unreasonable restriction on their efforts to secure employment through choosing to live in a remote area.</P>
    <P>Another 14 cases have appealed their disallowances and their cases have been listed for appeal hearings which will be held soon.  It is clear that the cases were decided on the basis of the evidence presented in respect of each individual case, in accordance with the statutory conditions, and that the right of appeal was available to all who were disallowed. There was no departure from the normal criteria in use for many years.</P>

      <P>The Minister has sent a most worrying signal to people wishing to live in rural areas apart altogether from the situation in west Cork. Would the Minister confirm here today that the criteria laid down for eligibility for unemployment assistance will be applied consistently nationwide; whether to a person in Dublin city who cannot find work, or another person who cannot find work in a rural area in Mayo, Galway or Cork, assuring them that they will all be treated similarly?  The Minister will agree that a great deal of money has been pumped into building up inner city areas. Yet the signal coming from his Department over the past few weeks would appear to suggest that they want to stop people from going back to rural Ireland, something that cannot be accepted.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to give the Deputy the assurance he seeks.  Perhaps that signal could have been implied from a newspaper headline of a written answer to a parliamentary question <Col N="780" /> tabled by Deputy Connaughton some time ago.  The reply given to that parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Connaughton did not refer to any lifestyle whatsoever.  But one of the national newspapers then carried a headline &ldquo;no dole threat for good lifers&rdquo;.  I should stress that there is no change at all in the relevant criteria.  What brought this particular matter to light was the experience in the west Cork area.  I am glad to inform Deputy Connaughton and others that there has not been, nor will there be, any change in the criteria to be applied.  I should say also I am very pleased to note the progress made by Mr. Jim Connolly of the rural resettlement group; one of the aspects which should be encouraged is that people in urban areas who have been unemployed have a greater chance of a much better lifestyle if they move to rural Ireland.  Therefore, I want to allay any public fears caused by the headline devoted to the reply given to Deputy Connaughton &mdash; not his fault at all; it had nothing to do with Deputy Connaughton &mdash; not his fault at all &mdash; by saying there has been no change at all and that people can be assured that that will continue to be the case.  Every so often, the Department of Social Welfare examine all of the people on their register nationwide, but there has not been, nor will there be any change in the relevant criteria.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the reason his Department will not accept pre-1953 contributions in the calculation of entitlement for old age contributory pensions even though such contributions can be considered for a widow's pension; and whether this and other anomalies are being addressed by the Pensions Board.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Contributory widow's pensions has been in operation since 1936.  Since that date contributions payable by insured persons have included an element towards the cost of that scheme. Accordingly, contributions paid since 1936 by an insured person are taken into account in calculating the yearly average <Col N="781" /> number of contributions for the purposes of that scheme.</P>
      <P>In 1953 the unified system of social insurance was introduced which subsumed the widows and orphans pension scheme, the national health insurance scheme and the unemployment benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  To qualify for this pension a person must have entered insurance before the age of 56 years, have at least 3 years paid contributions and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered on his/her behalf since 1953 on the date of entry into insurance, if later.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension.</P>
      <P>However as a concession, and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of satisfying the yearly average test. However, they are still reckonable for the other two conditions.</P>
      <P>The whole issue of contribution conditions for social insurance pensions are among the issues being addressed by the National Pensions Board in their final report on a new national pensions system.  I expect to receive the board's report within the next few weeks and the matter will be considered further in this context.</P>

Would he agree it is not very difficult to try to get across to a person who is or should be entitled to a contributory old age pension that he or she is not so entitled when the same rules do not apply to widows?  Would the <Col N="782" /> Minister not agree that there is something terribly wrong here?</P>

      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Connaughton says.  In line with many of the social welfare schemes administered by my Department, I should say one would need to be traipsing around with a computer in train to ascertain all of the qualifying conditions.  I accept what the Deputy says.  I hope, within my time in the Department, to streamline some of these conditions because they are confusing.  Hopefully, the new National Pensions Board will address that matter.  However, over the past couple of years, with regard to pension conditions and so on &mdash; since 1988 and even last year &mdash; changes have been effected.  It would be my hope that, resulting from the report of the National Pensions Board, that confusion will cease.</P>

      <Quest>when the practice was instituted of requiring applicants for child benefit to include the RSI number of their spouses on the application forms; the reason this practice was introduced; if, in light of the recent Government decision to discontinue the requirement for farmers applying for headage grant payments to supply their RSI numbers, he will discontinue the requirement in the case of child benefit requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The practice of requesting applicants for child benefit to quote their own and their spouse's RSI numbers started in 1983.  The RSI number is the common reference number used in the majority of schemes operated by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1991, responsibility for the allocation of RSI numbers was transferred from the Revenue Commissioners to my Department.  This represented the first step towards the development of a national index for welfare purposes based on the RSI number which will improve <Col N="783" /> efficiency and also simplify the process for clients when making applications for the various benefits and allowances to which they may be entitled.  For example, the cross-referencing, when completed, will allow increases in respect of dependent children to be awarded automatically when other claims are lodged.</P>
    <P>I believe that the current arrangements will provide substantial benefits over the years, and I see no reason therefore to discontinue the practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First I might congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  Would the Minister agree that women are entitled to these payments and that compelling them to submit their spouse's RSI number is an abuse of or an intrusion into the equality area, since this payment is intended specifically for women in the home?  Would the Minster agree that this could lead to the future taxation of these benefits, as has been suggested by his Department in other areas?</P>

      <P>I do not agree.  About 85 per cent of all child benefit cases now have the RSI number.  Perhaps the Deputies received representations from the 15 per cent who are outside this system and have been asked the question. I hope to have the RSI number as a standard practice for all schemes in my Department as it would be one way to clear up many anomalies.</P>

      <Quest> when the dental scheme for spouses will be fully operational; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>As my predecessor indicated to the House on 19 December last, the Government have decided, in the interests of better targeting of social welfare benefits, that from next April persons earning in excess of £25,000 per annum will not be entitled to treatment benefit.  Under the dependent spouses scheme which came into operation in October 1987, a dependent spouse can qualify for treatment benefits only if the other partner qualifies. Consequently, a dependent spouse will not qualify where the other partner is earning in excess of £25,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>The measure will not result in benefit being withdrawn as it will apply to new claims made after the beginning of April. It is estimated that the measure will result in about a 4 per cent or some 18,000 reduction in the approximate 450,000 treatment benefit payments made in a year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the treatment of spouses, I am optimistic that the dispute between my Department and the Irish Dental Association which has interrupted the treatment of dependent spouses of qualified insured persons under the dental benefit scheme will be soon ended.  I am happy to inform the House that a formal offer has been made to the association which I am confident will bring this long running dispute to an end and enable dependent spouses to be treated by all dentists participating in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The settlement proposals comprise the introduction of a new dental contract for participating dentists and a revised and restructured schedule of fees for dental treatment carried out under the scheme. The new contract will more adequately reflect modern dental practice and I am satisfied that the revised schedule of fees will give dentists a fair and economic return for their professional services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Dental Association will shortly be balloting their members on the settlement terms which, if accepted, will <Col N="785" /> be implemented with effect from 1 July 1992.  The new contract will come into operation as soon as it is signed by individual dentists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On what basis is the income of the £25,000 assessed?  Will this new rule apply to people whose salaries are over £25,000 and to people whose basic pay is under £25,000 but who earn more than £25,000 due to bonuses and overtime?  How does the Minister propose to explain to people paying PRSI, which is a form of insurance, that they will not get the benefits of the insurance which they are paying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided on some cut-off limit and £25,000 was the figure agreed.  The qualifying conditions will be the same as they were before.  If a person is earning £25,000, whether he is a pound over the limit or £5,000 over the limit he is not covered. The relevant income will be the income on the P60 in the contribution year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was tabled before we became aware of the Minister's Ard Fheis statement.  We welcome the Minister's effort to tidy up this problem. Would the Minister agree that hardship has been caused to spouses who thought that under the scheme they were entitled to benefit?  Because the scheme was not fully operational many spouses whose husbands made the required contributions and were within the required income limits did not get the service to which they were entitled.  I congratulate the dentists who operated the scheme and I commend the Minister's efforts to reach a settlement.  Would the Minister agree there is hardship, that patients have been neglected and are being forced to pay for a service to which they had contributed? Will the Minister consider reimbursing them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot consider reimbursing them, as the Deputy knows.  It is obvious that, due to the lack of agreement between the Department and the dentists, people were denied benefits but <Col N="786" /> I cannot introduce a scheme to reimburse those people.  Much work was done by officials in my Department, before I was appointed, to try to reach a satisfactory conclusion to this dispute which has been going on for more than four years.  I thank the people in the dental association who have brought the discussions to this stage. I hope the dispute will soon be resolved. The dental association members are being balloted and I hope for a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response to Deputy Gilmore's question has nothing to do with the targeting of resources.  Will the Minister agree that to remove cover from the spouse of the insured worker earning in excess of £25,000, is discriminatory and affects womens' dental health?  Why does the Minister feel he has the right to discriminate against insured workers who are paying PRSI?  There is not any logic in that.  The Minister should reconsider the position adopted by his predecessor.  About 18,000 people have a very strong case on equality grounds, as citizens paying dearly under the PRSI scheme, for retaining the cover which the Minister proposes to remove from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people would find it better to resolve the dispute that has been going on for far too long.  There is a cost involved in this scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is funded by the taxpayer.  It is paid for out of social insurance and the Exchequer makes a substantial contribution to overall social welfare expenditure.  Perhaps, in the future I will consider some increase in the £25,000 limit, but this year that is the way it will apply.  I am glad we have reached a stage where we can resolve this dispute and will be able to operate the scheme.  The income limit obviously means that a number of people will be knocked out, but it is only a very small number out of the total number receiving benefit.  My Department estimate that about 450,000 people this year will apply <Col N="787" /> for treatment benefit and the cut-off figure will only affect 18,000 of them. This limit will only apply to new claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is optimistic that his offer will be accepted by dentists. Could the Minister guarantee that applicants from now on will be covered by the arrangements made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Claims made after the beginning of April only will be involved. A number of dentists are not operating the scheme.  People who apply to those dentists have not had the benefit of any treatment under the scheme.  Like everything else, anomalies will arise but I am sure the Deputy will bring them to my attention.  I hope there will not be that many of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that anybody applying for optical or dental benefit between now and 1 April, if his income is over £25,000, will qualify? Second, having regard to the cost of dental and optical treatment has he considered the implications of a cut-off point at £25,000 for pay and pay bargaining of people who are reaching that marginal level of income?  Whereas somebody on £24,500 will qualify for these benefits, a person whose income goes over £25,000 through overtime or whatever, will not qualify.  Will this not create a very serious anomaly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will create a serious anomaly because, as I pointed out earlier, based on previous years' experience of treatment benefit claims, approximately 4 per cent of the total will be affected.  No matter what cut-off point is used there will always be people who will attend constituency clinics and say they are just over the income limit.  There will always be a few who come to the constituency advice centre when they are affected by an income limit for any social welfare scheme.  The Deputy, as well as every other Deputy in the House, knows that.</P>

      <P>The National Pensions Board have submitted four reports to date, three of which have been dealt with by regulation of occupational pensions and the fourth dealt with the extension of social insurance cover to the self-employed. We will study the report when it becomes available and then it will be necessary for the Government to consider it.  I do not think Deputy Browne should make that assumption at this stage.  We should all await the publication of the report.</P>

      <P>I am committed to giving all the clients that my Department deal with a personalised and localised service.  In line with this a number of initiatives have already been taken and others are in the process of being developed.  They will make extensive use of information technology in order to provide clients with a timely and dignified service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main targets that has been <Col N="791" /> set for the recently appointed regional managers is the implementation, on a phased basis, of the one-stop-shop concept in all social welfare local offices in their regions.  In addition, it is planned to expand the information service at local level to provide a comprehensive service to all social welfare clients, including claimants, employers, employees, community and voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>My Department over the last few years have undertaken a major development programme to improve the standard of accommodation in all local offices.  The need for privacy is a major consideration in the design of all new offices and in the refurbishment of existing ones.  To date 17 new offices have been built and 11 offices have been refurbished.  A further seven new offices are under construction and three are being refurbished.</P>
    <P>A further development will result in more modern payment systems for the unemployed and, indeed, for other categories of social welfare recipients.  These changes will, over time, have profound effects on the way business is transacted in the local offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his positive reply.  I compliment the private individuals who are providing offices on contract to the Department of Social Welfare.  This is at some quite considerable expense to themselves, and my own constituency is no exception.  Is it the Department's intention to retain accommodation provided by private operators, because they have expended considerable moneys in the recent past on refurbishing their premises?  I would like an assurance that these offices will not be absorbed into the State offices. We are always trying to improve facilities and when the people providing accommodation on contract make the effort to improve the facilities &mdash; because it is very traumatic to have to queue in the rain &mdash; these facilities should be retained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ferris has put a number of questions and my reply to some of them may not be to his liking. <Col N="792" /> My Department's priority &mdash; and this is certainly my priority &mdash; is that people should be able to transact their business in private.  It is painful enough to be unemployed and signing on without putting additional hardship on them at the employment exchange.  It has been the Department's policy for some time to upgrade, where possible, and build new offices.  Deputy Ferris asked a question about branch employment offices provided under contract.  That is a totally separate question.  However, let me say that officials of my Department visit such offices and make recommendations on the standards to be achieved.  That will continue to be the position.</P>
      <P>There will be branch employment offices for a number of years but, with the streamlining of the Department of Social Welfare, which is my major priority, whether my time be long or short, I would not like to give a commitment as to how things will be at the start of the next decade.  I hope to make it simpler and easier for people to draw unemployment assistance or other payments without requiring the signing and counter-signing of documents which, in the light of modern technology, is inefficient at least and degrading at worst.</P>

Will he reassure me that special inspectors will not be allowed to enter employment exchanges and exploit the so-called user-friendly atmosphere to call people aside and make a show of them in front of other members of the public?  They have been known to examine the texture of a person's hands, for example, in an effort to prove whether he has been working.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on the Treatment of Households in the Social Welfare Code has been made available and has been widely distributed.  I have invited views on the report in line with the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  An advertisement carried in all the national newspapers on 17 January asked that comments on the report be sent to my Department before the end of March.</P>
      <P>The report addresses a number of fundamental issues in relation to the social welfare payments system.  Among these is the question of whether the present structure of payments, involving personal payments and separate increases for adult and child dependants, is the most appropriate and whether a different system would be more equitable.</P>
      <P>The review group identified several options for the future development of the social welfare payments system but was unable to reach a consensus on what would be the most suitable approach in the short term.  These options, and other issues regarding the payments system raised in the report, are complicated ones and further consideration of the report and the finalisation of proposals will take some time to achieve.  However, the matter will be given urgent consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of individual payments of adult dependant allowances generally would have major administrative implications <Col N="796" /> and the appropriate arrangements in this regard will be considered in context of the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to address the complexity of the report.  The Minister will be conscious that it was required in 1989 because of the Supreme Court judgment in the Hyland case.  The report was produced in 1991 and now the Minister is looking for opinions of members of the public and other interested groups who have already made contributions. When will the Minister make a decision to move at least on some of the recommendations in the report, for example, that concerning dependent spouses. Would he agree that the classification of married women as dependants could effectively be abolished and that they should be getting an entitlement of 70 per cent of the rate of the welfare recipient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If this were a simple matter I am sure previous Ministers would have resolved it.  During the time I have been in the Department I realised that this area &mdash; the Deputy is probably much more <i>au fait</i> with it than I &mdash; is one of the most complex and complicated, legally and otherwise, in the Department. I wish to inform the Deputy I will not be making a quick decision on this matter as he seems to imply.  The cases to which the Deputy referred are very complicated.  The review group put forward various options but there was disagreement as to which option they favoured.  It is a very complex area and I will not be rushed into making a decision. Advertisements were placed in the newspapers recently and in the light of the response I will consider my decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is a complex area. That problem has existed since 1989. Would the Minister not agree that in the time span it has taken to make a decision his Department have added further complications because there are so many anomalies regarding the treatment of couples contained in the social welfare code?  For example, last year under the social welfare code, cohabiting couples were <Col N="797" /> deemed to be the spouse of one another for social welfare purposes but under the Finance Act that same classification was not allowed for tax purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 23 in the name of my colleague Deputy Ryan refers.  The Minister said that individual payments are causing tremendous administrative problems.

At this stage, having studied the matter just for the past few weeks &mdash; I have not spent all my time studying this matter &mdash; I have not formed an opinion good, bad or indifferent about the study.

Is he not aware that in many cases there is abuse of that entitlement by men recipients who spend the money on drink and do not give the money to women, thereby depriving them of a means of livelihood?

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A new approach to managing the delivery of social welfare services at local level is being implemented by my Department.  The first stage of the improved service involved the establishment of regional management centres and a phased broadening of the role of my Department's employment exchanges.  The regional centres are based at Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Longford, Sligo and Waterford.  Each centre is under the control of a regional manager who is based locally and who is supported by a management team and a network of area managers also based in the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having a more comprehensive service available locally will mean that employment exchanges, which traditionally dealt with unemployment payments, will be gradually transformed into complete one-stop-shops for social welfare purposes. In these new style centres pensioners, lone parents, unemployed people and families who are out of work through illness will receive the social welfare <Col N="799" /> services, advice and any information which they may require.</P>
    <P>The new regional management structure will mean: one-stop-shops for all social welfare customers; better services for employers; better controls to eliminate abuse of PRSI and social welfare schemes and new supportive relationships with the voluntary and community groups working in the area.  To service this new structure, 45 additional staff were provided.  Their grades are as follows: one principal officer; four assistant principal officers; six higher executive officers; 12 executive officers; eight staff officers; four clerical officers and ten clerical assistants.</P>
    <P>In addition, several hundred locally based staff have been regraded.  This change means that a more flexible approach to responding to the evolving needs of social welfare clients is now being implemented.  It allowed existing staff to be deployed to assist the extra staff assigned in 1991 and each regional centre now has a full-time team in full operation.</P>
    <P>Enhanced quality of services will require the continuing and increasing use of information technology.  My Department is one of the most advanced public sector users of computer technology in Europe.  Almost all local offices of the Department have access to a central computer system so that client information, in respect of people who call to my Department's offices, is readily accessible. Almost one-third, 14,000, of all weekly medical certificates for disability benefit purposes are now being processed locally and the extension of this facility will be accelerated by the new local structures.</P>
    <P>A programme of upgrading the social welfare office premises is also under way. In recent years a total of 17 new offices have been provided and a further ten have been extensively refurbished.  New offices are also planned for a number of other centres.  My aim is to ensure that people transact their business with my Department in privacy, with dignity and in comfortable surroundings.  This is <Col N="800" /> being done in conjunction with the restructuring of the provision of services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record my welcome for the one-stop-shop concept.  We have heard similar statements from the Minister's predecessor.  Is the Minister aware of the massive difficulties in the social welfare appeals office &mdash; launched about 12 months ago &mdash; which centre on the sentiments expressed here about the ability of the Department to move forward? Would he agree also that the quality of service and standards prevailing in, for example, the Navan Road, Thomas Street and Werburgh Street employment exchanges is unacceptable?  Even in Victorian days, when they were first built, they were not acceptable.  Would he agree that the 45 staff he has listed for the regional management centres will be sufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Byrne will be aware, this is the one area of State where the numbers being dealt with is continually increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right; I wish it was the other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is self-evident. The problem is so great that staff numbers may have to be increased.  We have done our best to supply sufficient resources to the areas of need; not all the employment exchanges throughout the country are as I would like them to be but we are making progress in that regard.  Since I became Minister for Social Welfare seven senior management posts have been created to ensure that the progress already under way can be accelerated, leading to a more fully integrated welfare system so far as income maintenance is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the Deputy can point to those places where everything is not as perfect as should be but, in turn, I could point to those offices which have been upgraded and where improvements have been made.  Needless to say, that would not be of much help to those people who have to deal with those offices which have <Col N="801" /> not been upgraded.  However we are making progress and we will do our best to make sure that that progress continues. We have a building programme and we are spending a good deal of money doing the things to which the Deputy referred.  We have done a fair amount and I hope that in the coming months and years we will be able to improve the facilities available in the way the Deputy would like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that I support the concept of the one-stop-shop but what concerns me &mdash; I assume this is what my fellow Deputies are concerned about too &mdash; is the length of time it takes to show that this concept works.  I fully appreciate the horrendous problems facing the Minister but given the rate at which the number of files is increasing and the extent to which files are moved around unnecessarily, I am sometimes put to the pin of my collar in tracking a file which may be moved around between Dublin, Galway and Athlone.  I am sure the Minister would not mind, therefore, giving those of us who have an interest in this matter the opportunity to visit, semi-officially, a one-stop-shop which is working well.  I would certainly appreciate the opportunity to be shown around such a shop so that we could see how claims are processed at first hand.</P>

I have not been able to visit any of them nor indeed any of the branch offices as I have been too busy.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>All the necessary orders bringing the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1990 into effect have been introduced.  The requirement under various sections of that Act for the mandatory introduction of regulations has also been met.</P>
      <P>A number of orders and regulations providing for the introduction of various provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1991 have yet to be introduced.  Regulations relating to child benefit under section 6 of that Act, to define the circumstances in which a qualified child will be regarded as receiving full-time education, will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>Sections 18 to 20 of Part III of the Act provide that reduced rates of disability and unemployment benefit and invalidity pension will in future be determined by reference to earnings rather than numbers of contributions paid.  The new arrangements will apply to all new claims which are made on or after 4 January 1993 and the necessary regulations will be introduced in advance of that date.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of Part III of the 1991 Act provides for the standardisation of the existing maternity benefit provisions. Further amendment of the maternity benefit provisions are necessary before this section is brought into operation. These amendments will be provided for in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 50 of the 1991 Act enables regulations to be made prescribing the manner in which a person will prove unemployment.  This is to facilitate the introduction of alternative payment methods.  I am awaiting the outcome of a number of pilot schemes on alternative payment methods which are under way at present and the regulations will be made in the light of the outcome of those schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 43 of the Social Welfare Act, 1990 and sections 51, 54 and 56 of the Social Welfare Act, 1991 contain discretionary powers for the making of regulations <Col N="803" /> in relation to such matters as rounding of rates of payments, making certain deductions with the consent of the recipient and minor changes to the means test.  Proposals for regulations in these areas are at present under consideration by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is his intention to have the regulations completed before the 1992 Social Welfare Bill is introduced in the House? Second, in relation to the pilot schemes on alternative payment methods to which the Minister referred &mdash; essentially, these schemes provide for the making of cheque payments to certain categories of social welfare recipients &mdash; given the outrageous position adopted by the banks, who initially issued an order to bar cash payments in respect of cheques and who subsequently had to review their position because of a public outcry, and given the current dispute in the banks, would the Minister tell the House how he intends to make payments to those who are in receipt of cheque payments at present should the dispute escalate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has mentioned the possibility of an all-out bank strike and while it is a matter for another Minister, this would have implications for the pilot schemes which are in operation. However, my Department will make alternative arrangements to overcome that problem.  It is my intention to introduce a programme over a number of years to allow people avail of alternative payment methods.  With modern technology and computerisation, it should be possible for people to avail of alternative methods.  In the short time I have been in the Department I have discovered, in relation to the problem mentioned by Deputy Byrne, that the banks have resisted the introduction of certain transactions because they do not want further complications in the system.  We are endeavouring to bring about a situation where everyone would have the opportunity to avail of alternative payment <Col N="804" /> methods if they so desire.  We hope to make progress on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In his initial reply the Minister referred to regulations dealing with means testing.  What exactly does he have in mind?  I hope it will not be made more strict than it is already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I do not have the answer to that question the Deputy will have to put down a separate question. Like many of those listening, I am not an expert on this matter.  I am sure, however, that when my predecessor dealt with this matter during the course of the debate on the two previous Acts he outlined what was intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to let us know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations which the Minister said are outstanding would all seem to be &ldquo;bad news&rdquo; regulations. Would the Minister consider publishing the bones of the orders when made so that the public would be aware of the changes which will make it more difficult in nearly all cases for the public to receive various payments in the same way as he publishes good news, for example, increases?  It is important that the public be fully informed of their entitlements and of how they might go about getting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something that could be considered, Deputy.  Since politicians are always quick to give out good news it would be no harm if we published regulations when they are amended. While I will have to check what the procedure is in this regard, in principle, I would not be averse to doing that.</P>

      <P>At present details of regulations are readily available in the Department.  I will try to find out if we intend to publish regulations in the future.  I would have thought, however, that people find out about the changes <Col N="805" /> quickly enough when they contain bad news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if recipients of United Kingdom retirement pensions or of social security payments from the United Kingdom have the right to relinquish same and opt for payment of full Irish pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 14 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>A recipient of retirement pension from Britain or any other country can qualify for an Irish non-contributory old age pension where the rate of retirement pension is lower than the rate of non-contributory pension.  Where the retirement pension is subsequently increased the non-contributory pension falls to be adjusted accordingly.  It is not open to a pensioner in these circumstances to relinquish the retirement pension and opt for full non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be no overall financial advantage to pensioners doing this, in that, under the structure of the non-contributory pension means assessment, pension entitlement is adjusted in direct proportion to weekly means.  Furthermore, the legislation provides that in circumstances of this kind the yearly value of the pension would have to continue <Col N="806" /> to be regarded as means for the purposes of determining entitlement to Irish old age non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>In the particular case raised by the Deputy, the person concerned was in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension of £32 per week.  This included an allowance of £11 in respect of her husband.</P>
    <P>In February 1992 her entitlement to pension was reviewed.  Arising from an increase in her means derived from her own and her husband's British retirement pensions, her Irish pension had to be reduced to £23 per week with effect from 21 February 1992.  This rate of payment includes an allowance of £8 per week in respect of her husband.  I should point out that, in determining her means and consequent rate of pension, the first £6 of her weekly income from her British pension was disregarded.</P>
    <P>In February last, the Deputy wrote to my Department indicating that the person concerned wished to appeal against the decision to reduce her pension. She has been asked to set out formally the grounds of her appeal to allow the independent social welfare appeals office to reassess her case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I am not <i>au fait</i> with the Deputy's question although I heard him speak about it.  I did not hear the first part of the Minister's reply.  Does this person have an option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that her concern relates to the exchange rate mechanism and that, over the years, she and her husband received less than if they had been entitled to a full non-contributory pension here.  Will the Minister agree that it would be unusual if they were financially worse off because they were entitled to a non-contributory pension in this country anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>They should not be worse off because of means testing of another pension.  However, when the British pension is increased the means of <Col N="807" /> the person change and the Irish pension should be reduced.  In the meantime it can happen that the Irish pension has been increased and it goes on like that. In many cases, a number of years elapse before a person's means come up for review and it can get quite complicated. It is not possible for a person to say that he or she does not want a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>They should not be worse off but, as I said, increases in different pensions cause complications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the withdrawal of small sums in relation to Irish non-contributory pensions?  I am speaking about sums of £3, £4 and £5. This is caused because of the link with the British pension and the Irish non-contributory pension which may allow a living alone allowance, free electricity and free telephone rental, which can be lost for the sake of £1 or £2.  I hope the limit of £6 to which the Minister referred will be applicable because I have seen documents from the Minister's Department which seem to disregard it in relation to very small Irish non-contributory pensions.  Is the Minister aware of the widespread withdrawal in cases of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not but, if Deputy Ferris brings a case to my attention, I will have it examined.  There was a period during which the means of people were not reviewed and people have suffered as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that because means were not reviewed for a number of years it is now causing hardship and concern to many?  Will he ensure that there is an annual review so that large sums will not be deducted from one payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That will depend on resources and staff available in my <Col N="808" /> Department.  Because of that I cannot give a commitment in this regard but I hope the situation to which Deputy Stagg referred will not recur.  In relation to an earlier question by Deputy Connaughton, it might have been inferred that there will be an increase of 4 per cent in some child benefit payments this year.  However, that is not the case; the 4 per cent will apply to all increases payable in respect of child dependants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Finance the plans he has to ensure a full banking service in view of the announcement by AIB that they are suspending staff from today, and that the other associated banks are likely to act similarly; and if he will make a statement on the likely effects of a prolonged bank dispute on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a full banking service is a matter for the banks concerned.  Yesterday at the Labour Relations Commission meetings with both sides in this dispute failed to reach agreement and I understand that no further talks have been arranged.  I would appeal to both sides in this dispute to make full use of the labour relations machinery that is there and seek a solution acceptable to both sides.</P>
      <P>I have been following developments closely and I understand that, while a small number of AIB branches have been closed since this morning the situation is that AIB hope to reopen these branches as soon as possible and that all ATM machines will continue to operate.  I would also like to point out that as of now all branches of other associated banks and, indeed, other credit institutions continue to operate normally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> In the event of a more widespread bank stoppage the Government would have to consider how the inconvenience to the public and the economy could be alleviated. The officials of my Department are continuing to monitor developments in this regard and have been considering contingency arrangements in the event of a bank stoppage.</P>
    <P>While the stoppage is not as dependent on the associated banks as it was in the past a prolonged bank strike could still have serious detrimental effects on the economy but I cannot say in any precise way what the overall impact would be.</P>
    <P>We are still monitoring the position which has been changing by the hour since morning.  While the banks' management hope to reopen the banks shortly it is not too clear when they will be in a position to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick-East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> Is the Minister aware that over 1,000 employees of Allied Irish Banks have now been suspended and that the other associated banks have arranged to make deductions of 20 per cent from the wages and salaries of their employees?  Is he aware that this is causing major disruption in the banking system, will lead to enormous inconvenience for customers and will have a seriously disruptive effect on the economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I understand that about 20 branches in the Dublin area have closed.  However, AIB hope to reopen these branches as soon as possible and as 1,000 staff will be involved, they will provide limited services with the help of management.  AIB have informed the Department of Finance that all the automatic teller machines will continue to operate.  AIB also believe that the other banks will be dealing with their customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan stated, the Bank of Ireland said today that from tomorrow staff who do not sign an undertaking to discontinue the dispute will have their salaries cut by 20 per cent.  I understand that both the Ulster Bank and the National Irish Bank will also cut the salaries <Col N="810" /> of staff continuing the dispute by 20 per cent.  The Bank of Ireland said in their statement that many of their staff have signed the undertaking.  I have no definite information on whether that is correct.</P>
    <P>If the dispute escalates and the associated banks' branches are closed it does not automatically mean there will be a complete stoppage in the services provided by the associated banks.  My information from the banks is that they are satisfied they will be able to keep their hard core banking activities in operation and maintain certain services for customers. Hopefully these will include key services such as the clearance system, the electronic funds transfer service, the automatic teller machines and the provision of a skeleton service for customers. We are continuing to monitor the dispute by the hour as there may be changes. Hopefully the major action threatened for tomorrow will not happen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour asked both sides to use the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court to monitor the position. Discussions <Col N="813" /> were held in the Labour Relations Commission office yesterday but were adjourned without progress being made.  The Labour Relations Commission continue to keep in touch with the parties with a view to exploring the possibility of arranging further negotiations. I urge both parties to avail of the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court and to enter into discussions in a spirit of good will and co-operation.  The Minister for Labour and his Department will continue to keep in touch with the situation and monitor developments.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that since this morning an extra 1,000 people are out of work &mdash; the number is rising &mdash; as a result of this dispute which has continued for almost eight weeks, will the Minister consider at this stage intervening in the dispute?  Alternatively, will he consider, under section 38 of the 1990 Act, calling on the Labour Court to intervene in order to avoid escalation of a dispute which could have disastrous consequences for our economy at this time?</P>

I understand a considerable amount of progress was made at those discussions but they did not come to any fruitful conclusion.  The commission believe that further talks would be helpful.  I know the Minister for Labour would ask me to urge both sides &mdash; the Irish Banks Staff Relations Committee led by Bill Brown and the IBOA led by Ciaran Ryan, both experienced negotiators in the industrial relations field &mdash; to come together at the Labour Relations Commission office to continue where they left off yesterday to try to avoid an escalation of the dispute.</P>

I sincerely hope that is not the attitude of <Col N="814" /> the Minister for Labour to the people who are involved in the dispute.  Does the Minister agree that the Labour Relations Commission can only work effectively if the parties in dispute are determined to make it work effectively?  Does he also agree, notwithstanding the duration of the dispute, and judging by the aggressive public statements by management that there does not seem to be serious intent in this case?  Finally, does the Minister agree that any attempt to take the matter to court, as threatened by the AIB management, would only worsen this dispute and that attempts should be made to make the industrial relations machinery work so as to prevent further damage being done to the economy and hardship being inflicted on the public?</P>

      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte correctly stated, any threat of court action or strong talk by either side will only make the problem worse.  This dispute was signalled for many months in advance and it covers a wide range of issues.  The only way the dispute can ultimately be resolved is through meaningful and constructive conciliation talks.  As Deputy Rabbitte rightly said, the Labour <Col N="815" /> Relations Commission can only create a constructive and positive atmosphere for discussion, if both sides are willing to participate.</P>
      <P>As I have said, both Bill Brown and Ciaran Ryan are experienced people in this business and I would expect them to understand the value of the Labour Relations Commission or whatever machinery is necessary.  As Deputy Therese Ahearn said, if the Labour Relations Commission do not solve the problem there are other options to be considered.  If exceptional circumstances warrant it, the dispute could go to the Labour Court under section 26 (5) of the 1990 Act.  The Minister for Labour may also refer it to the Labour Court under section 38 (1).  Since progress was made by the Labour Relations Commission, it would be much better to follow this line over the next few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the 20 per cent reduction in income and the intimidation by the banks of IBOA members, who are in pursuance of their legitimate industrial claim, is deplorable and unacceptable?  Furthermore, would the Minister not agree that the selective action by management of AIB in suspending 1,000 of the 5,500 staff has brought about a run on the banks and that this undermines the confidence of the public in the banking system?  In these circumstances would the Minister call on the management of AIB to reinstate the staff immediately and restore industrial relations so that the dispute can be resolved before there is a recurrence of the last national bank dispute?  In that instance hundreds of small business people were forced to close down.  The reaction of the Minister for Finance does not augur well for this strike.  Both he and the Minister for Labour should intervene to bring the dispute to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, the banks will handle the matter.  The Deputy is right in that I have never seen a dispute being resolved by people taking tough line action on one side or the other.  The management have a right to do as they see fit just as the staff have a right to take action as they see fit.  However, that will not resolve the dispute.  Neither will it be of help to the customers who are inconvenienced by the dispute and who are likely to be further inconvenienced if it escalates.  I am sure I speak for every Member of the House when I say that it is important that the warring factions on both sides in the dispute sit down with the Labour Relations Commission to try to resolve the problem.  Before I came into the House the Labour Relations Commission informed me, through the officials in the Department of Labour, that they will be available to both parties this evening and throughout the night to enter into discussions to bring the matter to a conclusion.  As I have outlined, if that does not happen and the dispute escalates there are other mechanisms that may be used.  In the meantime this House should urge both sides to use the mechanisms that are there for the resolution of industrial disputes and to try to avoid inconvenience to the public, to business and to the community at large.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am favourably disposed to the first part of the Deputy's amendment.  In principle it is appropriate that every order be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Perhaps I may give an undertaking in that regard.  I have not had an opportunity of going over the wording with the parliamentary draftsman.

      <P>Section 7 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by order, revoke or amend the First Schedule or the Second Schedule.</P>
      <P>This is a very far-reaching power that should not be reserved solely for the Minister.  After all, we must remember that the Minister and this House are delegating powers to the agency to deal with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The First Schedule contains very important provisions.  I will not read it in total but just pick a couple of items therefrom.  Basically the First Schedule sets out activities which will come under the aegis of the agency.  It deals with such matters as the extraction, production and processing of raw asbestos, the manufacture of glass or mineral fibre and so on. I know there was a purpose in compiling these activities.  Indeed that First Schedule lays out the parameters within which <Col N="866" /> the agency should commence their operations. The Minister is reserving to herself power to change these parameters without any reference to the agency.  That is a very bad subsection.  I propose to table an amendment to it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment to this effect tabled by Deputy Gilmore. Perhaps Deputy Garland misunderstands the purpose of this provision.  I would remind Members that an order made to amend the First or Second Schedule, either to make an addition to or remove something from it has to be approved positively by both Houses of the Oireachtas before taking effect.  The Deputy may be concerned as to why a Minister might wish to have power to remove something from the schedule.  In relation to the Second Schedule it could be a case where legislation becomes defunct because it has been replaced by new provisions.  In relation to the First Schedule some activity could have become emission-free and therefore would not require licensing and it would no longer be necessary to keep it as one of the licensing matters for the agency.  It is for that reason that this provision is there. The safeguard is that the order would have to be approved by the House.  In all the circumstances that is reasonable.</P>

    <P>Basically the orders have to be approved where we regard the matters as fundamental to the operation of the agency.  Certainly the administrative and day-to-day matters are not included. Because of the way this House conducts <Col N="867" /> its business it would be virtually impossible, if all regulations had to be positively affirmed by the House, to get anything done.  Because we believe that nothing could be deleted from the First or Second Schedule or that nothing should be added to further burden the agency's work unless it was approved by the Oireachtas, we felt it important to put in a positive affirmation in relation to those matters. The method of selecting the director general and the directors is so fundamental to the independence of the agency that that should not be changed either without the positive approval of the Oireachtas.  I have been informed that there are no other additional matters referred to here.</P>
    <P>Section 7 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1)  Every order or regulation made under this Act shall be published in draft form in a manner to be prescribed, and notice of such publication shall be given in a manner to be prescribed.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any person may comment in a manner to be prescribed upon such draft order or regulation within a time specified in the notice referred to in subsection (1).</P>
      <P>(3)  Any such comments shall be taken into account in making the order or regulation in its final form.</P>
      <P>(4)  The procedure specified in this section shall apply with necessary modifications to the preparation of a draft order under section 7 (3).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert a provision to allow for public comment on regulations.  We had a long discussion <Col N="868" /> on the previous series of amendments in relation to the powers of this House to review, to express a view on, and decide ultimately on regulations that are secondary to primary legislation.  This amendment seeks to broaden the scope of the Bill beyond the range of this House to allow interested members of the public to see draft regulations and to provide a mechanism whereby their comments can be heard.  I am conscious that my amendment might not be perfect in every detail but I am anxious to have the principle accepted by the Minister of State and there will be no difficulty in improving the drafting.  The amendment seeks that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1)  Every order or regulation made under this Act shall be published in draft form in a manner to be prescribed, and notice of such publication shall be given in a manner to be prescribed.</P>
    <P>That is deliberately vague to allow the Minister to draw up the mechanism whereby public notice of regulations could be brought about.  Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of the amendment say:</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person may comment in a manner to be prescribed upon such draft order or regulation within a time specified in the notice referred to in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>(3)  Any such comments shall be taken into account in making the order or regulation in its final form.</P>
    <P>(4)  The procedure specified in this section shall apply with necessary modifications to the preparation of a draft order under section 7 (3).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Basically the mechanism sounds complex but the principle is simple and one which I hope will enjoy wide support in the House.  It is to allow the large number of interested parties who are very concerned about environmental legislation to see draft regulations and to have a say in them.  The end result would be an improvement in the secondary legislative <Col N="869" /> process, whereby people could comment in advance of regulations rather than criticise them when they are enshrined.  I hope the Minister will accept the principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When we began the debate yesterday there was a good deal of legitimate criticism of the length of time it took to get this Bill to this stage. I am concerned that we still have not got this Bill enacted.  I hope we will have it enacted soon.  If we were to go down the road suggested by Deputy Howlin we would add further delays to the effective operation of this agency.  If the Deputy's amendment was accepted even commencement orders would have to be drafted and the draft would have to go for public consultation and so on.  That would lead to untenable delays and to an unnecessary bureaucratic and expensive process that would not have much benefit at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the way this House deals with secondary legislation through regulations and orders must be looked at.  We should look at procedures generally to see how we can improve them in order to perhaps be able to have more meaningful discussions on regulations.  I accept that it is virtually impossible to annul regulations in this House unless parties give their Private Members' time over to it and I do not remember ever having such a debate in this House.  As part of the overall approach to Oireachtas reform to which the Government are committed we need to look at the way in which this House deals with subsidiary legislation. It is not appropriate to add this provision to this Bill as it would have little benefit and would certainly lead to long delays, expense and a lot of red tape and bureaucracy.  Obviously any Minister of the Government consults fairly widely in the drafting of legislation and regulations. Environmental organisations and those concerned with the environment have fairly free access now to Government Ministers, Departmental officials <Col N="870" /> and so on.  It is not as if Ministers and Government operate in a vacuum removed from the outside world.</P>
    <P>There is also a power in the Bill for the agency to give advice, make suggestions on recommendations for regulations to any Minister if they feel it necessary.  I hope the agency will take on board the provisions in the legislation and where necessary will not be shy about making recommendations to the Government or Ministers.  In all the circumstances, on balance, this amendment cannot lead to any great improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response to this reasonable amendment.  I, and I am sure Deputy Howlin, accept that putting this amendment into the Bill would undoubtedly result in some small delays, but I suggest that these would be reasonable delays.  It is very important that we get things right. Rushing at something and then getting it wrong is not the way forward.  Our motto should be to &ldquo;hasten slowly&rdquo;, but not too slowly; one has to strike a balance. However, I believe the balance of advantage lies with Deputy Howlin's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response because she did not address the principle behind the amendment.  Even if the Minister did not accept the mechanism, I thought she would have accepted the principle.  This amendment is based on the principle of openness, which is very basic.  We are critical of the way regulations on legislation are monitored by this House.  I sought to broaden this, to allow the general public to comment on the regulations. A number of agencies in the environmental sphere in particular employ full-time staff and are very concerned about the regulations affecting the environment on foot of this Bill.  They have a right to have their voices heard. It would be more sensible to have their <Col N="871" /> voices heard before the regulations are finalised and are in draft form.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's assertion that this suggestion is of little benefit and that it would be too difficult and cumbersome to implement.  I did not suggest a mechanism and I left it to the Minister to finalise arrangements, but it could be done simply, for example, by a newspaper column listing the regulations available in draft in the Department and inviting those who wish to see them to apply to the Department before a given date.  That is one suggestion but I am sure there are others.  It is a useful way of democratising the way we conduct our business.  I thought the notion of openness and transparency in Government was to be the hallmark of this latest incarnation of the Fianna Fáil-PD Coalition. I believe it would be a good signal by the Minister to say she was willing to allow all the groups and individuals to involve themselves if, they are so minded, in the legislative process by permitting them to comment before the regulations are finalised.</P>

      <P>As I said on a number of occasions, Oireachtas reform is an urgent priority.  We all have to ensure that we reform the Houses of the Oireachtas so that debates are more meaningful.  A great many good suggestions have been made as to how we can reform the Oireachtas to make it more relevant but I do not believe it would be necessary in the context of this Bill to give the public the opportunity to comment on the housekeeping matters such as commencement dates, regulations to allow the agency to operate and so on.  We cannot have it every way.  We cannot criticise the fact that commencement provisions are not satisfactory and at the same time say the procedures must allow for public consultation on every order and regulation, which would lengthen the time considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An advisory committee to the agency will comment on many matters.  It will comprise representatives of environmental organisations among others who have an interest in the work of the agency.  That advisory committee will have specific powers to advise the Minister of the day on environmental issues, <Col N="873" /> on the operation and role of the agency and other matters.  It is not as if people will ignore advice because in my experience there is now fairly widespread consultation with interested groups.</P>
    <P>Earlier today there were calls for the introduction of regulations under the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  There is a great deal of interest in this area and these matters are discussed widely.  It is not as if they grow out of nowhere.  Quite honestly, the difficulties the Deputy has experienced in relation to regulations result more from the way we order our business than from the provisions of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where an offence under this Act is committed by a person acting on behalf of a body corporate but without the knowledge or consent of that body corporate that person shall also be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory.  It was tabled as a result of experiences of persons who acted illegally on behalf of a body corporate not being prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure of the purpose of this amendment.  If it is suggested that a person who acts illegally without the permission or knowledge of a body corporate is not covered by the Act, that is not correct because section 8 (1) clearly specifies:</P>
      <P>Any person who contravenes any provision of this Act or of any regulation made under this Act or of any order made under this Act or of any notice served under this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That covers everybody.  There may have been a misunderstanding that somebody <Col N="874" /> who was not an employee of the agency might not be covered, and if that is the reason for the amendment, the case is covered.  On the other hand, if the purpose of the amendment &mdash; it is not clear from what the Deputy said what its purpose &mdash; is to make a body corporate responsible for the activities of somebody who acted without its knowledge or permission, that is unfair.  If somebody acts in a certain way without the knowledge of some other person or body I do not believe it is appropriate that the other person or body should be held responsible.  That would be grossly unjust.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 8 is to ensure that those who commit an offence, whether acting on their own behalf or in their capacity as a director, manager or whatever of a body corporate, can be found guilty of an offence under this Bill when enacted.  There are no exclusions. All possible cases are covered, with the exception of somebody who acts without the knowledge or consent of the body corporate because somebody or a body corporate cannot be made responsible for the activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point.  The scope of section 8 (1) is particularly wide in that it makes any person who contravenes the provision of the Bill guilty of an offence.  Will Departments of State be included under the provisions of subsection (1)?</P>

      <P>Perhaps we are all getting a little tired towards the end of the day.  I think the Minister has got the wrong end of the stick.  I have read the amendment several times and I should like to read it into the record:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Where an offence under this Act is committed by a person acting on behalf of a body corporate but without the knowledge or consent of that body <Col N="875" /> corporate that person shall also be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seems to cover the person who acted without the authority of the body corporate.  Surely it is reasonable that such a person should be found guilty of an offence.  Perhaps the Minister will say whether this is covered sufficiently in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is covered. Section 8 (1) is so general that it literally includes any person who contravenes any provision of the Act.  Regarding Deputy Howlin's question about a State employee, that is covered in section 3 (5) which states that this Act applies, <i>inter alia,</i> to activities operated by or in the charge of the State.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (1) (a), line 17, to delete &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;twelve&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is essentially a drafting amendment. The purpose is to bring the maximum term of imprisonment for summary offences into line with the provisions of other statutes.  Where consecutive sentences are imposed for two or more offences the court has power to impose up to two years under section 12 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  The deletion of subsection (2) is consequential.  The substitution of 12 months for six months makes it redundant.  Section 13 of the Criminal Procedures Act, 1967 which provides for the summary trial of indictable offences, as amended by section 17 of the 1984 Act, already extends to all summary offences where the maximum fine is £1,000 and the maximum term of imprisonment is 12 months.</P>

One could ask if 12 months is too short a time for some horrendous pollution offences which have been caused by gross carelessness, to say the least.  All the wrong kinds of people are imprisoned, the people who break windows out of desperation and the drug addicts, while the very people who should be in jail, tax evaders, polluters and so forth, are not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support the amendment.  It is very hard to arrive at a figure.  In the case of some of the more serious ecological disasters which have occurred throughout the world in recent years, for example, the destruction of the Alaskan wilderness by oil pollution some years ago, the clean-up bill was tens of millions.  It is a fair conclusion that the fine imposed must be commensurate with the full cost of returning the environment to its original state or a reasonable equivalent.  If, of course, there is wholesale destruction it is not possible to return the environment to the original state.  I do not think any figure set can envisage environmental damage on the scale we have seen in recent times. A serious marine accident would have <Col N="878" /> disastrous consequences for our coastline. To leave it open-ended would be better on the principle that the polluter pays.  The sum of £10 million would be a very severe fine, but for the huge corporations who are guilty of destruction on an unprecedented scale even that level of fine would not be enough to allow the Government or any other agency to restore a damaged wilderness.  For these reasons there is great merit in reflecting on the amendment put forward by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I agree with Deputy Howlin that while £10 million may seem a lot of money it is buttons to some of the very large corporations.  It is better to leave it open-ended.  The only reservation is that in 99 cases out of 100 it is probably a very large fine.  Perhaps this will signal something to the courts and encourage them to fine people very large sums.  I hope the necessity to fine somebody anything approaching £10 million would be very rare.  Nevertheless the balance of advantage lies with leaving it open-ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be disappointed if the Deputy sought to drop the fine of £10 million.  The inclusion of a fine of that level gives the legislation much strength.  The fine is in addition to requirements under the Third Schedule of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act to put a sum of money aside to undo the damage done or to restore the environment if possible.  Perhaps the courts should have regard to the cost of restoring the environment when imposing a fine.  I am keen that the courts should impose tough fines on those convicted of pollution offences.  The courts must assist in making such fines a deterrent to those who would pollute our environment.  I would not be happy about dropping the £10 million provision.  That would give the wrong signal and would be a retrograde step.  It is in line with the fines specified in the legislation dealing with <Col N="879" /> pollution at sea.  I should like to take advice from the Attorney General on the question of requiring the courts to link the fine to the cost of restoring the environment and I will come back to this matter on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to avail of this opportunity to wish the new Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward, every success in his appointment.  His tenure may be short but I wish him every success. This is not only a local issue but a national issue which has grave consequences for the future of primary education in this country.  I have made contact with educationalists on the policy being adopted at present by the Department of Education regarding repeat of sixth class standard in primary schools.  I have been informed that when a pupil is enrolled at the start of the academic year, he or she is validly enrolled for the entire year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drumshanbo national school has been written to by the Department of Education and the board of management in Drumshanbo have been informed there are pupils in the school system who are not validly enrolled.  I understand from the INTO that this is in breach of the <Col N="880" /> agreement which the Department of Education have with the INTO.  If that excuse is to be used by the Department of Education I should like to have it clarified now.</P>
    <P>I have been reliably informed that parents have a constitutional right to send their child to any school they wish until they are 15 years of age.  The policy adopted by the Department of Education is in breach of people's constitutional rights. According to information made available to me that will have serious consequences for the Department of Education.  Will the Minister clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>I have been approached by a number of schools in my constituency concerning this anomaly in the educational system, Scoil Ursula, Sligo; St. Edward's School, Sligo and Drumshanbo national school, County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Many pupils have repeated sixth class since the mid-seventies in Drumshanbo national school.  The Department of Education have stated that the school will lose a teacher because the second sixth class is not taken into consideration.  I am not raising this issue on the grounds of the reduction in the number of teachers at the school but because of the right of children, in the education system, to a decent primary education which would enable them to obtain employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that over the past number of years there have been immense job losses in Drumshanbo.  If the Government are not prepared to give the young people of Drumshanbo a proper education, instead of the penny-pinching policy being adopted, the consequences for people everywhere will be disastrous. I urge the Minister to clarify the matter as quickly as possible because the Department of Education are in breach of an agreement with the INTO and going against the constitutional rights of parents. The people of Drumshanbo have had the right to take on a second sixth class, called 6B, and that should continue.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for his kind remarks and for his contribution on this matter and I am glad to have the opportunity of explaining my Department's position. My Department operate a policy of discounting from valid enrolment pupils who are repeating sixth standard, unless those pupils are repeating for exceptional reasons.  This is clearly outlined in Circular 32/91 which was issued to all boards of management and principal teachers.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the valid enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement on staffing made between the Government and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  In the case of Drumshanbo central national school the valid enrolment of 224 pupils on 30 September, 1991, warrants a staff of principal plus six assistants for the 1992-93 school year.  The school will also have the services of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>My Department sought a report from the district inspector in order to determine the staffing arrangement in the school for the 1992-93 school year.  The inspector's report drew attention to 12 pupils who were repeating sixth standard in the school.  These pupils are being taught by the principal teacher, and follow a curriculum geared towards first year post-primary.  All 12 pupils are repeating at their parents' request.  Pupils repeating sixth standard at their parents' request are not considered by the Department as coming within the exceptional circumstances referred to in Circular 32/91.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report stated that the school facilitated these requests not on the basis of need but because, in the absence of any clear guidelines in the Rules and Regulations of National Schools, there was no official reason to refuse this request, the <Col N="882" /> school facilitates any request from parents for the additional year in school.</P>
    <P>The post of seventh assistant in the school is to be discontinued with effect from 31 August 1992, as the valid enrolment figure of 224 does not warrant its retention.  The 12 pupils who are repeating sixth standard in the school have been discounted from the enrolment on 30 September, 1991.  The most junior assistant in the school will be given the option of redeployment to another national school in the diocese of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise from 1 September, 1992 by means of the diocesan panel.</P>
    <P>The status of these 12 pupils is crucial to the staffing arrangements.  Their inclusion in the valid enrolment which would give a figure of 236, would result in the retention of the post of seventh assistant for the 1992-93 school year, while their exclusion brings the valid enrolment down to 224, resulting in the post being discontinued with effect from 31 August 1992.</P>
    <P>My Department have written to the chairperson of the board of management. Very Rev. Canon T. McHale, Parish Priest, regarding the enrolment of pupils in a repeat sixth class, and drawing the attention of the board to the regulations in respect of repeat pupils.  Canon McHale has been informed that these pupils were to be discounted from the valid enrolment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with disbelief I heard the Department of Health had instructed the board of St. James's Hospital, Dublin to build another incinerator, following all the problems associated with existing incinerators, to burn not merely their clinical waste but the clinical waste <Col N="883" /> of all the city hospitals.  The present Minister is a medical practitioner by profession and practised in the area where it is proposed to locate this massive new incinerator.  I appeal to him not to inflict this project on the people living in the surrounding areas, such as Rialto, Dolphin's Barn, Maryland etc.</P>
      <P>How in the name of God could anyone suggest that a hospital site, such as St. James's Hospital, given the number of people who attend the hospital either as in-patients, out-patients or day patients in addition to the number of visitors to the hospital each day and the number of staff, should be chosen as the location for the central clinical waste dump for all the hospitals in Dublin?  The proposed project is more like an industrial operation which would be more suited to an industrial estate rather than the grounds of the city's busiest hospital which is surrounded by residential areas.  How, for example, will we be able to prevent pollution in relation to the quality of the atmosphere?  How many vans and trucks will trundle in and out of the hospital each day carrying waste from the other hospitals?  What about the noxious effects on people living in the surrounding areas caused by the burning of PVCs?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the basic problem of medical waste is a biological one?  We are anxious to destroy the bugs that can spread disease.  Under most circumstances a high temperature incinerator is going to take that problem in its stride but only at the expense of creating several formidable chemical ones because incineration not only takes on the problem of destroying bugs, it takes on the more daunting task of destroying plastics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When plastics are burned several things can happen.  First, any metal, such as the toxic metal cadmium which is often added to plastics as either a pigment or as a stabiliser, will be liberated from the otherwise stable plastic matrix as the <Col N="884" /> plastic is burned away.  The metals &mdash; indestructible by any burning or other chemical process &mdash; emerge from the stack as gases, tiny particles that can penetrate deep down into the lungs or are captured in the air pollution control devices and leave the facility either in the waste water or the fly ash.</P>
    <P>Second, many plastic objects used in hospitals, like intravenous tubing, are made of polyvinyl chloride, PVC, which contains 58 per cent by weight of chlorine. Chlorine, too, is an element and cannot be destroyed.  The best that can happen is that it forms hydrochloric acid which is probably the orgin of the frequent complaints of respiratory problems and eye soreness from citizens living near incinerators without acid scrubbers.</P>
    <P>I have one specific request to make of the Minister.  I ask him to allow the public and their public representatives to participate before he goes ahead with this project to ensure that a decision is taken only after there has been such full debate. That is the least that the public, particularly the communities living in the surrounding areas in this case, are entitled to.  I hope the Minister will announce that this is his intention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  This issue is the source of widespread concern in the communities living in the areas surrounding St. James's Hospital, in particular Kilmainham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only too well aware of the very serious problems which have been caused by the incineration of hospital waste in the middle of heavily populated areas, particularly in the areas where many elderly people live.  I live in and represent communities which are affected by emissions of pollutants from incinerator chimneys at the Mater Hospital and Temple <Col N="885" /> Street Hospital.  The complaints which have been made by residents there are identical to the complaints which have been made by those affected by the existing incinerator at St. James's Street Hospital.  They complain of heavy, black and noxious emissions &mdash; this is quite significant &mdash; which occur mainly during the night and in the early hours of the morning.  Elderly people have been severely affected, particularly those with respiratory complaints.  They have become prisoners in their own homes and have been forced to keep doors and windows tightly closed when the incinerator is being used and for hours afterwards.</P>
    <P>Hospitals, including St. James's Hospital, have already been prosecuted and fined by the courts in respect of breaches of the Air Pollution Acts.  I put it to the Minister that it is ironic that Dublin's leading hospitals are actually damaging the health of people living nearby by incinerating hospital waste which causes severe air pollution.  Is it not incredible that Governments spend millions of pounds restoring public buildings which have been damaged by air pollution and refuse to pay for essential alternative methods for the safe disposal of hospital waste?</P>
    <P>What is at issue here is the proposal to locate the new central incinerator at St. James's Hospital to dispose of the waste produced at all Dublin hospitals but this would make what is already an intolerable situation unbearable for the residents living in surrounding areas and indeed in the entire city centre.  This proposal must be scrapped.  The people will not accept it.  Alternative methods are available to transport waste out of the city centre to an industrial area where it could be disposed of.  May I ask the Minister if he is already considering alternatives as I understand certain proposals have been put to him?  May I also ask him if he will meet a deputation from the local residents' committees to hear their views on the issue?  I am confident that <Col N="886" /> he would be deeply impressed by them as indeed I was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to respond tonight to the very important issue raised by Deputy Byrne and Deputy Gregory. First, I should explain that my Department's technical officers have been examining for some time a number of options for the disposal of hospital waste, including clinical waste, with a view to arriving at the most economic and environmentally acceptable solution.  The policy of the hospital authorities is that hospital waste should be segregated into infected and non-infected categories, with the infected waste being incinerated and non-infected waste being sent for disposal by deep burial at tipheads.  The two main methods of disposal currently are incineration and burial at tipheads.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that hospitals, by the nature of the medical treatments which are performed in them, will produce waste which is bacteriologically dangerous and, so, must be made safe. The best method of rendering such infectious waste harmless is to raise it to a temperature which will destroy all living organisms.  This has traditionally been done in the hospital incinerator.  There is no way of avoiding the production of infectious waste from hospitals and so the challenge is to render it safe while not causing pollution.  This can be done but it cannot be done cheaply or overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticisms have been made from time to time in relation to the arrangements currently in force for the disposal of hospital waste.  Some of these criticisms relate to the use of incinerators which are alleged to be defective or inadequate. Many of the hospital incinerators currently in use have been stated to be incapable of reaching the required temperatures for efficient operation.  I accept that many of these criticisms are in fact justified.  The fact is that many of our hospital incinerators are not geared to <Col N="887" /> the level of performance required to meet today's rigorous standards on a continuous basis.  These standards are becoming more demanding year by year in response to society's increasing concern for the environment.</P>
    <P>Because of the inability of many of our individual hospital incinerators to meet the required standard my Department consider that the most cost effective and environmentally acceptable solution to the problem appears to be the provision of large centralised incinerators to cater for more than one hospital.  A proposal to establish a central incinerator at St. James's Hospital to cater for the clinical waste from all the Dublin hospitals is well advanced.  This equipment will consist of mechanical loading, primary combustion chamber to 800 degrees centigrade, secondary combustion chamber to 1,200 degrees centigrade, heat recovery boiler, flue gas scrubbing system, filtration and monitoring of flue gas emissions.</P>
    <P>The cost of such a system is such that it could not be provided on each hospital site.  Therefore it has been decided to centralise on one hospital site, St. James's Hospital.  Tenders are currently being examined from operators who would supply, install and operate such a system together with the collection and transport service from the other Dublin hospitals.  The material will be transported in sealed boxes in dedicated closed vans.</P>
    <P>Some of the arguments in favour of a central incinerator are as follows: first, the cost of scrubbing, filtration and monitoring on each hospital site would be totally prohibitive, second, heat recovery is possible and valuable, third 24 hour operation is possible leading to cleaner operation and a smaller incinerator and fourth, better management and supervision is possible.</P>
    <P>The considerations influencing the choice of St. James's Hospital as the site for a central incinerator for the Dublin hospitals include the following: a building <Col N="888" /> 45 metres high with flues and site road network is already there; St. James's Hospital has a large requirement for heat.  An annual saving of £90,000 is possible on the present fuel bill and St. James's Hospital itself is one of the largest producers of clinical waste.</P>
    <P>I would like to allay the understandable concern of the local residents in relation to this incinerator.  When tenders have been evaluated an environmental impact study, required under EC Directive 85/337, will be completed by Eolas. Subject to a positive finding and approval by St. James's board, planning permission and a licence under the Air Pollution Act will be sought from Dublin Corporation.  This planning process will meet the request from Deputy Byrne who referred to the need to allow the public express their views on this proposal.</P>
    <P>The full planning process will be gone through even though, as the Deputy probably knows, this may not have been necessary under the consultation process between one statutory agency and another.  In this case the full planning process will be gone through; that involves the planning application, the rights of the local residents, as referred to by Deputy Byrne and Deputy Gregory, to be heard, and the whole process right up to An Bord Pleanála to be gone through.  That will allow people to express their view on this project.</P>
    <P>It must also be remembered that there have been many complaints about the operation of the present hospital incinerator. The proposal for a central incinerator to operate to the highest environmental standards is seen as a green initiative to improve the present situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputy Byrne for raising this important question.  I know that other Deputies, including Deputy Gregory, are also concerned about this issue and I assure the House that every effort is being made by my Department to implement a hospital waste disposal <Col N="889" /> policy which will overcome the difficulties associated with current practices and fully comply with the demanding requirements of modern environmental and other standards.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister for the Environment make available a grant to the central group water scheme, Farmer's Bridge, Tralee, to start phase 5 of the scheme to take a water supply to Kielduff, Tralee?</P>
      <P>There are 46 houses which need a water connection in this area which is made up mainly of farmers, a hotel, chalets near the hotel and a number of guesthouses.  Many of those householders are getting water from Tralee which is about five miles from them.  The hotel and chalet owner has to transport water twice a day during the summer from Tralee.  The water in the Kielduff area contains iron and the Minister for the Environment, who is a farmer, understands that the water cannot be used for domestic purposes.  It is essential that phase 5 of this group water scheme goes ahead as it is badly needed by the residents in the area.  The cost to the Department of the Environment would be only £30,000.</P>
      <P>It cost £26 million to bring a water supply from Killarney to Tralee where there was a serious shortage of water. This water supply would serve Kielduff. It is important to make money available to extend that water supply by way of a group scheme to Kielduff, Tralee.  I appeal to the Minister to make £30,000 available for extending the water supply to this area.</P>

      <P>The Farmer's Bridge group is one of the most ambitious in the country.  It is part of an investment programme for County Kerry which covers not only extensive water supply but a fast developing waste water treatment element. <Col N="890" /> Between 1987 and 1991 over £21 million was spent by the Government in providing new and improved water and sewerage schemes.  Most of the central regional water supply scheme is already in place following the recent completion of stage 8.  Sewerage schemes for Killarney, Listowel, Castleisland and Ballybunion are either complete or under construction and plans are being prepared for coastal sewerage schemes at Tralee, Cahirciveen, Dingle, Killorglin and Kenmare.</P>
      <P>The Farmer's Bridge scheme, which is being developed in five phases, will serve up to 1,100 households and farms when fully completed.  It will provide a major part of the infill for the Kerry central regional water supply scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme traverses the heartland of the regional scheme.  Accordingly, the trunk main networks require costly upsizing to regional scheme specification in order to comply with Kerry County Council's long term plans for the region.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the development of the scheme is proceeding on a phased basis because of the size and complexity of the project and the limited resources of the group water scheme programme. Phases 1 and 2 are almost complete and serve over 600 houses and farms.  State grants of £900,000 have been paid to date.</P>
      <P>Phase 3 was recently allocated grants of over £500,000.  This phase will extend the public water supply to over 250 households and farms as well as providing an alternative water supply to Abbeydorney and Kilflynn.  This will eliminate water quality problems in those areas. Work is progressing satisfactorily on phase 3 and is expected to be completed in the current year.  Grant payments to date amount to £204,500.  The balance of £309,000 will be paid according as work progresses on the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of phases 4 and 5 will substantially complete the overall scheme and will extend piped water <Col N="891" /> supplies to a further 300 households in the Kielduff, Lahern and Doon areas.</P>
    <P>The design for the remaining phases has been approved by Kerry County Council and my Department.  The cost of completing both schemes to regional scheme specification is under examination at present and is provisionally estimated at almost £600,000.</P>
    <P>I cannot be definite at this stage about <Col N="892" /> when it may be possible to approve grants for phases 4 and 5.  We are still involved in financing phase 3 and as the Deputy will know, there are many other pressing commitments around the country.  I will, however, bear in mind the very forceful points made by Deputy McEllistrim about the urgency of phase 5.</P>

      <P>It is a basic condition for receipt of an unemployment payment that a claimant must be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work. In general, full-time attendance by day at a course of education is not regarded as being consistent with being available for employment.

      <P>Students engaged in full-time studies may become part of the labour force on completion of their studies or after the end of their academic year in May or June.

      <P>Substitute payments arise where applicants are paid supplementary welfare allowance pending determination of their entitlement to a social welfare benefit or allowance.  These payments are a very important part of the provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme as they ensure that immediate need is met.</P>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is an internal Eastern Health Board report which relates to the Dublin West area.  Statistics available to my Department for the country as a whole indicate that the number of substitute payments made in the last week in March 1991 was some 8,500, an increase of some 1,400 on the previous year.  This must be seen in the context of an increase in the number of weekly social welfare payments in the period of over 33,000.</P>
      <P>My Department's objective is to provide an improved and speedier service for social welfare clients and to reduce the need for recourse to substitute payments. A number of measures have been introduced which have been designed to reduce claim processing times throughout my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for unemployment payments represent some 70 per cent of all substitute payments in the Eastern Health Board area.  New measures <Col N="820" /> designed to simplify and expedite the determination of claims for unemployment assistance in cases where applicants' means can be easily established include the extension of desk interviewing in place of home visits.  Such measures will reduce the duration of substitute payment claims and in some cases eliminate entirely the need for such payments.</P>
    <P>A liaison group has been established between the Eastern Health Board and my Department's local management. This group has paid particular attention to the issue of substitute payments, including improving contacts at local level between Eastern Health Board community welfare officers, who make the substitute payments, and my Department's local offices.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, a study group was established in October 1991 to examine the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the Eastern Health Board area and to make recommendations for improved mechanisms and procedures. The group is due to report shortly and I will be giving their proposals immediate consideration.  I will be particularly concerned to identify and implement further measures which can be taken to avoid unnecessary recourse to substitute payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

This includes information on pensions, child benefit and treatments benefit claims handled at my Department's decentralised offices at Sligo and Letterkenny. <Col N="822" /> The range of services available to the public at local information offices is currently being extended so that, in time, most social welfare claims will be dealt with locally.</P>
      <P>Members of the public wishing to contact the decentralised offices directly can do so either by ringing Sligo or Letterkenny or, if it is cheaper, by ringing my Department's headquarters in Dublin.  Under the current arrangements, all members of the public can still contact the Department for the same cost as prior to decentralisation.  In addition, however, people in the North-West can contact the Department at a lesser cost by ringing the Sligo or Letterkenny office directly.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements provide a satisfactory level of service to the public throughout the country and represent an improvement on the situation that obtained prior to decentralisation. I have no plans to introduce any additional general local call facility.</P>

      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency undertakes a range of activities and research aimed at overcoming poverty, including poverty in rural areas. The agency's work in the period 1990-92 is focused around four main themes, namely access to income, unemployment, access to services and opportunities and community development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1992 the agency will continue to give high priority to rural poverty. In particular it will continue to co-fund, support and evaluate the FORUM project in North West Connemara.  This is <Col N="823" /> a major pilot project in the Third EC Poverty Programme.  It involves the statutory agencies and local community interests working in partnership in identifying and addressing the needs of the area.  FORUM has already undertaken important research into rural poverty.  It has also instigated a range of practical programmes for the elderly, women, young people, the unemployed and underemployed in the area.  The total funding for the project is of the order of £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>The agency will also develop further support and training for the community development projects funded under my Department's Community Development Programme.  Six of the projects currently funded under the programme are in rural areas and a number of new rural projects will be set up under the programme in 1992.  The agency also plans to develop support programmes for women's groups and particularly women's groups in disadvantaged rural areas.  In regard to research the agency plans to give high priority in 1992 to research into rural poverty.  During the year the agency plans to commission a companion volume to its report on urban poverty which will deal specifically with the issue of rural poverty.</P>

      <P>The officers of the External Control Unit of my Department already operate under strict guidelines which include a code of conduct for dealing with members of the public.  The guidelines and training of officers are designed to ensure that interviews are conducted in <Col N="824" /> a dignified and orderly manner with as little inconvenience as possible to individuals or other members of the public.</P>
      <P>Officers have been instructed to ensure that all clients are treated with tact and courtesy and all questions must be relevant to determining if the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments are understood and met; no undue delays or inconvenience are to result from their operations.  When operating on wet days their activities should not result in clients queuing in the rain; clients are advised of the purpose of the interview, and are told about any reports alleging abuse by them of the social welfare system where this might occasionally arise; suitable accommodation is used to ensure client privacy, when in-depth interviewing takes place; and when attending at Garda stations and signing centres, they prominently display signs identifying the unit so that the clients know to whom they are speaking.</P>
      <P>The work of the Internal Control Unit of my Department is one measure to help ensure that abuse of the system is eliminated.  The unit exists to stamp out abuse and people genuinely unemployed have no need for concern.</P>

      <P>Subsequent to their prosecution by the Garda for illegal casual trading, the persons in question had their entitlements to unemployment assistance reviewed by my Department.  Decisions on entitlement to all social welfare payments are made by independent deciding officers or in the event of appeal by independent appeals officers.  I am satisfied that no influence was brought to bear on the officers who decided the entitlements of the persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When investigating entitlement to <Col N="825" /> social welfare payments or any alleged abuse of the system the deciding authorities must evaluate all information available from whatever source in any particular case.  Before a decision is given, however, the claimant would be given an opportunity to comment fully on, <i>inter alia,</i> any allegations which would affect his/her entitlement.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office is independent of my Department and appeals officers have authority to summon any person to attend a hearing for the purpose of giving evidence and ensuring a fair decision.</P>
    <P>There were two persons mentioned in the details supplied with the question. In one case, the person's unemployment assistance was temporarily disallowed as a consequence of his failing to make himself available for interview to an inspector of the Department in the course of the review of his claim.  Payment has since been allowed.  In the case of the second individual, his payment was disallowed but was restored on appeal at a reduced level.</P>

      <P>A deciding officer assessed the means of the person concerned at £30 per week from 14 January 1991.  The means are derived from self-employment as a handyman.  The deciding officer took the view that the person concerned could reasonably expect to enjoy the same opportunities for self-employment as he had experienced in the preceding year and assessed his income accordingly.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed against this decision to the independent appeals office and, following an oral hearing of his case on 15 October 1991, an appeals officer upheld the deciding officer's decision.  This assessment entitled the person concerned to payment at the weekly rate of £20 which, in this case, is the maximum short term rate for unemployment assistance less means.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned feels that his present circumstances have substantially changed, it is open to him to re-apply for unemployment assistance, when his situation will be reinvestigated.</P>

      <P>The total anticipated saving from the proposed measures was some £9 million in 1992.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposals regarding the transfer of responsibility for sickness payments to employers, officials of my Department have met on two occasions with the Federation of Irish Employers to discuss the proposals.  Initial discussions have also been held with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and further discussions will take place.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commits the Government to ongoing reform of the social welfare system broadly within the framework outlined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The proposed measures in relation to disability benefit are in line with this policy; the commission was in favour of the taxation of such benefits. I would also point out that the budget package announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, provided for an increase of 6 per cent in disability benefit. This is well above the rate of inflation and therefore represents a real improvement in the living standards of people dependent on disability benefit.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available.  While certain data on the composition of inflows to the live register is being compiled by my Department, it is not possible to compile data on the reasons underlying outflows. The live register monthly flow analysis published by the Central Statistics Office gives data on outflows. These data are derived from the stock and inflow data.  There are a number <Col N="829" /> of reasons people sign off the register including securing employment, return to home duties, emigration etc.  It is not possible for my Department to differentiate between these groups or to provide outflow data by duration of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I am of course concerned that the long term unemployed should be facilitated in every way in obtaining employment. While training and job creation are of course outside the ambit of my Department, we have a variety of initiatives in place designed to help the long term unemployed by allowing them to attend courses of education at second and third level and still receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments. These initiatives derive from the results of surveys which indicate that there is a link between being long term unemployed and poor educational attainments.</P>

      <P>The tax clearance scheme which is being applied gradually to livestock headage grants in disadvantaged areas relates to public grants and subsidies.  The payments by the Department of Education to assistant examiners are not grants or <Col N="835" /> subsidies and therefore these tax clearance procedures do not apply.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Department of Education that the payments to assistant examiners are for services. There is a second tax clearance scheme which applies to public sector contracts including contracts for services.  Under this scheme companies or individuals applying for public sector contracts valued at £5,000 or over must produce a current tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners before the contract is awarded.  However, the Department of Education have indicated that no assistant examiner has been paid £5,000 or more.  It follows, therefore, that none of these examiners comes within the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education have indicated that an RSI number for each examiner is needed by them, as this number is used by the Department as a reference number under which all data about payments, PAYE/PRSI deductions, and personal data such as name, address, date of birth, experience, etc., are stored.  The RSI number is required by the Department therefore to reference this information, and is essential if PAYE and PRSI contributions are to be deducted at the correct rate applicable to each individual examiner.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of capital acquisitions tax payable on a gift is a function of the value of the property gifted, the aggregation, where relevant, of prior benefits taken by the beneficiary and the relationship of the disponer to the beneficiary.  In the absence of full details of prior benefits and of the value of the property in question, it is not possible to state the actual liability, if any, which might arise.</P>
      <P>The current threshold for purposes of a benefit taken from a stranger is £11,090. Where this threshold is exceeded, the following rates of capital acquisitions tax apply to the excess:</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the details supplied by the Deputy refer to two separate tax years.  The taxpayer received the full lone parent allowance of £2,179 from the Department of Social Welfare in the year ended 5 April 1991.  She was accordingly assessed on this amount for that year. Her liability for 1990-91 was reviewed on 28 May 1991 and no refund arose.  The lone parent allowance which she received in the period from 6 April to 6 May 1991 will be assessed in the tax year ended 5 April 1992.</P>

    <P>*The series for energy products excluding electricity covers the following items: coal and anthracite, turf and briquettes, bottled gas, piped gas, central heating oil, motor fuel, motor oil and firelighters.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will note that there was an increase in the index series for the energy products category and a lesser increase in the electricity series over the period.  However, since both increases were less than the inflation rate over the same period as measured by the overall consumer price index, it can be concluded that there was a decrease, in real terms, in prices in both categories; a decrease of 10.4 per cent for electricity and of 3.5 per cent for other fuels.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for coast protection rests with maritime local authorities, some of which have undertaken protection work themselves.  Owners of private property have, of course, a role in protecting their own interests.  The policy of my Department is to facilitate the implementation of permanent schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.  To this end my Department during 1991 requested each maritime local authority to submit priorities for coast protection works.  My Department are also exploring all possibilities for securing EC funding under a number of environmental programmes.</P>

    <P>The following is an outline of specific works undertaken in 1991 &mdash; new capital works undertaken in 1991: the Maharees Peninsula, County Kerry; Strandhill, County Sligo; Rosslare Strand, County Wexford; Arklow, County Wicklow, balance of grant aid for the north beach scheme at Arklow undertaken during the previous year; further necessary studies <Col N="841" /> in connection with the preparation of a major scheme for Bray, County Wicklow and maintenance of the existing coast protection works at Rosslare and other schemes undertaken in accordance with the Coast Protection Act, 1963.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that those engaged in illegal broadcasting activities do not notify the Department of their activities.  At the time the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 came into force on 31 December 1988 my Department estimated that of the order of 70 illegal radio stations were operating.  A similar number was probably operating in 1985.  My Department have reason to believe that currently there are of the order of 18 illegal broadcasting stations operating, either full time or part time at various locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable time and resources have been devoted to tackling the illegal broadcasting problem.  Extensive monitoring, investigations and six search and seize operations against illegal broadcasters were carried out in 1990-91.  Seven <Col N="845" /> prosecutions have been initiated in the courts and evidence in one other case is being examined by the Chief State Solicitor to determine if a further prosecution can be brought.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department have placed advertisements in local papers and written to persons and businesses who advertise on illegal stations making it clear that it is an offence to advertise on such stations.  I understand that as a result there has been a considerable drop in advertising revenue going to illegal stations.</P>
    <P>Since the coming into force of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 court convictions have been secured against individuals associated with four illegal redio stations and fines totalling £675 have been imposed.  Collection of the fines is a matter for the courts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The formal designation of beds arises from the legislation enacted in 1991 to give effect to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitments to improve equity of access to public hospitals.  As part of the designation process, hospitals were required to identify the numbers of beds which were, on 31 May last, regarded as public, private or in categories where a distinction between public and private accommodation did not arise.  Proposals for the formal designation of these beds were then agreed between the health boards or voluntary hospitals and the Department of Health, based on an analysis of the respective levels of public and private activity.  I have approved these proposals on the basis that they will be subject to regular review in the light of my Department's monitoring of the operation of the new arrangements.</P>
      <P>The following table compares the approved designations with the breakdowns identified by the hospitals in respect of 31 May 1991.</P>

    <P>*Non-designated beds are those where a distinction between public and private accommodation will not arise.</P>
    <P>As comparable information was not previously compiled it is not possible to provide the details sought for earlier periods.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that these figures are not directly comparable with the figures published annually in respect of the total number of acute public hospital <Col N="848" /> beds.  Certain psychiatric and geriatric beds which, although located in acute hospitals, are not counted in the latter figures, are included in the designation exercise because they cater for private as well as public patients.  On the other hand, the designation exercise excludes a small number of acute public hospitals in which there is no significant private activity.</P>
    <P>While, as already stated, a total comparable with that in the designation exercise cannot be provided for earlier periods, I would refer the Deputy to my predecessor's reply to his question of 16 October 1991 which sets out the total number of acute public hospital beds for each year to 1990.  These figures are based on final annualised returns, and the equivalent figure for 1991 is not yet available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The built-up area speed limit of 30 mph applies to all roads in built-up areas in county boroughs, urban districts and towns with town commissioners.  That speed limit is applied directly through section 45 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. For roads outside of such areas, the speed limit of 55 mph generally applies. However, local speed limit regulations made by the Minister for the Environment can apply the 30 mph limit to roads in areas other than &ldquo;built up areas&rdquo;, remove that limit from particular roads, or apply special speed limits (40 mph/50 mph) where appropriate.  Although these local limits must be prescribed in regulations, <Col N="850" /> the practice is for local authorities, in conjunction with the Garda, to recommend proposals to me and it is the policy to implement these proposals as far as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for a number of schemes of support for voluntary and community groups which are funded from the national lottery. Allocations under these schemes are not made on a county basis.  They depend on the number and nature of the applications received, with priority for areas of greatest disadvantage.  Allocations are made following consultations with the relevant health boards, where appropriate, and discussions with the voluntary and community based groups involved.</P>
      <P>Details of grants approved in the MidWestern, Southern and Western health board areas are as follows:</P>
      <P>Mid-Western Health Board, £46,980 &mdash; 7 under the scheme of Grants to Voluntary Bodies, £19,530; 17 under the scheme of Grants for locally-based Women's Groups, £27,450.</P>
      <P>Southern Health Board, £135,450 &mdash; 25 under the scheme for locally-based Voluntary Bodies, £102,900; 32 under the Scheme of Grants for locally-based Women's Groups, £32,550.</P>
      <P>Western Health Board, £145,650 &mdash; 13 under the scheme of Grants to Voluntary Bodies, £94,280; 41 under the scheme of grants for locally-based Women's Groups, £51,370</P>
