      <Quest>if he will elaborate on his recent statement that Irish neutrality is no longer relevant; if he intends to arrange the publication of a White Paper on this matter, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my recent address to the Institute for European Affairs, to which I assume the Deputy alludes, that the policy and tradition of neutrality in the military sense has served Ireland well, has been an undoubted source of pride and is something to which many Irish people remain idealistically attached.  Neutrality has served as a symbol of sovereignty and independence, and it was, especially during the Second World War, of great practical consequence, in sparing this country from the ravages of war.  In more recent decades it has been pursued pragmatically, and it has helped us to play a constructive role in UN peacekeeping and develop fruitful political and economic relations with countries of the Third World, to which we have never presented a threat. Neutrality did not prevent us from becoming a member of the European Community in 1972.  The wisdom of that decision is clear from the fact that 20 years on so many other neutral countries in Europe now also wish to join the Community.</P>
      <P>I went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...we have to recognise how much circumstances have changed.  The world of mutually antagonistic alliances, which gave neutrality its relevance, has gone.  In the new era, we have a chance to build, with the other countries of Europe, a new positive framework for security, which will reflect and incorporate much more, the ideals that we have held all along, than any type of obsolete Cold War thinking.... It is right that we should join with the other countries in Europe in exploring new policies and frameworks for peace and security, and we can do so in a spirit of evolution and continuity without doing violence to our traditions. There is no sense in adopting an isolationism, that will cut us off from the rest of Europe, and there is very little we could achieve for world peace and development from such a position. We would be of little interest to nonaligned and development countries, if <Col N="264" /> we were not a sympathetic member of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I also said, on the question of a common defence policy:</P>
    <P>...What the Treaty provides for is further discussions and negotiations on such a policy and for another Intergovernmental Conference in 1996, but it does not itself set up a common defence policy.  We have accepted these provisions in line with our longstanding commitment to our partners that in the event of full political union, we would accept the obligations, even if these included defence.  We have never ruled out the possibility of the Community's developing eventually and in stages a stronger security and defence dimension, and we will enter into any future negotiations in good faith.</P>
    <P>I emphasised that the outcome of these negotiations would have to be agreed unanimously and would be put to the Irish people for a decision.</P>
    <P>I said that the suggestion that ratification of the Treaty on European Union would mean that another referendum on a common defence policy would not be required here seemed to be based on a very narrow interpretation of one part of the 1987 decision of the Supreme Court. The suggestion ignores the finding of the court that the State does not have an open-ended authority to agree, without further amendment of the Constitution, to amendments of the Treaties.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat now, clearly and emphatically, that the Irish people will be consulted and will have an opportunity to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any future Treaty, establishing a common defence policy or common defence for the Union.  I should add that any referendum on this issue would, of course, involve the publication of a White Paper.  However, that is for the future, when we will have to take account of many developments, including the end of the Cold War, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact, relations between the United States and the Community, the situation about <Col N="265" /> Europe's periphery, the proud record of participation by this country in UN peace-keeping forces in no less than 17 different countries throughout the world, and the new structures for peace and security being developed, for example, in the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.</P>
    <P>I cannot say what the outcome of these different developments will be in 1996, and I doubt if the Deputy can, but I can assure him and this House that it will be for the Irish people to judge then, in the light of circumstances then, where their future in this whole area lies.  The present referendum will not commit them one way or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach's address to the Institute for European Affairs was the first statement of major significance from the Government on the issue of neutrality, will he agree that the Government should consider publishing an interim White Paper at least on the ramifications of this change in policy by the Government which, as he said, served this country well and in which there has been pride?</P>
      <P>At this juncture could the Taoiseach outline, given the inevitability of the direction we are pursuing in the lead up to 1996, the role he envisages the Irish State will play?  For example, does he envisage Ireland taking part in NATO or in the Western European Union?  Could the Taoiseach give some indication of the direction we are taking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that we will not be participants in NATO and that we will not become a full member of the Western European Union.  There are nine members of the Western European Union.  Ireland, with the other members, was invited at the time of the Maastrict European Council to become a member. As I said, we do not intend to become a member of the Western European Union.  We believe there are advantages in our attending Western European Union meetings as an observer if and when the necessity arises, as we will <Col N="266" /> determine.  That is the position and that will remain the position.  However, if and when the need arises, in 1996, or thereabouts, for the publication of a White Paper, if there are changed circumstances then, we will be able to assess the situation for the Irish people.  The Irish people will decide at the end of the day, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from what the Taoiseach said that the Government have formally refused the invitation offered by the Western European Union and that as of now that formal response has been in the negative, that we are not joining the Western European Union? Secondly, may I again suggest to the Taoiseach that it would be in everybody's interest, given the major shift in this policy area &mdash; a policy that has served Ireland well through the decades &mdash; to at least publish an interim White Paper in order to allow constructive debate to take place, notwithstanding the view that matters will not come to a head until 1996?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the necessity for an interim White Paper, as the Deputy suggests.  I have laid out the position clearly and unequivocally in the House; we do not intend to become a member of the Western European Union and we will not involve ourselves in any type of defence structures that would involve NATO.  I have made that position abundantly clear.  If and when there is a change by the other member states, by 1996 or thereafter, the Irish people will at the end of the day have to make the decision &mdash;&ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  In the meantime, any changes must be unanimous and discussions must be unanimous.  We do not intend to become a full member of Western European Union.  We will continue to be observers, as we have been in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach confirm that this country is not neutral in the strict sense in that we do not conform to the principles of neutrality as laid down in international law under the Paris and Hague Conventions and that what we now call neutrality is no more than a continuing decision on the part of our country not to become a member of a military alliance?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the position in relation to the Western European Union?  There was an invitation to become either a member or an observer and I know we attended some meetings on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Has it been decided to attend all meetings as an observer or will <i>ad hoc</i> decisions be made from meeting to meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it abundantly clear that we do not intend to become a member of the Western European Union but that we do, however, recognise advantages in our attending Western European Union meetings as an observer, as we did on a couple of occasions.  The status of observer does not require Ireland to become a member of the Western European Union or to take on any obligations or defence commitments under the Western European Union Treaty.  That is our clear position. Any changes in national policy that may evolve in 1996 or thereafter will be a matter for decision by the Irish people by referendum.  Until then, nothing happens without unanimity of the members concerned and that is our full protection.  At the end of the day if there is any proposal to change our position in relation to defence and security the Irish people will have their say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek a point of clarification. Has a decision been made to <Col N="268" /> accept observer status on a continuing basis, as opposed to the original <i>ad hoc</i> decision?  I believe we should, but has that decision been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy has been listening but I have already said that we do not intend to become a member of the Western European Union and that our taking up of observer status, as we have taken up in the past, does not require us to become a member of Western European Union. That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach raised a range of issues in his reply.  It is important that the House be able to debate those issues at greater length than is available in a question and answer session across the floor of the House.  Would the Taoiseach say whether he expects the position of the other 11 member states in 1996 will be bestowed on Ireland by the Holy Ghost in some way or that there will be an evolution of a position between now and 1996?  Does he not accept that we therefore need to have a statement of the Government's position and the principles on which they will approach the development of a defence capacity for the European Community?  It is not good enough to simply say that we are not a member and we are not going to join but we may have to make a decision in 1996.  No doubt, in 1996, we shall be told, &ldquo;Vote &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or we will be driven out of the Community.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's interpretation is designed to mislead the public.  The position is quite clear; there is nothing in the treaty we are signing that commits us for the future.  It is likely that there will be another intergovernmental conference on this issue in <Col N="269" /> 1996.  Nothing can change in the meantime without unanimity.  That is our full protection in this regard.  No change will take place at that stage without a referendum being held.  The Deputy should understand that position and should not try to distract people away from the true position.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach give the House a clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to this question: have we communicated a refusal to become a full member of the Western European Union to other members of the Community? Upon what basis does the Taoiseach make the statement contained in the reply he gave to the House this afternoon, and also in the speech to the Institute of European Affairs, in which he refers to &ldquo;mutually antagonistic alliances that gave neutrality its relevance&rdquo;. Is the Taoiseach suggesting that neutrality has no relevance following the collapse of the Soviet Union or that it had no relevance before the Cold War?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach made a very good case for our policy of neutrality in the past.  He stated &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that it served us very well in the past.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he has not made a case for change; rather what he is talking about is short term expediency and complacency.  Furthermore, he seems to think, because all things in the garden are rosy at present, they will remain that way in the future.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that we should retain our traditional neutrality even in the face of new developemnts in Europe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>Discussions in strand one of the political talks are continuing.  The Government expect that, in accordance with the terms of the statement delivered by the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the House of Commons on 26 March, the transition to strand two will take place in the near future.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that, as the Government have not been a party to the strand one discussions, I am not in a position to comment on developments in that strand.</P>
      <P>The Government are also obliged, under the terms of the statement of 26 March 1991, to maintain confidentiality in relation to the process.  The recent breaching of this principle was greatly to be regretted.  The Government have adhered strictly to the requirement for confidentiality on all matters relating to the process.  We will continue to do so in the interest not least of a successful outcome to the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will understand, therefore, if <Col N="273" /> I am unable to comment on the proposals reportedly made by the SDLP.  I hope they will also accept that, even if I were free to do so, it would not be appropriate to comment on the proposals of one party in isolation from those which may have been made by other participants in strand one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Respecting the need for confidentiality in relation to the details of these talks I will steer away from any aspect of detail.  But, on the broad front, would the Minister of State accept that, in relation to our approach to these talks, our attitude should be an open, generous and fair-minded one; that we should make that very clear to all the other parties with whom hopefully we will be having discussions in the near future?  Would he accept that anything we can do of a positive nature that directly or indirectly would encourage the success of those talks should be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I would agree with the views expressed by the Deputy.  I find at this stage the feeling is that there has been an honest attempt made all round to find a solution to this very delicate overall position.  The Deputy and others in the House will be aware that, even as we speak here today, crucial talks are taking place.  Therefore, I do not wish to enter into any further discussion on this matter at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there will be no solution found without compromise; that if history has taught us anything, those who are attempting to find a solution must compromise; that those who are really courageous in that attempt are those who are prepared to compromise rather than those who dig in and remain in an ideological straitjacket?  From that point of view would he encourage all parties to be open and prepared to compromise in an effort to reach a solution and bring peace and reconciliation to this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy, that <Col N="274" /> it is in everybody's interests that these talks would succeed.  No useful purpose would be served by making comments here.  I contend that would be dangerous in view of the critical position obtaining, bearing in mind what I have already said &mdash; that I would prefer that we refrain from commenting on the position at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 14, 39 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Thai army's violent suppression last week of the peaceful protestors in Bangkok who were calling for the resignation of General Suchinda from the <Col N="275" /> office of Prime Minister was a flagrant abuse of human rights.  This brutal military response to legitimate and peaceful protest is unacceptable in any modern society and extensive television coverage of these events brought a reaction from around the world.  Ireland joined with our partners in the European Community to condemn the actions of the Thai military authorities.</P>
    <P>In a statement issued on Wednesday last we expressed our great concern at the tragic events in Thailand; we condemned the use of force by the military against unarmed civilians; we urged the Thai authorities to refrain from further violence and appealed for maximum restraint by all parties involved in the events.  We also called for a peaceful and democratic solution to the problems in Thailand as well as full respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented public appeal by the King Bhumibol of Thailand to General Suchinda and to the leader of the protestors, Mr. Chamlong, to resolve their political differences in parliament by constitutional means defused the crisis.  An amnesty was declared for all those arrested for taking part in demonstrations. Mr. Chamlong asked the people of Bangkok to remain calm and to take no further part in demonstrations.</P>
    <P>The resignation of General Suchinda from the office of Prime Minister over the weekend has eased tension in Bangkok. Parliament is due to meet this week to address the question of reform.  In this atmosphere of calm I would hope that the political crisis in Thailand can be resolved in a peaceful and democratic manner.</P>
    <P>Human rights abuses, no matter where they occur, are of particular concern to us in Ireland and to our partners in the European Community.</P>
    <P>We will continue to follow developments in Thailand closely.  In addition, we will not fail to express our deep concerns at the human rights situation there and, in consultation with our partners, consider other appropriate action, should the need arise.</P>
    <Col N="276" />
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will join me in congratulating the King on his successful intervention in defusing the immediate crisis.  Would the Minister agree that there is need for continuing monitoring of the position there until such time as the constitutional reforms have been put in place which, hopefully will encourage a fuller democratic system to prevail in that country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said in replying already, we will certainly continue to follow developments in Thailand very closely.  In conjunction with our partners in the European Community we have issued very strong statements about the position there.  We are at present hopeful that the talks in parliament there this week can find a constitutional means to resolve what was a very threatening and dangerous position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the beginning of the Yugoslav crisis, the European Community and its member states have played a leading role in the collective efforts of the international <Col N="277" /> community to find a peaceful, just and comprehensive solution to the crisis.  Ireland continues to play a full part in the elaboration of the policies of the European Community in this regard.</P>
    <P>The basic approach of the Twelve has been to seek the establishment and maintenance of an effective ceasefire in both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and to pursue, within the framework of the EC Peace Conference chaired by Lord Carrington, the goal of a comprenhensive settlement for the region.</P>
    <P>I know that all Deputies share my sense of outrage at the tragic situation which has developed in Bosnia.  This newly independent state, which was recognised by Ireland and our Community partners on 7 April 1992, is being torn apart by tragic and vicious inter-ethnic conflict.</P>
    <P>The prospects for a successful outcome of the peace process appear diminished by the continuing tragic violence, in Bosnia in particular.  I am concerned that the deteriorating situation in Bosnia may have repercussions in other Republics of the former Yugoslavia and, indeed, in the Balkans generally.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to developments in Bosnia was set out comprehensively in the statement by the Community and its member states of 11 May 1992.  We have made it clear that, while all parties to the conflict have contributed in their own way to the present state of affairs, the primary responsibility rests with the activities of the Yugoslav National Army in Bosnia and the authorities in Belgrade, from which that Army receives its directions. The killings in, and expulsion of non-Serbian populations from, large parts of Bosnia; the siege and systematic shelling of Sarajevo; and the interruption of urgently needed humanitarian relief by denial of access to Sarajevo airport have been unreservedly condemned by the Twelve members of the EC.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with our EC partners, has and continues to demand the disbanding of or the complete withdrawal of the Yugoslav National Army from Bosnia and the reopening of Sarajevo airport to allow the distribution of humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>We have also made it clear to Belgrade <Col N="278" /> and, indeed to all parties, that the integrity of all borders in the region must be respected.  We cannot allow the territory of a newly independent state to be, in effect, partitioned as a result of external military intervention.</P>
    <P>As to further steps which might be taken to bring the hostilities to a halt, and to induce Belgrade to end its aggression, I can inform Deputies that the Twelve have: (1) asked the EC Commission to present a study of possible economic sanctions against Belgrade.  This has just been received and is being examined by the Twelve; (2) adopted a policy of increasing the isolation of the representatives of Belgrade in international fora; and (3) decided to seek the suspension of the delegate of Belgrade at the CSCE from taking part in its proceedings for the present.  In addition, EC countries with resident ambassadors in Belgrade have now withdrawn them for consultations.</P>
    <P>We are consulting closely with our partners in the Twelve as to the future actions which should be taken to end outside aggression and interference in Bosnia, and to bring about a resumption of meaningful negotiations within the framework of the EC Peace Conference. Similarly, we have made it clear to the three ethnic parties in Bosnia that the faction fighting must cease so as to allow the finalisation of the internal constitutional arrangements for Bosnia already agreed in outline under the auspices of the EC which would fully respect the rights and identities of the three communities there.</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council, in its Resolution 752 of 15 May, has given full backing to the efforts of the European Community to promote negotiations on the constitutional arrangements for Bosnia.  It also demanded the withdrawal of the units of the Yugoslav National Army and the Croatian Army and has asked the Secretary-General to review the possibility of deploying a UN PeaceKeeping Mission in Bosnia.  I understand that the Security Council may shortly consider selective measures in view of continued Serbian aggression in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> In the tragic and complex situation which exists in the region, humanitarian efforts also require a sustained and concerted effort by the international community. The European Community is examining, as a matter of urgency, in conjunction with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the provision of substantial humanitarian assistance.  The Community is also looking at the possibilities for assistance to refugees and the question of safe passage for emergency supplies.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to convey my appreciation to the Irish personnel &mdash; from the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and my Department &mdash; who are serving with the European Community's Monitor Mission and with the UN in Croatia and Bosnia.  Their work is a tangible expression of Ireland's commitment to the search for a peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav crisis.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay tribute to the outstanding efforts made by Commandant Doyle of the Defence Forces, the Special Representative of the EC Peace Conference in Sarajevo, in attempting to establish an effective ceasefire in Bosnia and in promoting negotiations between the parties there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that Sarajevo, which is only three hours flight from this country, is now known as the slaughter house of Europe and that as Irish people and members of the European Community we have a huge obligation to try to help resolve the situation and, in particular, to restrain the aggressiveness of Serbia? From that point of view, would he agree that the condemnations and declarations of the European Community to date have been ineffective and what has been needed and is now even more urgently needed is a series of measures involving an economic blockade of Serbia, a naval blockade, if necessary and the cutting-off of armaments and other supplies to ensure that Serbia ends its aggression and stops the mindless murder of so many <Col N="280" /> tens of thousands of people in that country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the action we have taken to date in trying to resolve this very complex, dangerous and threatening conflict, we have played our role with our partners in the Community in endeavouring to find a solution.  I can assure the Deputies we will continue to play a meaningful and useful role in this regard. I wish to again avail of the opportunity to compliment the Irish personnel who are putting their lives in danger and who have been to the forefront in helping to find a solution to these very complex problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it is necessary that whatever can be said and done to relieve the situation in that country should be done.  I join with him in complimenting the Irish personnel working in the area.  May I ask the Minister if he agrees that the most urgent need at present is to send protected aid to the people who are effectively entrapped so as to give some form of protection? Would he further agree that there is a need to draw on such international agencies as are available to provide a buffer around the people who are immediately threatened with death? Finally would he agree that the speed with which the recognition process was pushed through the European Community was in itself a precipitating factor in the ethnic violence which has erupted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering the scale of the problem which has unfolded in the former Yugoslav country it is clear that a concerted effort by the European Community and the international community at large is required.  At the meeting of Foreign Ministers on 11 May it was decided to respond to the request by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for $150 million by providing 30 million ECU from the Community budget for emergency aid to assist refugees. The Commission is consulting with member states on the question of providing additional bilateral funding to deal <Col N="281" /> with the refugee problem there which is a further by-product of this dangerous conflict.  The Community is aware of the situation and we are fully in touch with it.  We are endeavouring to be as helpful as we possibly can in this regard.  I can assure Deputies that we are not neglecting to deal effectively with this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the complexity of the situation and I very much wish to join with the Minister in complimenting Commandant Doyle and the other Irish personnel there for the work they are doing.  Does the Minister not accept that the efforts of the European Community to date have not been successful? We are now faced with a situation where in a country on the continent of Europe, which is not that far away from Ireland, tens of thousands of people are being killed, there is a huge shortage of supplies and no milk for babies and no medicine for mothers.  The European Community seems to be helpless in bringing about any solution to this problem.  Ireland should be at the forefront of efforts to try to bring Serbia to heel to end this aggression so that that situation can be relieved.  From the point of view of fellow feeling with small reemerging republics such as Bosnia and Croatia, would the Minister not agree that we should make even a symbolic gesture of inviting a number of refugees to Ireland to show that at least our heart is in the right place and we are with them in their misery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>To date no specific request for asylum has been made to Ireland by refugees from Bosnia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often humanitarian agencies act on behalf of refugees.  Of <Col N="282" /> course, asylum policy is a matter for the Minister for Justice and perhaps the Deputy could address questions to him if this crisis develops further.  As the Deputy will be aware, many refugees are indifferent at this stage as to their place of refuge.  However, it would appear that the general wish of refugees is to return to their homes as quickly as possible and in the meantime to be temporarily located as close to their homes as possible. The aim should be to ensure their security and wellbeing with the minimum disruption and dislocation being caused to their lives.  This issue is being handled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  We are in touch with the situation and as I said to date no specific request for asylum has been made to us.  I am not certain what will happen but it is likely that most refugees would wish to be located reasonably close to their homelands so that they could return to their homes at the first available opportunity when peace is restored.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Deasy</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will consider appointing personnel from vocational walks of life to the diplomatic corps; and if he will ensure that a more business-like lobbying syndrome can be created by our ambassadors and envoys abroad.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Diplomatic posts in our missions abroad are filled by permanent civil servants who are either officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs recruited to join the foreign service or officers on temporary secondment from other Government Departments who return in due course to their home Departments. This has been the policy of successive Govenments and I do not at present envisage any departure from the existing practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs attach the highest priority to the promotion of all aspects of foreign earnings: <Col N="283" /> trade, tourism and attraction of foreign investment.  It is a major aspect of the work of all our embassies.  The precise nature of the embassy's role varies according to the circumstances in individual markets.  Where the semi-State bodies are represented, our embassies engage in general economic reporting, lobbying and problem solving at governmental level, and generally use the prestige and contacts of the embassy to reinforce the efforts of the semi-State bodies.  Where there is no semi-State representation, the embassy is directly involved in offering practical support to Irish business people seeking to develop that market.</P>
    <P>The training of our diplomatic personnel involves a considerable emphasis on foreign earnings work.  Plans are currently being developed for more intensive training in this area, including the possibility of joint training with a number of the semi-State agencies and periods of secondment for training purposes.  Other possible initiatives are also being examined. Overall, there is a strong commitment to ensuring that all our embassies play the most effective possible rôle in the promotion of foreign earnings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the expression used in relation to the civil servants referred to initially by the Minister is career diplomats, a number of whom do an excellent job.  Would the Minister not agree that nothing would be more helpful for this country than to have a team of ambassadors and envoys in foreign lands who have considerable experience of business, particularly people who have been successful in business? These are the people who make contacts at the highest level, whether by way of meeting Heads of State, Ministers or industrialists.  Can the Minister think of any other person who has greater access to the people who might be able to help us in providing new industry and additional jobs?  Why waste such an opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="284" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's suggestion that opportunities are being wasted in this area.  All embassies are heavily involved in the promotion of foreign earnings.  I have had practical experience in several Departments of the commitment and dedication of ambassadors and people in consular positions and in offices generally throughout various countries.  These people work very closely with industry, business and semi-State organisations here to endeavour to get as much foreign earnings for this country as possible.  I am aware that the Culliton report made some suggestions as to how the position might be improved. That report is being considered at present by a Government-appointed task force, and I suggest that we await the outcome of their findings to see what further changes may be made in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Andrews, make a close study of the system operated by New Zealand whereby all of their ambassadors and envoys are lobbyists first and foremost and are ambassadors and envoys in a secondary capacity? The success of these people as lobbyists has been tremendous, and that is a singular lesson for this Government and this country.  Would the Minister of State please bear in mind what I have said and convey it to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will convey the views of Deputy Deasy to the Minister and I will also take a personal look at the position.  It is necessary at this stage to have an overall strategic plan of action to deal with this whole area.  Bearing in mind that semi-State agencies and others are involved overseas we must avoid in so far as possible duplication and overlapping, the type of activity which is wasteful of both human and financial resources.  Second, it is important to ensure that the personnel are fully trained.  The task force are examining the Culliton report to see how overall performance can be improved.  I will certainly undertake to consider the matter carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 36 together.  I share the concern of the Deputy with regard to the Anti-Slavery International report on the continuing mistreatment of large numbers of people as slaves in certain parts of the world.  Slavery is a most hemous abuse of fundamental human rights and is outlawed by civilised society.  It is totally incompatible with basic human rights and freedoms and with the dignity of the human being, which is central to our policy of promotion and protection of human rights.  The Government strongly condemn such abuses, wherever and whenever they occur.</P>
      <P>The United Nations closely monitor reports of slavery through their Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery. The work of this group is examined annually in both the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights.  Ireland participates in the debates in these fora and will continue to oppose the practice of slavery in all of its contemporary forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the situation in Mauritania, I am aware of the report that thousands of Africans are being held as chattels in that country.  The Government intend to raise this situation with our <Col N="286" /> partners in the European Community, in the context of preparing the common position to be adopted by the Twelve at the United Nations General Assembly next autumn and at the next meeting of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government taken any specific action in cases such as the one mentioned and in the case of East Timor?  Are we moving motions in the United Nations to help suppressed people in these countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to put a little more backbone into the answer.  It is time that a country such as Ireland, which does not have the baggage of being a former colonial power in Africa, took a more active rôle at the United Nations as opposed to a passive rôle in abstaining on motions.  Would the Minister give a commitment on this issue, which relates to probably the most henious crime still existing on the continent of Africa now that apartheid is being undermined, that he will personally take an interest in the matter and ask our ambassador in the United Nations to initiate motions at the United Nations?</P>

      <P>Quotations from the presidency of the European Council indicate that this matter has not been neglected by the Presidency or by the Council.  We make a contribution to a voluntary fund against torture and to a voluntary fund for the human rights centre in Geneva. The centre provides advisory services to developing countries of Europe and on the protection and promotion of human rights.  We contributed something like £3,500 this year.  I am not very familiar with this area although I am aware of reports in the media and elsewhere.

      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind a point made by Deputy Owen that <Col N="288" /> virtually every one of the other members of the EC have been colonialists at some stage and that when motions like this are moved jointly, most of these countries have their tongues in their cheeks, because it is within living memory that most of them were colonialists?  With the exception of Luxembourg we are the only country who have clean hands in this regard.  There is an onus on Ireland to move motions like this and not to be content to be co-sponsors with the other 11 members of the EC.  We should take the initiative.

      <P>The basic principles governing the conduct of Ireland's international relations are outlined in the <Col N="289" /> Constitution.  Article 29 affirms Ireland's devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.  It affirms Ireland's adherence to the peaceful settlement of disputes, and it accepts international law as the basis for the conduct of relations between states.  Successive Irish Governments have considered that these principles and Ireland's interests are best served by a policy of remaining outside of military alliances.</P>
      <P>That policy has served Ireland well.  It has helped us consolidate our sovereignty and independence.  It helped spare the country from the ravages of conflict during the Second World War.  It has enabled Ireland play a constructive and positive role in international affairs &mdash; at the UN for example, in international peacekeeping, and in our relations with the Third World.  Since we joined the European Community in 1973 we have sought to promote our principles through active co-operation with our European partners in European Political Co-operation.</P>
      <P>The principles and policies we have followed in international affairs will continue to be important in the years ahead. Many of the recent developments in international politics go in a direction that Ireland has long advocated and worked for.  They provide an unprecedented opportunity to achieve our fundamental goals.  The end of the Cold War in Europe and of the system of hostile and antagonistic alliances to which it gave rise open the way for further disarmament in Europe and for new European security structures based on dialogue and co-operation.  We will be pursuing these in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which is currently meeting in Helsinki, and through the new Common Foreign and Security Policy under the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That treaty does not establish a military alliance or require Ireland to join one.  It looks to the farming of a common defence policy in new negotiations in 1996.  The Taoiseach said recently, and <Col N="290" /> again today that we never ruled out the possibility of the European Community developing eventually and in stages a stronger security defence dimension and that Ireland would enter into any future negotiations in good faith.  The outcome of these negotiations will have to be agreed unanimously and will have to take account of the changes in Europe's security landscape that I have just outlined.</P>

How and why was this statement of a major shift in Irish policy made just at the time when so many are telling us that we can welcome the contribution of other neutral countries into an enlarged European Community?  I am sure that those who suggest that we Irish must never have sacred cows would not suggest that Sweden or Austria have sacred cows. Does the Taoiseach's statement not make it necessary to have either a full debate or a position paper on neutrality.

    <P>It is the Government's intention that Ireland will become a party to this Convention at the earliest possible opportunity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Economic Area Agreement, (EEA), between the EC and EFTA was signed in Porto, Portugal on 2 May 1992.  The agreement, once it has been ratified by each of the 19 states involved, will result in the creation, on 1 January 1993, of the largest single unified market in the world, consisting of 380 million consumers and accounting for 43 per cent of the world's trade.  This will add to the economic growth already expected to be generated in the Community by the completion of the Internal Market and Ireland will be in a position to benefit from this increased economic activity.</P>
      <P>The EEA Agreement provides for free movement of goods, persons, services and capital within the 19 EC and EFTA states.  It includes common rules on competition and state aids as well as arrangement concerning procurement and intellectual property.  Institutional arrangements, including provision for an EEA Council at Ministerial level, form part of the Agreement.  Enhanced co-operation in social policy, consumer protection, the environment, research and development and education, is also provided for by the agreement.</P>
      <P>This agreement will provide a comprehensive framework for strengthening relations between the EC and its close neighbours in EFTA with whom it shares much in the political, economic, cultural and social spheres.  The agreement is a balanced one, providing benefits for all participants.</P>
      <P>Ireland enjoys excellent relations with the EFTA member states and welcomes the EEA Agreement as an appropriately strong framework for EC-EFTA co-operation. We are well placed to benefit from easier access to this larger market in goods and services, having had in 1991 a trade surplus of some IR£150 million with the EFTA countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the negotiations concern was nevertheless expressed by several member states, including Ireland, that the benefits of market integration would not be spread evenly throughout the EEA.  Together with Spain, Portugal and Greece, we therefore sought <Col N="298" /> inclusion in the Agreement of appropriate provisions to promote economic and social cohesion.  A cohesion fund to be set up by the EFTA States is among the instruments to be used in this area. The fund will consist of 500 million ECU (£400 million) in grants and 1,500 million ECU (£1,200 million) in loans which will attract a 3 per cent interest rate subsidy. These sums, which will be divided between the island of Ireland, Greece, Portugal and the most disadvantaged regions of Spain, are to be committed over a five year period beginning in 1993. Priority will be given to projects which place particular emphasis on the environment, on transport including infrastructure, education and training. Discussion has not yet taken place on the shareout of this assistance between the eligible countries.</P>

The Minister confirmed that nearly all EFTA countries are considering joining the Community &mdash; a number have applied &mdash; and he talked about a Cohesion Fund which is to run up to 1998.  What is the likely situation which will emerge when two or three of these countries at least will have become full members of the Community long before 1998?  Who will pay the money into the Cohesion Fund and what arrangements have been made to cover that eventuality?</P>

I advise the Deputy that individual applications will be dealt with in the normal way adopted by the Community; they are examined by the Commission <Col N="299" /> and we have an opportunity to express our views on those applications. The view is that the new agreement would certainly speed up accession if individual EFTA member states wish to apply for membership of the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 43 together.  The Delors II package sets out the Commission's proposals on the resources that the Community will need over the next five years, and the expenditure that will be required under the main headings.  Under the heading of structural policies and cohesion, the Commission propose that the resources going to the four less developed member states, of which Ireland is one, should be doubled overall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package has been the subject of intensive discussion at Council and at official level in recent months.  No decisions have been reached on the amounts of money proposed.  Considerable analysis has been carried out regarding the benefit of the Structural Funds, in particular to the less developed <Col N="300" /> regions &mdash; the Objective 1 regions, which include the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>At present the discussion is concentrating on the overall amounts to be attributed to the funds.  The question of the detailed administration and distribution of the Cohesion Fund as well as of the Structural Funds after 1993, must await the presentation by the Commission of the draft regulations on these.</P>
    <P>In one sense, however, the Commission proposals on the overall amounts do involve changes in the distribution. They propose an even higher concentration of the funds in the Objective 1 regions, which, as I mentioned, include the whole of Ireland.  The proposal is for an increase of the Structural Funds for these regions of 67 per cent compared with an increase of 50 per cent for other areas.  When the new Cohesion Fund for the four less developed countries is included, the Commission proposals would, as I indicated, provide for a doubling of the funds for these four countries &mdash; Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland, taken as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Delors II package reflects the greater emphasis on cohesion &mdash; on the need to reduce the disparities between the less developed areas and the rest of the Community &mdash; which was included in the Maastricht Treaty and the attached Protocol on Cohesion.  There is still considerable work to be done before agreement is reached at the Council, and tough negotiations lie ahead.  I am confident that the outcome will involve substantial increases in the amounts available to Ireland.  We argue our case for increases for Ireland of the order proposed, on the basis of our continuing lag as compared with richer regions in the Community, our very high level of unemployment, and on our productive use of the funds received to date.</P>
    <P>Since February, the proposals have been formally discussed at Community level between Ministers on seven occasions, by the Permanent Representatives on 12 occasions by other senior officials on 11 occasions.  In addition, there have been regular contacts on a continuing basis with the Commission <Col N="301" /> and with officials of other member states.</P>

      <P>First may I ask the Minister whether the Commission, or anybody in the EC, has put a figure of £6 billion on the amount which this country will receive in structural and cohesion funding?  Second, I invite the Minister to put it on the record of the House, should he wish to do so, that this country will get £6 billion if the Maastricht Treaty is ratified?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission has proposed to double the funds available.  On the basis that we got about £3 billion in the last tranche we take it that £6 billion is the figure the Commission will propose and that is the figure we will argue for. As I said, detailed discussions and debate will take place before this figure is finalised. Surely we should hold out for the Commission proposal which is to double the amount we received previously which would amount to £6 billion in round figures.</P>

      <P>If it is the case that there have been a number of meetings of permanent representatives and of Foreign Ministers, to which the Minister referred, will he agree it would have been in the national interest for the Taoiseach to have visited Lisbon during the Portuguese Presidency to see whether there is any basis for the figure of £6 billion which has been mentioned?  Would he agree that the long litany of meetings which have not given any substance to the figure of £6 billion, as we head into the British Presidency, suggest that while there may be some increase it will not be of the order claimed by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be in Lisbon on 26 and 27 June when it is hoped that this matter will be finalised but it may not be possible to do that.  The Foreign Ministers meet on 15, 16 and 21 June. There is still much negotiation and discussion to take place before the final figure is arrived at.  On the basis that the Commission propose to double the <Col N="302" /> amount we received in the last period we will fight for £6 billion.  That is our position, that is what we will be looking for and that is what we hope to get.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept it is somewhat insulting to the intelligence of the Irish electorate to, effectively, attempt to bribe them with a figure of £6 billion which is not guaranteed? We hope we secure most of it but it is not guaranteed.  It would be far more effective from the point of view of securing support for the Treaty on European Union to tell the people of the almost £2,000 million per year we are already getting as members of the Community, the existing benefits of membership and the assured benefits of membership of the European Union?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a short and essentially technical Bill with the objective of confirming the legal powers of semi-State bodies to engage in swaps and certain other financial transactions in the treasury management area.  The provisions contained in the Bill are summarised in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill for the convenience of Deputies.</P>
      <P>Placing the matter in a wider context, Deputies will be aware of the considerable growth which has taken place over the last decade or so in the financial services area both in Ireland and abroad. We have benefited from that growth already and hope to continue benefiting from it through the development of the International Financial Services Centre in particular.  The growth in the financial services industry worldwide reflects the arrival of new complex and sophisticated financial instruments.  These have been developed in response to the requirements of borrowers and others as new ways to reduce debt service costs and to minimise the risks associated with fluctuating interest and exchange rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Internationally and here in Ireland the <Col N="396" /> industry has been boosted by factors such as deregulation and the development of new technology.  The gradual removal of exchange controls here, and their complete elimination before the end of this year, has also encouraged the development of a more global market.  The growing complexity and sophistication of the whole financial services area, with its potential for achieving savings, was one of the underlying reasons for the Government's decision in 1990 to establish the National Treasury Management Agency with the specific purpose of exercising the borrowing and debt management functions of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>No less than the Exchequer itself, the commercial semi-State bodies have been affected by the opportunities presented by these developments.  At the end of 1991 their total debt stood at some £5.2 billion.  Some 46 per cent of this debt is accounted for by the ESB, Bord Telecom Éireann and Aer Lingus.  Another 39 per cent of the total debt of commercial semi-State bodies is accounted for by the three State-owned financial institutions &mdash; the ACC Bank, the Industrial Credit Corporation and the Housing Finance Agency.  This reflects the large scale of their financing of private sector operations. In summary, these six companies account for 85 per cent of the debt of the commercial semi-State bodies.  About two-thirds of the remaining 15 per cent is accounted for by Bord na Móna, CIE and NET.</P>
    <P>Fifty-seven per cent of the total debt of the commercial semi-State bodies is in Irish pounds, with 43 per cent in foreign currency.  However, over two-thirds of the foreign currency debt is in EMS currencies and, because of this and the strength of the Irish pound within the EMS, these debts carry little exchange risk.  The relatively large foreign currency exposure of the semi-State bodies reflects the fact that not all of the heavy capital investment needs of the early 1980s could be met at a competitive cost in the relatively small domestic capital market at a time when the Exchequer's own borrowing needs were also high.</P>
    <P>With this high level of debt, it is essential <Col N="397" /> that the commercial semi-State sector has available to it the full range of treasury management instruments which our domestic and international financial markets can offer.  Indeed, for the larger companies in particular, the emphasis has shifted markedly over recent years from new borrowing to active debt management. With annual debt interest costs of the commercial semi-State sector amounting to about £450 million, this approach can only be strongly encouraged. It is a fair measure of the progress of our semi-State bodies in this area that some of the larger companies are successfully offering treasury management consultancy services to other companies both at home and abroad.  In the light of all this, Deputies will appreciate just how important it is to confirm the powers of semi-State bodies to enter into the kind of transactions which are universally accepted and which underlie their treasury management operations.</P>
    <P>The best known treasury management or hedging instrument is the &ldquo;swap&rdquo;.  In its simplest form, the swap allows a borrower to convert a floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate loan or <i>vice-versa</i>.  The relative flexibility of the swap market enables borrowers to take advantage of changing market conditions so that, for example, a company wishing to fix their interest costs could borrow on a standard floating rate basis at any time and then use the swap market to fix the interest rate when fixed rates have fallen to a level acceptable to the company.  Use of the swap market can also give borrowers access to funds at rates below those otherwise available.  Outside of the State-owned banks, who deal in these transactions in the normal course of their banking business and who are therefore provided for separately in this Bill, the commercial semi-State bodies have entered into £1.3 billion of swaps in various ways.  About three-quarters of this amount is accounted for by the ESB and Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>Hedging transactions such as swaps are undertaken principally in order to minimise certain risks.  They can also reduce the cost of borrowing and provide a <Col N="398" /> means of insuring against certain losses. These transactions make a positive contribution to the management of commercial semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the doubts which exist about the legal powers of companies to engage in certain treasury transactions; doubts, which, I would emphasise, have arisen in respect of both private and public sectors.  In January 1991 in the UK the House of Lords found that, in the absence of express statutory authority, the council of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham did not have the legal power to enter into swap transactions.  While the legal position of UK local authorities is not directly analagous to that of Irish semi-State bodies, it has prompted banks and their legal advisers to take a very close look at the legal powers of Irish companies.</P>
    <P>As those legal powers were generally set down before the emergence of swaps and other similar financial instruments, it is not surprising that express authority covering them is rarely found in the memoranda of association or the governing legislation.  While specific statutory provisions exist in the case of the National Treasury Management Agency and the building societies, it had previously been generally assumed that, in the case of companies and semi-State bodies, the necessary powers could be implied as incidental to the pursuit of the activities that were expressly authorised, especially where the transaction was part of a bona fide hedging strategy, as is the case with the treasury transactions concluded by the semi-State bodies.  In this regard it is worth noting that, in arriving at their decision, the House of Lords overturned an earlier UK Court of Appeal decision that swaps entered into for debt management purposes were valid.</P>
    <P>In any event, consideration of the UK House of Lord's decision led banks in this country to the view that the legal powers of Irish companies, both private sector and public sector, needed to be updated by providing specific authority to undertake swaps and other hedging transactions.  This view was endorsed by <Col N="399" /> the Attorney General in so far as the commercial semi-State bodies are concerned. In the case of companies in the private sector the necessary changes can be made by the relatively straightforward procedure of amending a company's memorandum of association.  However, for the majority of commercial semi-State bodies &mdash; those whose borrowing powers are set out in legislation &mdash; a statutory provision is needed.  The Bill now before the House makes that provision.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the specific provisions in the Bill I must mention that discussions have been held with the main commercial semi-State bodies to ensure that this legislation would meet their requirements and achieve its purpose of removing all legal doubts in his area. The Irish Bankers' Federation were also consulted and are satisfied that these provisions met their concerns.</P>
    <P>As Deputies can see, the Bill is a short one.  Its provisions are broadly based on section 34 of the Building Societies Act, 1989, which allows those bodies to engage in hedging transactions under the supervision of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is, of course, a standard provision relating the necessary definitions to be included in the legislation.  Section 2 contains the main provisions of the Bill. This section confirms the legal power of bodies whose borrowings are subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance to engage in financial transactions for the purpose of reducing or eliminating the risk of loss arising from fluctuating interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices or similar factors affecting their business or the business of another company in the same group; reducing borrowing costs or the costs of other transactions carried out in the course of their business and increasing the return on an investment.</P>
    <P>This provision confines these bodies to transactions of an essentially hedging nature.  Broadly the Bill covers commercial semi-State bodies and their subsidiaries but does not apply to local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> The section also provides that, after this Bill is enacted, the powers confirmed by it can be exercised only in compliance with specifications issued by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the relevant Minister.  The requirement for ministerial specification as to the type or types of contract that may be entered into is designed to ensure that only instruments which have a primarily hedging function will be allowed.  The requirement for prior ministerial consent is designed to preclude bodies for whom such transactions would not be appropriate. The Minister for Finance is also given discretion to lay down such other conditions as he considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 2 further provides that, in the case of transactions covered by this Bill, third parties dealing with semi-State bodies in good faith are given protection by this section.  This provision is analogous to section 12 of the Building Societies Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>As institutions providing a banking service the ACC Bank plc and the Industrial Credit Corporation plc are provided for in section 2 separately from other semi-State bodies.  Their power to enter into the transactions covered by the Bill for the purposes of their banking business is confirmed.  Specifications are not required in the case of these bodies because they are providing a banking service under the supervision of the Minister for Finance.  Sections 3 and 4 are standard sections.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to emphasise that specifications issued under section 2 (2) will emphasise the prohibition of speculation and require treasury transactions to be operated under board control and supervision.  This is important because in the Hammersmith and Fulham case, which I mentioned earlier, the heavy losses arose because they engaged in swaps for purely speculative purposes and unrelated to their debt. Where appropriate, the consent of the Minister for Finance will be required for particular transactions as is already the case with swap transactions.  I would stress that the instructions covered by this Bill are not borrowing instruments, <Col N="401" /> though they may be indirectly linked to borrowing instruments.  Any borrowing by semi-State bodies requires ministerial consent under existing legislation or, in the case of a small number of companies, under their memoranda and articles of association.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this purely technical Bill the provisions of which deal with the interests and concerns of banks. This is an understandable interest when one considers what the Ministers said in relation to commercial semi-State bodies which, at the end of 1991, had total borrowings of £5.2 billion, 57 per cent of which was in Irish currency and 43 per cent in foreign currency.  Therefore, in relation to the scale of borrowings it is understandable that the banks would require some type of protection of their interests.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill emerged really out of the United Kingdom Hazell <i>versus</i> Hammersmith and Fulham case and the swaps engaged in by that local authority when their legislative provisions were found wanting.  It was understandable that our banks would express similar concerns.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the provisions of this Bill will not relate to local authorities here.  When replying he might clarify the position in relation to local authorities because they are involved in borrowings and, I predict, will become even more involved in borrowings in the future. Many legislative provisions and regulations are emanating from the EC and this House, which will place extra financial strains on local authorities.  I might cite, for example, the Abbatoirs Act, the Building Regulations Act, the Health and Safety Act, all of which place additional strains on the purse strings of local authorities involved in borrowing. Perhaps the Minister would say whether local authorities should enter into debt in order to expand their activities.</P>

    <P>The provisions of the Bill are clear-cut, particularly in regard to debt management. It is understandable that commercial semi-State bodies would have to <Col N="402" /> resort to these types of swaps as an effective debt management exercise.  My party will be supporting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister correctly described this Bill as a comparatively technical one.  Its introduction enables us to examine the growth of the swaps market in an Irish context, in particular the dependence on them of the three companies to which he referred and their usage in order to reduce the cost of servicing their substantial debts.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the debate in this House concerning the future of the Agricultural Credit Corporation on 1 April last, bearing in mind that the provisions of section 3 refer specifically to the ACC &mdash; and by extension to the Industrial Credit Corporation &mdash; perhaps the Minister would indicate what type of strategic thinking has evolved in his Department in relation to this matter.  Once again this House is being presented with an <i>ad hoc</i> Bill in response to a court case which arose outside the jurisdiction of this State in regard to activities that could never occur here because of the draconian mailed hand of the Department of the Environment around the throat of every county secretary or manager.  The speculative manner in which certain Labour controlled local authorities in Britain endeavoured to get around the Thatcherite freeze on cash in the eighties is of some anecdotal interest but certainly of no political interest to us.  Most important of all, I contend those types of <i>ad hoc</i> legal decisions should not drive fiscal and financial policy as they pertain to the future of banking here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has placed on record the scale of the exposure of debt in the case of commercial semi-State companies.  It would be interesting if we could ascertain the scale of debt of all local authorities. It would also be interesting to have from the Minister an indication of the level of current account deposit at the disposal of those local authorities on a daily basis; what kind of manipulation of that current account is open to them to maximise their return so that they can reap the greatest return from our fairly sophisticated financial <Col N="403" /> marketplace.  Clearly that power is not being given to local authorities.  Nor is discretion being afforded local authorities to have that power exercised on their behalf by financial agencies other than banks with which they might wish to enter into contractual arrangements. For example, it would be interesting to know whether local authorities could seek the assistance of the National Treasury Management Agency in these matters or whether such assistance would be of advantage to them.  These are questions to which the Minister might respond when applying or in the course of our Committee Stage discussions.</P>
    <P>In the context of providing further legal certainty in an increasingly complex financial marketplace here, perhaps the Minister could inform us how he envisages that market developing after 1992, just six months away if one omits the summer and Christmas holiday periods. On a number of occasions he has referred to the position post-1993.  The most recent of which was at a function held last night to celebrate the successful development of an Irish based bank with a French partner.  What is the strategic thinking in the Department of Finance in relation to how the Irish banking system and the related financial market will be in the next few years?  Concerning the provision in the Finance Act in regard to the special savings accounts introduced to minimise revenue loss as a result of DIRT, as a result of money being taken from the jurisdiction and deposited elsewhere, what countervailing measures does the Minister propose to take to reassure the Irish equities market and the life assurance market which is essential for employment, not only directly but also indirectly, if one takes into account the role those operations play on the Dublin property market and the role they play as a source of revenue to, for example, the local authority of which I am a member?  If one ravages the heart of the financial sector of Dublin, which I think the Finance Act in part has the potential to do, one does not square little boxes in the Department of Finance and <Col N="404" /> keep money counters relatively happy in relation to the tax revenues which are needed to balance the books at national level; rather one interferes in a very dramatic and dynamic way in a very complex set of relationships, the scale of which the Department of Finance did not fully take on board when they looked at this measure, at the Finance Act or the ACC Bill of 1 April.  No pun is intended in relation to that date.</P>
    <P>The next question I want to pose to the Minister by way of a chapter heading is: to what extent can we expect further legislation from him in respect of financial transactions or the role of the financial sector in our society post-1992? What threats does he now see for those sectors which, of their own admission, are going to be considerably disadvantaged as a result of the establishment of the special savings accounts and other measures designed to protect the banking deposit base with the abolition of exchange controls and all subsequent controls on 1 January 1993?  Is anybody in the Department of Finance raising these questions and coming forward with proposals to deal with them?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech stated that the measures in this Bill were put together following consultation with the main commercial semi-State bodies.  Did additional consultation take place with other people involved in these types of transactions?  Were their views sought also?  I see that the Irish Bankers' Federation were also consulted.  I should like the Minister, if he is in a position to so do, to indicate the range of consultations which took place and to say whether the various other finance houses who engage in this type of activity had an input to the Bill either directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>The reason I ask the question is that between 1979 when we joined the EMS and January 1993 when we enter the Single Market economic conditions, which will lead inevitably to a single currency by the end of the decade at the latest, there will have grown up in Ireland, primarily in Dublin but not exclusively, a very extensive and sophisticated, highly motivated and economically <Col N="405" /> well paid small financial sector which not only has developed an expertise which has been recognised by many international banking groups but which has led in part to the establishment of the international financial services centre in the Custom House Docks area.  We now have a proven expertise in the area of money management which up until 1979 we did not require because of our integration with the British sterling currency. A home grown industry by and large has grown up and developed during that 12 year period.  Many of the people in that industry are of the view that without the establishment of clear strategic thinking which only the Government can bring into play there will be substantial losses of employment in that sector at the coalface and substantial consequent losses down along the line.  I referred to these earlier, for example, the impact on the Dublin property market which in turn has an enormous impact on construction to say nothing of its impact on the tax base revenue of the local authority of which I am a member.  The Minister might respond to that point in his reply.</P>
    <P>In light of the Culliton report and the need to move from capital grants for industry to equity participation, has the Minister given any consideration to the development, in conjunction with the Irish money markets, of some system of unit trust funding which would.  enable institutional investors, small or managed funds, individuals or any combination, to be able to provide the equity capital for incoming multinational corporations which will be attracted to locate in Ireland for reasons of the quality of the labour force or the taxation regime open to them?  Based on what the Minister has said on numerous occasions and having regard to the massive capital scarcity for local authorities and the way in which the equity market has been disadvantaged by the special savings accounts provided for in the Finance Act, some creative counter-vailing measures should be contemplated by the Department of Finance if they are doing their job or if they know their job.  I do not want to sound too philosophic about this but it brings us <Col N="406" /> back to the main point about whether the Department of Finance have reverted to being the treasury, with all that implies, or if there is a vestige left of the department of economic development, a role it took on in real terms under the former Deparment Secretary, Mr. Ken Whitaker, a former member of the Upper House and a very thoughtful contributor to debates in that House?  Have the Department lost that kind of economic development role they sought for themselves from within their intellectual resources on the one hand and with the active encouragement of successive Ministers for Finance and, in particular, the former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, on the other?</P>
    <P>I believe those are reasonable questions to pose on a Second Stage debate in the context of responding to a financial Bill which tragically, may very well be necessary but which has been brought in as a reaction to a negative decision in another jurisdiction, a decision which has cast some doubt over.  the legitimacy of some transactions which have taken place in the Irish money market.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister in a position to outline the role he sees for the National Treasury Management Agency in the context of providing direct services for either Telecom, the ESB, the Housing Finance Agency or other semi-State Bodies which have large borrowings?  Is the Minister of the view that the ESB, directly or indirectly, are more capable of taking on this activity now legitimised, rather than giving it to an agency we spent a lot of money establishing and which have performed very well by everyone's standards? The targets set for that agency last year were met in excess and I understand they are on course to meet the targets set for them this year.  There is a general optimism and high morale within the National Treasury Management Agency.  Will the Minister indicate if he has given any indication, through the relevant Ministers in the Cabinet, that the activities of these bodies should be handled on a day-to-day basis by the National Treasury Management Agency?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to <Col N="407" /> have regard to the extraordinary vulnerability in terms of this sector, the most protected sector of our economy, which is not very well run.  The dispute between the IBOA and management should give cause for much alarm about the future of the traditional banks who have about 80 per cent of the market.  I am not suggesting that the Minister should rationalise these banks &mdash; I am not sure they would be great value &mdash; but an interventionist Minister, one who would see, as does the present Minister, that the State has a pro-active rôle in this area, one that is unique to the status and powers of the State, should intervene to wake those banks up to the reality of what they are facing in the context of continental Europe and to stop their games in the north-east corner of North America.  Alternatively, he could consider how the rest of the banking sector in Ireland under the direct control of the Minister and his colleagues &mdash; ACC, ICC, the post office network dealing with deposit savings, the post office bank and the Trustee Savings Bank &mdash; can be brought into gear as a vibrant third major player in the Irish banking system.</P>
    <P>I have posed those questions before and I am doing so now because my fear is that in the absence of any creative, imaginative, strategic thinking in the Department of Finance, if these people are in the treasury bunker and not on the floor of economic development they will miss this opportunity and, by default, the components under the control of the Minister for Finance will be disposed of at discount prices to no good advantage. The whole financial sector, with all the consequential dependencies related to it, would be exposed post-1992 to very severe competition, for which it is not well equipped to respond at present, and we would lose out significantly.  I ask the Minister to respond to those points when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Bill, and the Minister's speech, have been introduced in terms of the advantages that will accrue to semi-State companies as a <Col N="408" /> result of having the latest debt management instruments available to them. The purpose of the Bill as I read it is to protect the banks; it is as simple as that. The banks, obviously, feel that after the Hammersmith decision they may be at risk for that element of the debt that is managed in foreign currency.  I cannot say whether that is the case or whether the effect of the decision in the Hammersmith case can be imported directly into the position here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn made some remarks about the origins of the Hammersmith case.  Both he and Deputy Finucane referred to the lack of clarity about the position here as it affects local authorities. As I understand it &mdash; I would ask the Minister to address this point &mdash; I do not think this issue arises in the case of local authorities because I do not think they have this kind of debt or are in any way concerned with this type of debt management.  Even on the capital side, most local authorities are probably covered by mortgages and direct Exchequer aid.  Therefore, it does not arise as far as local authorities are concerned, although it is an entirely different matter as to whether it should arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at the extent of indebtedness of the very small number of State or semi-State companies that exist &mdash; £5.2 billion, almost half of which is in foreign currency, is a large debt for a small number of companies.  I am interested in the Minister's reference to the fact that the emphasis has shifted markedly in recent years in these companies from new borrowing to active debt management. He provides figures on that and goes on to say that some of the staff in these semi-State companies provide, on a consultancy basis, treasury management expertise.  I find that interesting in the context of the discussion we had in the House at the time of the setting up of the National Treasury Management Agency. The only argument for that agency at the end of the day, no matter how it was dressed up, was that the public service was not paying the going rate for the exceptionally skilled, specialised, and important nature of the work being done <Col N="409" /> by full time civil servants in the Department of Finance in managing the national debt.  Other arguments were adduced in the Bill, but that was the main argument.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the people in the Department of Finance have a considerable international reputation in this area.  It is acknowledged that, with a rather difficult portfolio, they did a very good job for the State.  However, the fact is that they were being poached by the private sector and, while under the aegis of the Department, they could not command the salaries they would get in the marketplace.  In the first year of the National Treasury Management Agency that has been borne out.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that there seems to be, within the semi-State companies, people with similar expertise who are capable of lending this expertise in the form of consultancy services.  I presume this does not mean that these people are breaching the pay guidelines within the State companies, which I presume, are roughly commensurate with those in the Department of Finance.  Therefore, if the argument obtained for the Department of Finance officials to be released from the chattels of public service pay constraint, presumably the same argument applies for the people working in State companies who provide this service.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that point.</P>
    <P>I would also like to hear his views on whether the expertise and skills in the National Treasury Management Agency could be put at the disposal of State companies. Is it true that until some years ago borrowing was carried out for some of these State companies by the Exchequer?  The level of indebtedness we are now talking about is a relatively recent phenomenon &mdash; I did not have time to research this matter but that is my memory of it.  Is there any reason, since we have set up this specialist agency, that the skills in that agency could not be made available to leading State companies such as Bord Telecom and the ESB in terms of managing their portfolio?</P>
    <P>I am not arguing against the necessity <Col N="410" /> for our leading State companies to have available to them whatever treasury instruments are available in the marketplace. I accept that some of these financial instruments have grown up since the legislation was put in place to found these bodies.  If the Hammersmith case is to be our guideline, many private sector companies will also be out of date.  It seems important that if debt management is an important element in financing the debt load of these companies, then the best and most efficient instruments ought to be available to the management of these companies.  I have no complaint with that.</P>
    <P>On the question of private sector companies, is it true that the banks are exposed in terms of their dealings with State comanies following on the English case?  If it is true, presumably the same applies to private companies who would probably be involved on a more regular basis in terms of swaps and the use of other hedging transactions.  Is there some kind of general instruction of exhortation going out to private companies that they should amend their memorandum and articles of association to comply with this?  The main thrust of the Bill is to give the banks this protection.  Presumably the Minister is arguing that if we do not give the banks this protection, this element of relief that is available to the State companies in managing their debt will not be available to them, so I presume that we have very little choice but to nod this through.  Presumably the same questions arise in respect of the private sector.</P>
    <P>As has been said, the Bill seems to be a technical measure.  The continued growth of our State companies is obviously a very important dimension of our economic performance.  Over the seventies and eighties it became clear that some of the State companies have been positively strangled by the extent of their indebtedness and we never managed to get the debt/equity ratio right.  No Government ever seemed to want to address that problem with the result that it has got out of hand in some of the State <Col N="411" /> companies in the recent past, so that they ended up being privatised or sold off or being prepared for privatisation, or struggling with a debt, like Bord na Móna, for example, that is almost beyond dealing with, and which has led to the kind of cutbacks and rationalisation that would otherwise not have been contempleted.</P>
    <P>I accept that the continued growth of our public enterprises is a very important aspect of our industrial strategy.  In that sense, if access to swaps and other hedging transactions is considered important in efficiently managing an element of that debt, then it is proper to facilitate that in every way we can, but I would like to hear the Minister on the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Finucane, Quinn and Rabbitte for their contributions to the debate.  Many of the points of detail mentioned by the Deputies will be dealt with on Committee Stage.  While this Bill is largely technical, it is important for those concerned.  The bodies involved have pressed hard over recent weeks to see this Bill through the House.  I thank Opposition Deputies for facilitiating the Bill.  These bodies would have preferred to have this through before the Finance Bill but that was not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transactions involved here are now part of the everyday treasury management operations of major companies everywhere.  It is therefore essential that the legal doubts which followed from the Hammersmith and Fulham decision in the UK should be resolved in a definitive manner and that semi-state bodies should not find themselves operating at a disadvantage relative to other companies when it comes to availing of the opportunities offered by the financial services sector.  With a total indebtedness of the order of £5 billion, the need to minimse debt service costs in the semi-state sector hardly needs to be emphasised.  This Bill will facilitate such an approach while ensuring that semi-state bodies do not become involved in operations which do <Col N="412" /> not arise from their own debt management or other business activities.</P>
    <P>Many of the developments in financial instruments which occurred in the 1980s were designed to facilitate better mangement of liabilities and assets.  While the European Monetary System helped greatly to reduce the volatility of exchange and interest rates, significant differences remain between the individual financial markets and member states.  In addition, the EMS currencies are still exposed to exchange rate fluctuations with the major economies in the rest of the world such as the United States and Japan.  Consequently it is likely that the trend established during the last decade will continue, with new hedging instruments being developed on a regular basis to meet the ever changing needs of the market place.</P>
    <P>The objectives and policies for hedging must be clearly established at the outset. This legislation limits the hedging operations of the non-bank commercial semi-State bodies to the management of their own debt or assets or to hedging risks arising from their business.  The objectives of hedging is not to make a profit but to reduce the cost of borrowing and the risks arising from volatile interest and exchange rates and commodity prices. The requirements that a State body must secure a specification issued by the Minister for Finance before they can avail of the powers confirmed by this Bill will further guard against transactions which are not of a strictly hedging nature and will be used to ensure that the powers confirmed by this Act are subject to board level supervision.  Hedging instruments are designed specifically to reduce or eliminate exposure to price movements and interest and exchange rate changes and will achieve this when used properly.</P>
    <P>The swap developed during the 1980s as a tool to enable companies to vary the terms of their loans and therefore to manage their liabilities more effectively. More recently, swaps have been used in a similar way to manage assets.  Swaps originally developed where each party to the swap could access a particular market <Col N="413" /> on comparatively better terms than the other party.  This comparative advantage would then be shared between the parties, and any intermediaries arranging the transaction, to lower their funding costs. The parties entered the markets where they had the advantage and agreed to exchange or swap cash flows.  This result gave the parties better terms in their preferred market than if they had entered it directly.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware the financial services industry about which Deputy Quinn spoke, is one where Ireland has made considerable advances in recent years.  The concept of an international financial services centre was first proposed in 1986 to take advantage of the worldwide growth in financial services. The Custom House Docks was chosen as the location for the centre and its success is now very evident.  The 200 or so companies approved by the Minister for Finance to operate in the centre have committed to the creation of close to 2,900 new jobs over the next 3 to 4 years. In excess of one third of these new jobs have already been created.  Additional extra employment has arisen in associated activities outside the centre in the accounting, legal and general services area.  Moreover, the IFSC provides a significant and growing source of corporation tax for the Exchequer, IR£47 million in 1991.  These companies are primarily involved in: insurance; funds management; treasury management and banking.  The centre has attracted leading international companies in each of the above fields from North America, Japan and Europe.</P>
    <P>There is a strong emphasis on a high standard of financial regulation and supervision in the centre and this ranges from the initial certification of projects by the Minister to ongoing supervision by the Central Bank.  The ongoing legislative programme is designed to enhance the type of product available to companies within the centre.  Last year's Finance Act, for example, contained provisions which made certain life assurance and other investment products more easily available within the centre.  We <Col N="414" /> have been among the leaders in implementing recent EC directives concerning collective investment undertakings. Against this background it is important that there is no doubt about the legal powers of semi-State bodies operating in the financial markets and this Bill is designed to remove such doubts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane asked why the local authorities and health boards were excluded.  There are two reasons.  The Minister for Finance does not have the statutory function of consenting to the borrowings of these bodies and, secondly, the legislation is primarily designed to facilitate the commercial and management operations of commercial semi-State bodies whose resources, both in terms of personnel and expertise, allow them to engage in the type of transactions covered by the Bill.  The local authorities and health boards are not engaged in the type of commercial operations which would make this Bill appropriate to them.  It is not intended to allow any of the bodies covered by the legislation to engage in transactions which are inappropriate to the nature of their operations. It is a matter for administrative decision in a case by case basis.  The expertise of the body in question and current market opportunities would be relevant factors in reaching such decisions if they were put before us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised the matter of the impact of the Finance Bill on the financial markets, particularly in relation to DIRT.  My view is that the changes in DIRT protect the exchange rate which our financial services have for years been talking about.  This will ensure that we retain savings in this country to meet the requirements of industry and credit.  I quite understand the concerns of some sectors of the industry at what might happen now but it is the old story &mdash; you have to get the horse before the cart.  If we were to take the risk that the money might be taken out, there would be no possibility of correcting the decision afterwards.  We have stopped what would have been a flood of activity by the banks in advising people how to move their <Col N="415" /> money outside the country.  That would immediately affect the markets and the exchange rate and push up the interest rate.  That happened in Germany.  If it happened there, what would happen here?  We have resolved that matter and it is satisfactory to see the banks advising people to keep their money here.</P>
    <P>Another question to be asked is what other difficulties that might create for equity and for the insurance industry.  We had already set up a strategic team to look at these matters before I made the announcement regarding DIRT.  I am watching what the insurance industry are saying.  That industry have had substantial comparative advantages for a number of years.  In the order of balance, they had a very good position for a long time.  We heard very little about it.  I do not say that in any argumentative fashion.</P>
    <P>We must take into account what is happening in the marketplace because of the Single Market and the final move towards removing exchange controls by the end of the year.  Our companies are trying to sell in the continental markets, mainly in Germany.  One of the world's biggest banks outside Japan was represented at a very prestigious gathering of bankers yesterday evening.  Our President is doing an excellent job for the country in Paris.  Also in Paris our financial services are making one of the first presentations of how we can sell our gilts in the huge French market which we have not broached so far.  Even a small inroad would have a considerable effect.  It is a fact that profits made on pension funds and commercial profits move out of the country, while our companies sell our paper and our gilts outside and that money comes back to the country.  The liquidity in the market must favour our side.  I belong to the school of thought who believe that the basics must be right for us.  In recent years the relaxation of exchange controls has enabled many people to move outside but that will settle down in a few years.  People in the industry believe it will settle down within two <Col N="416" /> years.  We will have to treat the question with caution.</P>
    <P>Everything cannot move to the 10 per cent rate.  We need a system where people who have ideas can be matched with people who have money for investment. I am not convinced we have such a system and I look forward to its development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an area which must be watched on an ongoing basis.  Deputy Quinn also asked about State bodies on whose behalf the NTMA could borrow. The National Treasury Management Agency have no statutory power to undertake transactions on their own accord.  The agency is an agent of the State and undertakes transactions on behalf of the State.  Even if it were possible for the agency to act as an agent or intermediary on behalf of State bodies, those bodies would still require legal power to engage in the transactions and to benefit from them.  It would not be realistic for the NTMA to operate effectively on behalf of a wide range of bodies who already have highly sophisticated treasury operations tailored to their own needs.  Some of the large semi-State bodies are successfully offering treasury management consultancy services to other bodies at home and abroad. <Col N="417" /> Deputy Rabbitte asked why there was difficulty with the Agency's staffing if this is so.  The position of the Agency is slightly different.  We are trying to handle £25 billion and for the first time we are trying to create a two-way process in our market where you can buy and sell in the traditional way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about the position of private sector companies.  This is a matter between the companies concerned and their own banks.  It is a relatively simple matter for any of these companies to change their own memorandum and articles of association if they so wish.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn raised the question of the role of the National Treasury Management Agency and the borrowing of local authorities.  The agency has been given power by the Government to borrow money on behalf of the Exchequer and to manage the national debt.  They have no specific function in relation to the borrowing of local authorities. The debt of £70 million incurred by local authorities last year is relatively small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that for all local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The scale of the borrowing operations is not appropriate to this Bill.  Deputy Rabbitte asked whether the Bill was being introduced in order to give comfort to Irish banks.  The Hammersmith decision arose because the UK local authorities took the view that they had no legal authority to engage in swaps and, consequently, no legal obligation to fulfil the swap contracts entered into.  In Ireland no swap counterparties have taken such a view.  It should be emphasised that no Irish local authority are engaged in swaps.  The public sector bodies in his country who did engage in swaps were commercial semi-State bodies and took the view that the powers were sufficiently wide to cover swap contracts. The present legislation is designed to confirm the legal powers of the commercial semi-State bodies in this area and to protect them from the doubts which <Col N="418" /> the Hammersmith decision has raised about swaps powers generally.  I am not sure whether we are going on to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the essential meat of the Bill.  Subsection (4) reads: &ldquo;Where a person to whom subsection (1) of this section applies effects a contract with another person...&rdquo;  Is this the core of the legal case in the U.K.?  Will the Minister take us through the implications of this?  The provision seems to be pointing specifically to a vulnerability arising from the judgment in the U.K.  Will the Minister clarify the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (4) applies to the contracts entered into by semi-State bodies other than the ACC and ICC.  It provides that third parties dealing with such bodies in good faith may enforce such contracts notwithstanding that the semi-State body in question acted outside the powers given in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The third party protection is analogous to that given to third parties dealing with building societies as set out in the Building Societies Act, 1989.  The protection for third parties given by section 2 (4) is not relevant to either ACC or ICC as it gives protection against non compliance with provisions which do not apply to those two bodies, namely, the restriction on the range of purposes as provided for in section 2 (1) and the needs to comply with specifications issued by the Minister under section 2 (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the only area of difficulty. Section 2 (1) (a) confirms the legal power of semi-State bodies to engage in financial transactions for the purpose of, first, reducing or eliminating the risk of loss arising from fluctuating interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices or similar factors affecting their business or the business of another company in the group; second, reducing borrowing costs or the cost of other transactions carried out in the course of that business or, third, increasing the return on the investment.  The provision confines bodies to transactions of an essentially hedging nature and broadly covers the semi-State bodies and their subsidiaries. <Col N="421" /> As I said, these are effectively linked with the Building Societies Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this is a complex matter but am I correct in saying that the Minister is giving himself some powers in the course of legitimising trade in swaps?  Subsection (2) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>The exercise by a person after the passing of this Act of a power to effect contracts referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall be subject to and in compliance with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  requirements specified by the Minister as to the type or types of contract that may be effected under that subsection,</P>
      <P>(ii)  any conditions specified by the Minister in relation to the particular person aforesaid, and communicated to the person by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Are the Department of Finance now going to ride shotgun in relation to the bodies mentioned by the Minister in his Second Stage speech, set out constraints in relation to the nature of the swaps they may engage in and limit certain kinds of activities?  What requirements do the Minister and the Department have in mind in relation to subparagraphs (i) and (ii)?  I understand that a third party dealing directly with the person cannot be held responsible for someone who is engaged in certain transactions without the specific consent or authority which may be conferred under subsection (2) (a).  Would the Minister outline the thinking of the Department of Finance as an element of departmental control is being sought that I do not fully appreciate or understand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about agencies which have been well tried and tested.  The Department are familiar with the activities that they have been engaged in over the years.  The purpose of this provision is to put the matter beyond legal doubt.  If further State bodies wish to engage in this activity the Department would be concerned that the regulations are complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> Apart from swaps, it is not intended that ministerial consent will be required for day to day treasury transactions; that will continue to be a matter for the treasury management sections of semi-State bodies.  They form part of the normal commercial activities of these bodies and it would not be practical or desirable for the Minister to become involved or have responsibility for individual transactions. As required by the Bill, the Minister, in consultation with each body or the relevant parent Minister, will specify the types of transactions which may be undertaken.  He will also lay down general guidelines for the operation of these treasury transactions.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Quinn, the guidelines are (i) the transactions may be undertaken only for the purposes related to a company's commercial borrowing or debt management activities and not for any speculative purpose as required by the legislation, and (ii) it will be the responsibility of the board of directors of the company to supervise and control the treasury operations of the company and lay down the parameters within which those operations are to be carried out by the management of the company.</P>
    <P>In relation to swaps, the Minister's consent will continue to be required as these have the effect of fundamentally altering the basic financial terms on which the Minister had consented to borrowings. It is a totally different thing to approve a loan as against a swap which may give rise to fluctuations in relation to the currency involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) authorises persons, semi-State bodies or subsidiaries, to engage in swaps while subsection (2) states that the exercise of that power to effect contracts referred to in subsection (1) shall be subject to and in compliance with requirements specified by the Minister as to the type or types of contract that may be effected under that subsection.  I am not an expert in this area and I am relying on my own briefing information but I understand, for example, that there is a range of contracts or swaps that one may engage in &mdash; asset <Col N="423" /> swaps, forward swaps, amortising swaps, zero coupon swaps, callable swaps, swap options, voluntary swap, swap sales and reverse swaps.  Is it conceivable that the Department of Finance may decide, in respect of Telecom Éireann for example, as distinct from the ESB and Aer Lingus, for some reason or another that the Minister should give a direction to the treasury management section not to engage in asset swaps or prevent them from engaging in amortising swaps?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What will happen in practice is that the Minister will issue approval in respect of a certain category. The treasury management section of the agency concerned would then have flexibility in relation to that category and the Department would not try to tie them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how I understand it; we were obviously talking about categories. Given the speed with which they happen, one could not be concerned about individual transactions.  Therefore a cautious Department of Finance, having received good advice from the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency, may well say that certain kinds of swaps have deficiencies or weaknesses.  Is it envisaged, in order to protect the lending base of the company in question, so as not to put their repayments at risk, that the treasury management section would be prevented from engaging in certain kinds of swaps if the Minister considered that there was an unacceptable risk?  Is that the intent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the power that the Minister is seeking from the House.  In relation to the category of contracts and swaps which I have read into the record, before the treasury management section of the semi-State body can exercise this power they will have to seek clearance from the Minister through the Department that, for example, asset <Col N="424" /> swaps, forward swaps, callable swaps and swap options are acceptable in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about swaps as a category for which the Minister's consent will be required.  The Department of Finance do not wish to interfere with most of the commercial activities that the treasury management section of the semi-State body are engaged in but swaps are different.  In respect of those categories the treasury management section would proceed with their activities but in relation to swaps, there could be fluctuations in the currency concerned as regards a fixed loan. Therefore, the approval of the Ministers concerned will be required for a category of swaps but not for the detail.  It is intended that this will be given in respect of an annual programme involving an overall maximum nominal value.</P>
      <P>The Minister's consent will be given based on four conditions &mdash; (a) swap agreements to be confined to licensed banks with a minimum level of assets, named insurance companies or, in the case of non-resident banks, those with at least an AA credit rating; (b) documentation to be in the standard form used in the swap market; (c) where debt has been swapped into fixed rates it is the responsibility of the relevant boards to set the maximum rates involved except in the case of Irish pound rates where the Minister for Finance may lay down a maximum rate and (d) details of swaps to be reported to the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, the Minister is saying that what is being put into legislation here is a regularisation of current practice, including the reportage mechanism, annually or frequently, about the categories of activities in relation to swaps in which they get engaged and, presumably, the level of exposure at any time over a 12 month period.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 20:</P>
    <P>In page 8, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash; Where the birth of a child is registered in a register maintained under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1987, and the name of a person is entered as father of the child on the register so maintained, then the information contained in the register shall be admissible in any criminal proceedings as evidence that the person whose name is so entered is the father of the child and such person shall be presumed to be the father of the child unless the contrary is satisfactorily proved.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Shatter).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this amendment previously and, to date, we have not been satisfied with the response of the Minister of State in relation to the difficulties which arose as a result of the Waterford case.  Deputy McCartan's amendment led to quite a lot of debate <Col N="427" /> and indeed there was much soul searching.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept this amendment although he said that, for various reasons, he would not do so.  If he accepted it he said that it would put the onus on the accused person to prove his innocence rather than <i>vice versa.</i> However, where child sexual abuse and incest, particularly distasteful crimes are involved, which are exceedingly difficult to bring to court and to prosecute, we should try to ensure that when a case is brought to court it is prosecuted without the kind of technicalities which arose in the Waterford case.  Indeed, the dismissal of that case led to great outrage and the public find it very hard to understand how an individual who referred to the person who had brought the complaint as his daughter subsequently denied that she was and that that simple denial was enough to bring the court crashing to its knees.  As the judge saw it, he had no option but to dismiss the case.  Lay people found this inexplicable and could not understand how a simple denial could give the defence the facility which it would have found very difficult to produce otherwise.  Before this Bill is passed it is incumbent on us to ensure that dismissal on a technicality of that nature will not happen again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter tabled quite a number of amendments to later sections which are intended to copperfasten this whole area and to ensure that people accused of child sexual abuse and incest will not have a simple means of having their case dismissed. I am disappointed that Deputy Shatter is not present because, with his qualifications and insight, he is far better qualified than I am to argue in favour of his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there is another side to the case and the Minister said on the previous occasion that one must try to maintain a balance.  We accept that.  The part of this amendment to which the Minister took exception, before the debate adjourned, that &ldquo;such person shall be presumed to be the father of the child unless the contrary <Col N="428" /> is satisfactorily proved&rdquo; puts the onus on the individual to prove that he is not the father of the child.  That would apply in cases such as the Waterford case. The general public would agree that such a provision was acceptable and would contend that if a person made a statement to the effect that he was not the father then the onus should be put on him to prove the statement if necessary.</P>
    <P>Earlier on, the committee also discussed the admissibility of birth certificates. What would be the position in a court case if a birth certificate was produced and the individual who stood accused denied paternity, even though he was named on the birth certificate?  As happened in the recent Waterford case, would a simple denial be accepted as the basis for dismissal of the case?</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has tabled amendments Nos.  25 to 31.  So far as I can determine, Deputy Shatter has borrowed from the Status of Children Act, 1987, to draw up the amendments which he wants introduced into this legislation to give the court the ability to take certain actions and make certain orders to ensure that what happened in Waterford cannot happen again.</P>
    <P>I should not put amendment No. 20 to a vote if I thought the Minister would take the matter seriously and try very hard before Report Stage is finished to have the issue satisfactorily resolved. When the Committee were discussing Deputy McCartan's amendment No. 14, the Minister indicated his willingness to do something to ensure the admissibility of a birth certificate.  I hope he will go further than that and come down part of the road with us at least and agree to ensure that these very difficult cases can be prosecuted in an acceptable way and that the kind of thing that happens occasionally, as instanced by the recent Waterford case, does not recur.  We should make sure that if such cases are lost they are lost for a reason other than a simple technicality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee had a very full and detailed debate on this general proposition on 8 April, When <Col N="429" /> the Committee Stage was last before us. During discussion on amendment No. 14 the Minister undertook to examine the issue positively for Report Stage.  For that reason, I am happy to leave the matter over until Report Stage, when the issue will be examined in more detail.  The point has been made very well in the House that there is a legislative gap in that area and the Minister has undertaken to deal with that.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment about the length of time it has taken for Committee Stage of this Bill to resume.  Initially we were told by the Minister that the matter was urgent as regards two aspects of the law, which emerged in the recent Waterford case and in dealing with child sexual abuse generally.  It is regrettable that it has taken almost six weeks to resume Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy McCartan, but I do not have any responsibility in relation to the timing of legislation or when legislation is brought into the House.  I fully recognise the view expressed by Deputy Cotter that it is unacceptable that people should escape conviction in cases such as the recent Waterford case on a technicality. The other side of the coin is that we should not react in a knee-jerk manner when a particular case received wide publicity in the news media and immediately change the criminal law in relation to that type of case in order to ensure conviction. As I said when we previously discussed the issue, there are arguments for and against revision.  Constitutional difficulties would quickly be encountered were we to adopt the approach suggested by Deputy Shatter and Deputy Cotter.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I realise that there is a great public concern about people being able to escape conviction in cases, such as in the recent Waterford case, on technicalities. We, as legislators, must do our utmost to ensure that such instances recur as infrequently as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy McCartan's amendment No. 14, I did mention before the adjournment of the debate that I was <Col N="430" /> prepared to look sympathetically at his proposal, which sought to ensure the admissibility of birth certificates, to put the matter beyond any doubt.  Deputy Shatter seems worried that even if we were to ensure the admissibility of birth certificates that in itself would not be of any consequence so far as evidence is concerned unless we were to write in some sort of a presumption which an accused would then have to rebut.  I am still not in favour of going as far as actually writing in a rebuttable presumption which an accused would have to rebut, because I feel that it smacks too much of shifting the burden of proof.</P>
    <P>However, we must ensure that once a birth certificate is admitted in evidence that will have some effect.  I have had discussions with the parliamentary draftsman on that issue, and I am glad to be able to assure the House that an amendment designed to take into account the points made by Deputies Shatter, Cotter and McCartan is being prepared and I shall present it to the House on Report Stage.  The amendment will deal not only with the admissibility of birth certificates but will also seek to ensure that a birth certificate has definite evidential value and has to be taken into account once admitted.  I hope that the amendment will meet the fears expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy that the Minister has decided to go at least part of the way with us and take into account all the arguments put in this regard by Deputy McCartan and the rest of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not particularly accept the Minister's comment that hard cases make bad law in his instance.  The intricacy of such cases is well known and our lack of preparedness to deal with this whole area of child sexual abuse is also well known.  It is accepted that we have no research and no background on the issue and that we are trying to find our way forward. Strengthening the law to ensure that the kind of dismissal that happened in the Waterford case will not happen again would be wise in that it would give the public confidence that the law can be applied.  Given the difficulty we face in <Col N="431" /> investigating, because of lack of resources, and in bringing cases before the courts, we should make sure that once a case comes before the courts people are given a fair go.</P>
    <P>I look forward to reading the amendment which the Minister will bring forward. On that basis, I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 20.  When the Minister's amendment comes forward we will decide whether it is acceptable to us.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant development since we spoke here on 8 April, when, as the Minister will recall Deputy Shatter and I made some caustic remarks &mdash; although I endeavoured to save some grace &mdash; about the Incorporated Law Society for their failure to respond to the Bill in any meaningful sense.  Since then no doubt the Minister will have received their detailed, reasoned submission on the Bill.  Perhaps the break was of some benefit.</P>
      <P>The Incorporated Law Society made some useful points to which the Minister might respond in relation to section 8 (1) which reads:</P>
      <P>8.&mdash;(1) In any criminal proceedings information or any part thereof that is admissible in evidence by virtue of section 5 shall not be admitted if the court is of opinion that in the interests of justice the information or that part ought not to be admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister indicate how he envisages such an inquiry would be conducted? For example; will the onus be on the court, of its own motion, to inquire into all applications or will the onus rest on either party, the party moving or the party opposing?  For example, the Incorporated Law Society suggest that, if there was a specific clause inserted in section 7 suggesting that the onus be on the moving party to show clearly the admissibility of <Col N="432" /> the document, that would overcome this difficulty.</P>
    <P>The other point they make is that this provision may well lengthen rather than shorten the duration of a criminal trial because of its complexity and the extent to which a judge, in his consideration may have to range over so many matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make one observation on the manner in which section 8 has been drafted and in which its provisions are intended to operate.  My information is that it is unclear whether the party objecting.  to the admission of a document has the onus to establish its inadmissibility.  Perhaps that could be clarified before we leave the section since such clarification is warranted.  For example, perhaps the onus should be on the party producing the document to satisfy the court as to its admissibility.</P>

      <P>In relation to the points made by Deputy McCartan &mdash; I will look into them &mdash; my understanding is that the court on its own motion, can inquire into this matter.  The court can also do so at the request either of the prosecution or of the defence, as the case may be.  The Deputy has said, and I agree with him, that this may well add to the duration of criminal trials.  That is the price we must pay for this necessary change in the law of evidence.  I was slightly preoccupied and did not quite follow the point Deputy Cotter was making.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) evidence may be admissible under this section by means of the rules set out in this Part, subject <Col N="433" /> to the conditions herein as shall be applicable.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 9 deal with evidence with regard to credibility of a witness. Whenever a witness is giving evidence with regard to fact before the court or is of the opinion, his or her credibility is a matter that can often arise. It is a legitimate procedure, particularly in the case of opinion evidence in the case of experts, to be able to tackle their expertise by testing their credibility or otherwise.  Section 9 applies the general principles of the Bill allowing documentary evidence to be adduced dealing with issues of credibility.  For example, if the prosecution produce a certificate or report from a witness, the opposing party, the defence, can introduce evidence relating simply to the credibility that could have been tested had the witness been in the witness box giving testimony <i>viva voce.</i></P>
    <P>My amendment merely suggests that that evidence that can be produced or adduced under section 9 can also be produced or adduced in the same way as all other testimony in that Part of the Bill, namely, by the use of documentary evidence. If one can give one's evidence in chief and in rebuttal there is no reason &mdash; if one wants to challenge either evidence and can do so conveniently by document in regard to credibility &mdash; one should not be allowed and entitled to do so.  That is what my amendment attempts to do.  It may not be properly drafted or constructed for the purpose and it may not give the sense of what I seek to do in its wording.  In such a technical Bill it may well be covered but, in my view, it is not and should be so stated.  I tabled this amendment for the sake of clarity.</P>
    <P>It is some weeks since we last discussed Committee Stage.  When I looked for my handwritten notes I had prepared at the time to explain why I had tabled this amendment I found they suggested that it was simply on the basis of what is good for the goose should be good for the gander.  If one wishes to introduce evidence challenging credibility it is sensible, and within the spirit of the Bill, that <Col N="434" /> it can be done by way of documentary evidence provided the other conditions stipulated in sections 7 and 8 are complied with.</P>

      <P>I have to confess that, when I saw this amendment this morning, I did not quite know what Deputy McCartan had in mind.  Having heard him I want to clarify exactly what he has in mind.</P>
      <P>This Part deals with documentary evidence. Obviously, a document has to be prepared by somebody.  If I follow Deputy McCartan correctly what he is saying is that, if evidence is to be adduced to challenge the credibility of the person who originally compiled the document, or the person who supplied the information contained in the document, that credibility should be allowed to be challenged by way of document.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash; The Criminal Procedure Act 1967, is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution, for paragraphs (d) and (e) of section 6 (1) of that Act (which provides for the service of documents on an accused), of the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(d) a statement of the evidence that is to be given by each of them,</P>
      <P>(e) a copy of any document containing information which it is proposed to give in evidence by virtue of Part II of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992,</P>
      <P>(f) where appropriate, a copy of a certificate pursuant to section 6 (1) of that Act, and</P>
      <P>(g) a list of exhibits (if any)&rsquo;,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(b) by the substitution, for section 11 of that Act (which provides for service of additional documents on an accused after he has been sent forward for trial), of the following section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;11.  (1) Where the accused has been sent forward for trial the Director of Public Prosecutions shall cause to be served on him a list of any further witnesses whom he proposes to call at the trial, with a statement of the evidence <Col N="436" /> that is to be given by each of them, a list of any further exhibits, a statement of any further evidence that is to be given by any witness whose name appears on the list of witnesses already supplied, any notice of intention to give information contained in a document in evidence pursuant to section 7 (1) (b) of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, together with a copy of the document and any certificate pursuant to section 6 (1) of that Act, and copies of any statement recorded under section 7 and any deposition taken under that section or under section 14.</P>
    <P>(2) Copies of the documents shall also be furnished to the trial court&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the Chair rightly said, this amendment is in substitution of amendments Nos. 22 and 23, and makes two changes in section 10 by incorporating the additions to section 10 proposed by amendments Nos. 22 and 23.  It also re-enacts, with amendments, section 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>First, with regard to the additions to section 10, as the section stands, it provides that the book of evidence served on an accused person before the preliminary examination must include any documents which it is proposed to give in evidence under this Part and any certificate given pursuant to section 6 (1).  Of course, it is not the intention of my Department or of the draftsman, that the original documents or certificates should be served on the accused as these will have to be available for production by the prosecution in court.  Indeed, section 7 (1) recognises this.  Therefore, the effect of the amendment is that copies of the documents, rather than the originals, in question can be served.</P>
    <P>The second change being made by the amendment is to section 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  That section provides for the service of various documents on an accused after he has been returned for trial.  Examples of such documents would be statements by any <Col N="437" /> further witnesses, etc.  It is necessary to provide also for the service of notice of any additional documentary evidence that the prosecutor may wish to adduce at the trial and of any supporting certificate under section 6 (1) of the Bill.  This is achieved by the second part of the amendment.  For convenience of reference the parliamentary draftsman has repeated section 11 of the 1967 Act with the amendments, which I think is more satisfactory then amending by reference. To sum up, the changes proposed in this amendment are consequential on the procedural amendments being made in the law of evidence by the earlier provisions of this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the Minister's amendment.  As he said, it is entirely consequential on the need to expand the procedures for preliminary investigation, etc.  under the 1967 Act.  My amendment No 24 simply proposes to correct what I believed was an error in the original text of the Bill. However, the Minister has repeated this error in his amendment.  Paragraph (f) states that &ldquo;where appropriate, a copy of a certificate pursuant to section 6 (1) of that Act...&rdquo;.  I am concerned about the term &ldquo;that Act&rdquo;.  Section 10 seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  As I understand it, the term &ldquo;that Act&rdquo; is intended to mean the 1992 Act. While, as the Minister said, reference is made to the 1992 Act in paragraph (e) of his amendment I believe that from the point of view of clarity the title of the Act should be repeated in paragraph (f).  That is what I sought to do in my amendment No. 24.</P>

      <P>I understand the point Deputy McCartan is making.  Paragraph (f) of my amendment is immediately preceded by paragraph (e) which refers to &ldquo;a copy of any document containing information which it is proposed to give in evidence by virtue of Part II of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.  Paragraph (f) states that &ldquo;where appropriate, a copy of a certificate pursuant to section 6 (1) of that Act...&rdquo;.  I do not think that the <Col N="438" /> question of the production of certificates, etc. arises under section 6 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  Therefore, the Act referred to must be the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 30 states:</P>
    <P>In page 10, before section 11, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash; (1) Where a court gives a direction under section 12 of this Act and any person fails to take any step <Col N="444" /> required of him for the purpose of giving effect to the direction, the court may draw such inferences, if any, from that fact as appear proper in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>(2) Where in any criminal proceedings in which the parentage of any person falls to be determined by the court hearing those proceedings there is a presumption of paternity relating to an accused, then if a direction is given under section 12 of this Act in those proceedings, and the accused without good cause fails to take any step required of him for the purpose of giving effect to the direction, such failure may be treated as corroboration of the presumption of parentage.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 states:</P>
    <P>In page 10, before section 11, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash; If an accused in respect of whom a direction has been made under section 14 without good cause fails or refuses to comply with such direction, he shall be liable&mdash;</P>

    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £2,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will appreciate why that list of amendments has been introduced by Deputy Shatter.  It goes back to what the Minister described as a hard case &mdash; the Waterford case &mdash; giving the court the power to order blood tests to be taken or forensic evidence to be supplied in a case such as the one referred to so often during this debate.  The amendments have been put down to ensure that a person brought before a court will not easily have his case dismissed by making a simple statement that, as in this case, he is not the father. The court should have the ability to <Col N="445" /> ensure that the case can be proceeded with.  I will comment on this matter later when the Minister has made his submission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it a little surprising that Deputy Shatter should put forward provisions of this kind when the matter of taking blood samples has been already adequately provided for in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, which, admittedly, has not yet been brought into operation.  I suspect that Deputy Shatter may be trying to put psychological pressure on us to bring that legislation into operation.  I am glad to inform the Deputy that I have made urgent representations in this regard and we are trying to have that legislation brought into operation as a matter of urgency.  That is not just parliamentary speak; I envisage that it will be in operation within a very short period of time.</P>
      <P>Under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, the consent of the accused is required for the taking of a DNA test, which will establish paternity. If the accused refuses to consent to the test, because incest, which presumably is the offence Deputy Shatter had in mind when drafting this amendment, is one of the offences for which a person may be detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, then under the terms of that Act certain inferences can be drawn. That is exactly the same as the provision in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990.  Therefore, the provisions in the 1984 Act apply to that offence and those will be the consequences for a person refusing to take a DNA test if requested to do so in proceedings for incest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in the name of Deputy Shatter are extremely complex and I should like more time to study them between now and Report Stage.  If I were to ignore the fact that the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, is about to be brought into operation and take the route suggested by Deputy Shatter in his amendment, I would not be accepting the amendments as proposed here.  For example, I would need clarification <Col N="446" /> on amendment No. 31 in which Deputy Shatter proposes to insert a new section 17, whereby a person who without good cause refuses or fails to comply with a direction to have a test taken, will be subject to some pretty severe penalties. It seems to be ludicrous that if a person refuses to take the test, then only certain inferences can be drawn, but if he consents to take the test and then baulks before the test is taken, he is liable to be prosecuted and he is a criminal and can be convicted.  That seems somewhat unreal.  In considering whether or not to go along the road some distance with Deputy Shatter's proposed amendments I would need clarification on that.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has not dismissed this out of hand.  When the Minister was speaking earlier, he referred to the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1990, and assured the House that DNA testing will soon become a reality.  I assume that one of the things to which Deputy Shatter was trying to draw attention was the fact that it is not a reality. We had a few embarrassing cases which would probably not have occurred had DNA testing been put in place.  For example in what has become known as the Phoenix Park case people are of the opinion that certain individuals got off very lightly because of difficulties with identification.  Had DNA testing been available in that instance things might be a bit different.</P>

      <P>It is a possibility.  The process of producing legislation here because of public demand and then letting it sit and gather dust is likely to bring this House into disrepute.  There are plenty examples of that, for instance, there is the Child Care Act.  Part III of that legislation, which is very important, has still to be ordered by the Minister and it seems that the Minister does not have any intention of doing anything because it would cost money to do so. We would do better not to produce legislation than having it lying about, giving <Col N="447" /> the public the notion that we are only interested in window dressing.  We can point to legislation and say that the House has done this work but because we are short some money it is not being implemented.  When we are talking about the amendments Deputy Shatter has put down, that is one of the matters on which we must focus.  I am happy the Minister has agreed to look at this proposal. Obviously this is quite complex and there are quite a number of amendments involved.  I would be happy if the Minister looked at this to see whether it is possible to use the basic ideas involved in putting together amendments which we might find acceptable.  We must keep reminding ourselves that this legislation will come under severe scrutiny in difficult circumstances and therefore it is extremely important to try to produce the best possible legislation that will stand the test in court.</P>

      <P>Section 12 proposes that evidence should be given through TV link by persons under 17, or by mentally handicapped persons, in physical or sexual abuse cases, unless the court sees good reason for the contrary.  Deputy Shatter proposes to amend that to state that evidence will be given through television link unless the interests of justice otherwise require.  I cannot accept that <Col N="448" /> because the formula proposed by the Government seeks to make it the norm that a TV link should be used in such cases.  That accords with the views of the Law Reform Commission who recommended that the use of closed circuit television or, if that is unavailable, a screen, should be the rule, unless the court for special reasons decided otherwise, and who said it was clear that in many cases the court would have good reason to direct otherwise.  An example given is where a burly 16-year old has been the victim of common assault in a brawl.  There would hardly be need for the provision of evidence through a television link in a case like that.  We all wish to achieve that in any case where a witness would be traumatised by giving evidence in the court room, the witness should be facilitated by a live television link.  If the Deputy has good reasons why we should change the formula, I will consider them.</P>
      <P>I can see a certain logic in what Deputy Shatter is trying to do.  The Deputy is trying to maintain a balance between the rights of the State and the rights of the accused.  Deputy Shatter is not seeking to make it the norm that a television link will not be used.  The Deputy recognises that we want it to be the norm that a television link will be used unless there is some obvious reason why it should not be used.  The formula already in the Bill represents the Government's intentions in this regard better than the formula proposed by Deputy Shatter.  Unless I can hear some good persuasive reason to the contrary, I am not inclined to go along with the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Part III of the Bill is likely to create a lot of difficulties for us.  It has been brought to my attention that a live television link, for instance, has not been defined in the Bill.  People say that it should be defined and that there should be no doubt about it.  Section 12 which refers to a live television link, and other sections, will cause difficulties.  We referred to this on Second Stage.  It would be in our interests to try to foresee the difficulties at this stage.  With regard to <Col N="449" /> this whole procedure of giving evidence through a live television link, what procedures would be followed?  Will the person giving the evidence be able to see the judge and others in the courtroom? One would presume that the judge and everybody else would be able to see and hear the evidence being given.  The section is specific in some aspects, like the requirement that a wig and gown should not be worn by the judge or a lawyer, but it is loose in specifying how the system will operate.  The intention is to make it easier for the immature person to give evidence.  We sympathise with that but we are worried that section 12 is not complete in that it does not provide the definition in many cases.  There is nothing to indicate how the oath is to be administered, for example.  How will it be possible to ensure that a person is not in a position to prompt an individual giving evidence?  Far too much of this section is somewhat mysterious.  It should err on the side of being very specific rather than on the side of being loose and open to all sorts of interpretations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at Deputy Shatter's amendment, and the original format of the section, I would have to come down on the side of the amendment. When one is, as in this Bill, introducing a new evidential format, these things are necessary.  We have to recognise that special circumstances arise when changes in the arrangements for evidence have to be provided and this is one of them. However, when one changes long and well-tried systems of giving evidence, providing safety for an accused person that he is not wrongly convicted on dubious evidence under suspicious circumstances, one has to exercise a great deal of care and caution and examine the matter very closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The well-tried system has evolved over hundreds of years.  The witness or the complainant is in the witness box for all to see.  That person must take the oath and must be subject to cross-examination face to face by the solicitor or counsel for the accused.  The judge, and the jury, if there is one, can monitor and see the demeanour of the witness in the witness <Col N="450" /> box.  They can see whether the witness is under pressure, sweating or fidgeting or discommoded in any way.  What one can see on a television link is rather more limited.  I am not arguing that it should not be brought in.  I recognise that there are exceptional cases where the needs of justice will require it.  We should not be glib and go to the other extreme by bringing in these measures without exercising care in the interests of justice.</P>
    <P>The wording of the section in its original format leaves it subjectively the decision of the judge or court.  Judges can be offhand or casual about these things.  They can take a particular view without giving any explanation.  The judge's decision may be right but he should be obliged to explain it and to put on record the basis of his decision that the television link should or should not be used.  I have some fear about vesting in a subjective manner the complete and utter discretion for this new evidential procedure in the judge alone, unanswerable to anybody, particularly to a court of appeal as to what he did and why.</P>
    <P>The essential distinction between the wording of the original section, which seems not unreasonable on first reading, and the amended wording proposed by Deputy Shatter is that the section as worded puts the test in a subjective manner whereas the amendment puts the test in an objective manner.  We are not talking about what a judge sees fit or sees good reason for.  We are talking about a more objective test, a broader spectrum, the interests of justice.  That is something an appeal court would be entitled to look at.  An appeal court can examine the overall test and decide whether it was proper that the television link evidential arrangement was included or excluded and whether that decision served the overall interests of justice.  It might be very appropriate to do that.</P>
    <P>Judges are a fine body of men and women who do a wonderful job.  They get their decisions right most of the time, but they certainly do not get their decisions right all the time on any issue.  If they <Col N="451" /> did, there would be no need for courts of appeal and no judge would be overruled by a higher court, as they are every day of the week, from the District Court to the High Court.  They can get it wrong and occasionally some judge might get a bee in his bonnet about the issue and allow or disallow the television link.  His decision might be related to the overall interests of justice or it might not.  It is fair enough to say that it should be open to be looked at objectively as to whether it matched the test of being overall in the interests of justice.  That test might be excluded in the original wording of the section.  That overall acid test ought not to be excluded.</P>

      <P>I want to record my appreciation of the fact that there is embodied in the Bill the facility to lessen the trauma and the agony that witnesses often have to go through in appearing in court.  Where child sexual abuse is involved or other such delicate matters, children should not be obliged to experience the intimidatory ambience of a court with judge and jury and wigs and gowns. It is an adult world which is alien to many people.  It is a step in the right direction that the Bill allows for evidence to be given from a more comfortable environment through a television link-up.  It is difficult to discriminate between the amendment in the name of Deputy Shatter and what is embodied in the section. I have examined the terminology used in the Bill which reads: &ldquo;unless the court sees good reason to the contrary&rdquo; and the words which the amendment proposes to substitute: &ldquo;unless the interests of justice otherwise require&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to commission a light rail transit system for the greater Dublin area on a phased basis in order to resolve the current congestion problems, particularly in the inner cordon area of the city; further calls on the Government to seek EC funding for such a project so that it is constructed within a seven-year period on an established timetable for implementation; and further calls on the Government to re-establish the Dublin Transport Authority to oversee these improvements in public passenger services in the Capital.</P>
      <P>It is important at the outset to state exactly what is the problem in the greater Dublin area.  Traffic congestion in Dublin is significantly worsening each year.  The number of vehicles registered in Dublin has increased from 158,000 to 270,000.  This can only grow further.  As regards car ownership, per 1,000 of population, Ireland has approximately 200 cars compared with the European average of 350 cars.  The logical conclusion during the nineties and beyond is that our level of car ownership will rise in line with the European trend.</P>
      <P>In terms of traffic flows, as monitored by Dublin Corporation, the figures show that at morning peaktimes some 55,000 vehicles cross the inner cordon line carrying over 75,000 commuters each day between 7 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. and between 4.30 p.m. and 7 p.m.  Given the growth in population in Dublin, particularly in the suburban areas and the sprawling nature of development in satellite towns around the city these congestion problems will grow over the nineties and the present congestion will deteriorate further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> Dublin Port is the largest port in the State and accounts for 40 per cent of all trade in the Republic.  It employs 5,000 people in the port estate of 800 acres.  It handles 7.5 million tonnes of goods each year.  The problems of increasing traffic congestion have been a major contributory factor in the huge diversion of freight container traffic through the northern corridor.  It is a matter of some disgrace that four out of every ten containers coming to or going from the Republic go through Northern Ireland.  It has been estimated that there is a revenue loss of £56 million to the Dublin region and to the Irish economy.  There is no doubt the traffic congestion problem is having a direct effect in choking Dublin Port.</P>
    <P>The present policy of building large public and private housing estates on the periphery of the city has a dual negative effect on Dublin: first, it increases the level of urban dereliction and inner city decay, and second, it increases the demand for transport services, for commuters to gain access to their places of employment and for shopping purposes. Therefore, the provision of a modern public transport service across the city would not only meet the commuter needs of the people of the greater Dublin area, but would ensure that the city centre would be a more attractive place in which to live.  I strongly believe this issue is at the heart of making inner Dublin a living vibrant city again, Light rail is not only more attractive but is safer and environmentally friendly.  The figures show the population of inner city Dublin has declined from 150,000 in 1971 to 95,000 in 1986.</P>
    <P>Safety is also one of the hidden costs of congestion in Dublin.  The level of motoring accidents in Dublin represents a half of 1 per cent of total gross domestic product or, in simple cash terms, £125 million per year.  It is significant to note that claims against Dublin Bus in 1990 amounted to £10 million.</P>
    <P>The present over-reliance on cars for commuters is the most inefficient form of transport.  Dublin Corporation have carried out a very interesting survey in <Col N="454" /> relation to car occupancy and the use of different modes of transport.  During peak hours the figures show the average occupancy of a car is 1.4 persons; the average occupancy of a bus is 39 persons but for a commuter train the figure is 417 persons per train.  These figures clearly demonstrate the potential impact of a modern mass transit system for Dublin in reducing the number of cars.  It must also be borne in mind that the minimum cost of motorway development in an inner city area is now reckoned to be £17 million per mile.  It is in these contexts that a radical alternative solution must be found to resolving Dublin's transport chaos.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe it is essential that the Dublin Transport Authority, which was set up under the Greater Dublin Transport Authority Bill, 1985, is fundamental to the resolution of Dublin's traffic congestion problems.  It was most regrettable in 1987 that the then Fianna Fáil Government saw fit to abolish it.  It is vital that it is reconstituted and assumes responsibility for all aspects of transport planning and administration in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Currently, as well as Dún Laoghaire Corporation, Dublin County Council, Dublin City Council, the Departments of the Environment, of Tourism, Transport and Communications, and Justice, all play different roles in relation to transport issues in the greater Dublin area. In conjunction with this, Irish Rail and Dublin Bus have no direct interlinking with these authorities.  These organisations report to different Ministers and different Departments, which has led to two consequences: first, <i>ad hoc</i> decision making on a political basis, such as what the former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, decided to do with the Harcourt Street line.  There was no overall plan for the greater Dublin area but rather a politicised decision in his own constituency in the dying days of his term of office and without any reference to a capital allocation; second, it has led, in successive decades, to an endless series of studies because there is no coherent plan. There is paralysis by analysis by virtue of the fact that the Dublin transport study <Col N="455" /> is out of date and we now have the Dublin Transport Initiative, who are to produce their interim report in the autumn and their final report next spring.  That is no substitute for coherent decision making.</P>
    <P>There is an endless series of reports and studies on the transport needs of Dublin.  A variety of academic, transport, architectural, environmental and other experts have concluded that the best way forward is to develop public transport facilities that will displace the need for personal motoring in the capital city.  All similar international studies indicate that the ultimate solution to traffic congestion in large urban areas lies not with catering for increased car numbers through extra road capacity, but rather in attempting to control demand for personal motoring.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that a single transport ministry, combining the roads, haulage and traffic functions of the Department of the Environment with the existing transport section of the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications and the appropriate transport elements of Marine, is the best way to oversee integrated transport policy.</P>
    <P>There are many proposals in the short term that the Dublin Transport Authority could deal with.  The first deals with enforcement.  It is obvious, in this time of rampant and growing criminal activity, that the Garda are at full stretch dealing with increasingly serious criminal activity and have less than adequate resources to deal with parking and traffic offences.  I envisage the Dublin Transport Authority having the staff and resources to augment the work of the Garda traffic corps.</P>
    <P>Revenue from traffic offences could be directly channelled into the Dublin Transport Authority to improve enforcement procedures.  Fines for traffic offences should be increased to a level of £50.  More tow-away and clamping facilities should be introduced to eliminate illegal parking, especially on double yellow lines and clearways.  Only through effective deterrents will the law be observed, both in terms of the more serious offences in bus priority lanes and box junctions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> Fine Gael envisage that traffic management would come under the aegis of the Dublin Transport Authority involving the reassigning of staff from Dublin Corporation.  It would seek to eliminate parking on major routes for traffic passing through the city and replace it by off-street car parking.  Investment would take place in computerised traffic lights on all major intersections in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The DTA could pioneer the greater use of roundabouts instead of traffic lights at larger intersections.  It could also pilot the introduction of &ldquo;tidal flow lanes&rdquo; during peak periods.  This would mean that certain lanes of roadway could be used for different directional traffic for peak flows in morning and evening. Greater priority will have to be given to the buses.  The latest technology &mdash; selective bus detection systems &mdash; allows buses to increase their speeds.  Stopping space, where possible, at bus stops could be increased to at least two bus lengths to enable buses to pull in and out of the main traffic flow.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority will also be given the brief to see if voluntary agreement could be obtained with the retail sector in Dublin to providing off peak period deliveries.  It is estimated that there are some 6,000 retail outlets in Dublin that have to be serviced by 2,200 commercial vehicles for deliveries.  It is essential that delivery times, where possible, take place before 7 a.m.  or after 7 p.m.  This would reduce distribution costs by up to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority should seek to develop car parks on the periphery close to main roads and public transport systems to promote the &ldquo;park and ride&rdquo; concept, as is the case in other European cities.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority would also take responsibility for taxi services, including the licensing system. It is envisaged that they would have a consumer role in relation to monitoring of fare levels and the quality and availability of service levels.  The Carriage Office currently has responsibility for taxi plates in the Dublin area.  This sector has <Col N="457" /> not been liberalised like the road haulage sector, resulting in taxi plates developing a capital value.  It would therefore be the role of the DTA to establish the appropriate level of taxi plates.  They would also have an annual inspection system to maintain uniformity of standards of taxis. Ultimately, consideration should be given to standard specifications for cars so that a certain type of livery would be uniquely available to the Dublin area.  To introduce this, perhaps once off concessions on excise duties could be considered.</P>
    <P>The question of road development has been very controversial.  The eastern by-pass has become not only a transport, but an environmental and political issue.  It is vital that the Dublin Transport Authority, in conjunction with the National Roads Authority and local public representatives, determine the most effective use of road construction and EC funds.  Specifically, the Dublin Transport Authority should take responsibility for the lengthy road openings which cause excessive disruption to commuters. Often these seem unco-ordinated between different companies such as Bord Gáis, ESB, local authorities and Telecom Éireann.  Penalties should be introduced for failure to comply with deadlines and the completion of such works to a satisfactory standard.</P>
    <P>It is clear from all these points that there is a lengthy short to medium term agenda which must be acted upon by a new transport authority in our capital city.  The construction of a modern public transport system will take time and in the interim these decisions cannot be delayed further.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that the long term solution to Dublin's transport problems lies with the construction of a light rail transit system.  This can only be introduced with planning, substantial investment and political determination.  We believe this is the single most important public transport issue facing the Republic in the nineties.  In our view LRT is not only the best solution, but it is also the most inevitable.</P>
    <P>Light rail transit uses the latest technology <Col N="458" /> involving steel wheels on electrically propelled vehicles.  It is the only form of transport that can travel on steep gradients and around sharp curves.  It can operate above or below ground level.  It can operate on different surface treatments, road or rail.  Light rail transit offers the greatest flexibility of any public transport system as it can traverse pedestrianised areas that are historically and environmentally sensitive.</P>
    <P>Light rail transit can provide Dublin with a public transport network to match the success of the DART service from Howth to Bray.  The success of DART has been quite startling.  It has resulted in 7,000 cars being left at home each day. Its success is based on is predictability. Unlike buses that get caught in the very same congestion that motorists seek to avoid.  LRT, because it is on its own dedicated track, can ensure that the commuter will be punctually served. Estimates have shown that the cost of putting a heavy rail system across Dublin, with all the complications of tunnelling, would be too prohibitive in cost.</P>
    <P>Any comparison of traffic flows on DART corridors and elsewhere shows that where the DART exists over 50 per cent of commuters travel by public transport. On non-DART corridors the figures show that less than one in four commuters use public transport.</P>
    <P>It is vital if light rail is to become a reality in Dublin that it is not beset with <i>ad hoc</i> political decisions.  The last Minister responsible for transport participated in this short-sighted messing.  It now transpires that his major announcement on the Harcourt Street line was only a decision in principle without any allied finance.  It is not clear whether a guided busway or a light rail transport facility is to be provided.  Decisions in this regard have more to do with constituency politics than any proper overview of the transport needs of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is symptomatic of this Government's approach that less than 4 per cent of total EC funding from 1989 to 1993 under the Structural Funds is being spent on public transport.  I understand that only two cities, Essen in West Germany and Adelaide <Col N="459" /> in Australia, have opted for a guided busway system.  Over 320 cities worldwide are now adopting an LRT system.  Currently in Britain light rail is being constructed in Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, Newcastle, Edinburgh and is under consideration in many more cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Light rail, I believe, is the most accessible form of transport for the disabled.  It is undoubtedly the safest, cleanest and most user friendly public transport system.  It does not produce any air pollution, as would a busway system.  Light rail transit must, of course, be complemented by a feeder/supplementary transport system, provided by buses to peripheral car parking locations on any LRT system.  I believe that LRT has the best prospect of operating on a break-even or surplus basis on day to day revenue and expenditure.  Light rail transit has low running costs and minimum maintenance requirements.</P>
    <P>The implementation of LRT in Dublin will, of course, be difficult in terms of planning, property acquisition and technical considerations.  I believe, however, that delaying the implementation will only increase costs and add to these difficulties, while in the interim the traffic congestion will worsen.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, Fine Gael are proposing the consideration of three routes: (a) the old Harcourt Street line; (b) a route to the south west, including Tallaght, which would take in Harold's Cross and Kimmage and would operate on property already acquired and designated for transport purposes and (c) a route would run from Finglas to the city centre.  It would run southward from Finglas village through the open area to meet the Sligo mainline, west of Broombridge Station, then link up to Broadstone and enter the city along Dominick Street through Parnell Street to O'Connell Street where it would connect with the first two routes.  Everyone would like to see light rail all over the city, even to Dublin airport but we must prioritise the routes to meet the greatest public transport commuter needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> The minimum cost of the least number of routes would be of the order of £150 million and the total cost of the three routes would be of the order of £400 million.  The only way that such a proposal can become a reality is with European Community funds.  In this regard it should be borne in mind that the next tranche of Structural Funds, from 1994 to 1998, is due to increase by 64 per cent and that the Cohesion Fund, which is specifically earmarked for the states of Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal, is exclusively for transport and environmental projects.  The case for Dublin is on a par with those cases which have been funded by Europe at the rate of 55 per cent in Athens and the British systems in Newcastle and Birmingham.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the Government should immediately prepare a detailed project for submission to the EC Commission. This cannot be done overnight and as the preliminary decisions at European level in this regard are to be taken in the latter half of this year it is imperative that work start now.  This proposal will also involve the diversion of resources away from the construction of roads and motorways in Dublin city towards the construction of public transport.  In this context the eastern by-pass is due to cost £400 million.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to outline the details of proposals made by different private consortia to her predecessor which are gathering dust in the Department.  I am aware of one international group which made a specific proposal, either on an ownership or franchise basis, to provide a light rail public transport system with EC funding, yet, nothing has been done.  Failing this combination of methods &mdash; EC and private sector funds producing the necessary finance further measures can be invoked.  The Dublin Transport Authority could have the power to introduce road pricing.  This would mean that on the inner city cordon there would be a charge to road users.  This could be done by the display of a monthly disc.  The revenue from this could finance public transport facilities.  This method already <Col N="461" /> has a proven track record across Europe.</P>
    <P>I am aware that The Workers' Party and the Progressive Democrats have produced policy papers on the issue of transport in the greater Dublin area.  They, too, have concluded like Fine Gael, that light rail is the best option for Dublin.  We have now reached the time for decisions and, ultimately, it will be a political choice rather than a consultative one through any expert group.  In the short period she has been in office, the Minister has shown signs of procrastination, be it in relation to the broadcasting issue, the Shannon stop-over or funding for public transport.</P>
    <P>We are therefore seeking the support of other parties for the implementation of a modern public transport system up to a European standard for Dublin, This can only be planned and developed through a new structure in Dublin.  It cannot be done solely by CIE, Dublin Corporation or the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications. Therefore, it has to be a new structure. What we are calling for in this motion is the reintroduction of the Dublin Transport Authority and a blueprint for a modern light rail system for Dublin up to a European standard.  This must be implemented and sought at EC level this autumn.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Yates, there is no doubt in my mind that the case for a light rail system in Dublin has been overwhelmingly made not just in this House but in a number of recent studies and investigations.  I wish to pay a special tribute to people who have almost single-handedly during the past few years forced this issue onto the political agenda.  These include Professor Simon Perry of Trinity College, Tom Coffey of the Dublin City Centre Business Association and the people concerned in the &ldquo;People First Dublin Initiative&rdquo;.  These people, who daily witness the disruption caused by traffic congestion, have highlighted the need during the past few years to look at the need for a new integrated transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential requirement that would have to be met in relation to any new <Col N="462" /> light rail system in Dublin city and Dublin county is that it should provide for a relatively free passage through the central core of the city to the suburbs.  It is a known fact that the actual amount of time it takes to travel from A to B is not as important to the commuter as the fact that they know they will get there in a certain amount of time, that they will be guaranteed free passage to wherever they are going and that they will get to their destination without undue delay.</P>
    <P>At present statistics and studies show that only one in 20 cars which enter Dublin city daily carries more than one passenger.  This leads to the creation of traffic jams.  The rate of car ownership in Ireland is one of the lowest, <i>per capita,</i> in Europe at present and is increasing at the rate of 2 per cent to 3 per cent per year but this means, that a very high percentage of Dublin residents, both in the city and county, are obliged to use public transport to get to work, school and vital facilities such as hospitals, health centres, churches and so on.  If the centre of our city, which we all take pride in and love so much, is to survive we need to create strong radial routes to allow people move freely in and out of the city both to work and shop and enjoy the cultural facilities that are being developed in the city.</P>
    <P>A new light rail system in Dublin must form part of an integrated traffic system. I am glad that at a recent meeting of Dublin County Council, which representatives of Bus Átha Cliath and protagonists of a light rail system attended, agreement was reached that any new system must be integrated with the existing DART system and Bus Átha Cliath network.  In relation to the fare structure, we must take into account the fact that people will want to move with ease from one form of transport to another with the same ticket.  This system works extremely effectively in the city of Oslo in Norway where there is an underground system, a light rail system and a bus network.  For the one price one can move from one system to another within a certain period of time without having to buy a second <Col N="463" /> ticket.  This method is extremely effective.</P>
    <P>Although a certain amount of disruption would be caused during construction of a light rail system it would be far less disruptive than any other form of transport such as an underground system or an extension to the DART system. It is also estimated that few properties would have to be demolished as tracks may be laid on existing roads and islands in the middle of the road, in some instances.</P>
    <P>It would also be much more environmentally friendly, rather than increasing the use of standard buses that are in operation now and which form the backbone of the transport system.  I wish to pay tribute to Bus Átha Cliath which has been trying with great difficulty and at great cost during the past few years to extend the bus network by providing a cross county and city service, whereby a person in Ballymun may visit a person living in Mulhuddart if they so wish, as against providing buses to and from &ldquo;An Lar&rdquo;.  These innovations have been introduced to meet the demand of the consumer.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, the carriages used in a light rail system are far lighter than buses.  They weigh around 25 tonnes whereas a standard bus weights between 35 to 40 tonnes.  As we are further aware, up to 400 people can be transported at one time in four carriages in a light rail system.  This is far in excess of the number of people that can be carried in one bus.</P>
    <P>It also has an added safety feature. Carriages are very steady so that both pedestrians and motorists would know that they could move up to within inches of a carriage without fear of being knocked.  One cannot do this in the case of a bus.</P>
    <P>Apart from the cost of £125 million a year, in relation to the cost of accidents in the Dublin area, to which Deputy Yates referred, the estimated cost of the effects of the existing transport system in terms of pollution, stress, fuel cost, wear and tear, time wasted is of the order of £500 million a year.  I have no doubt that the <Col N="464" /> Chair, like the rest of us, has been caught in a traffic jam when he should have been at a meeting and has had to wait for the lights to change 15 times before moving on to his destination.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of introducing a light rail system has been outlined by Deputy Yates.  As stated in our motion, it must be introduced on a phased basis, having regard to the fact that a minimum of 75 per cent of the cost will be available from the Cohesion Fund.  This means that a maximum 25 per cent will have to be provided by the country concerned.  This is the amount that was received by the city of Athens in Greece recently.</P>
    <P>The costs would not be astronomical but, unless we grasp the nettle soon, they will continue to increase.  I agree with Deputy Yates that this is no time for procrastination.  My understanding is that a decision from the Government is required by next September.  Normally, I respect the fact that the Minister makes decisions but, sadly, in relation to this &mdash; and perhaps the Shannon stop-over &mdash; she seems to be procrastinating for fear of the political fallout.  The Minister should make this decision or she will go down in history as one of the Ministers who did not solve the traffic problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In any scheme provision must be made &mdash; not just for the routes about which Deputy Yates spoke &mdash; but around the core of the city linking Connolly, Heuston and the other stations so that someone getting off a train at Heuston can travel to Connolly without having to take a bus and trundle their way along the quays or maybe take a taxi which takes 35 minutes to travel a mile and a half.  The existing infrastructure must be connected but at the same time we should be looking seriously at the extension to Dublin airport.  I know that the airport authorities are very anxious to become involved in this.  Dublin airport is one of the very few EC capitals which does not have an effective, quick and cheap traffic system to bring passengers to and from the airports.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to highlight the need for a transport system to the town of Swords which currently has <Col N="465" /> a population of about 25,000 people. Because of its location, it has been left out of the existing network system.  The council has been very far-sighted in leaving a tunnel of land all the way to Swords to allow for an extension of rail to the town and I have no doubt that the economic benefits of extending to a town that size will be recognised and implemented by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to outline briefly the advantages of a light rail system; it would provide a fast, clean, popular arterial network to the city allowing full integration of all public transport &mdash; buses, heavy rail, DART and taxis.  It would run on time and would not present a pollution problem.  In the long term, it would be the cheapest system to run although, of course, there would be an initial investment cost.  There would be very little demolition of property.  It would substantially reduce the number of cars, allowing greater freedom to other road users, buses, taxis, goods vehicles and cyclists whom we must allow back on our roads.  It would also introduce a system of &ldquo;park and ride&rdquo; on the perimeters of the city; the latest American phrase in that regard is &ldquo;kiss and ride&rdquo;; it means that the spouse leaves his &mdash; or her &mdash; partner to the station and takes the car home.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister, with my colleagues, to make a speedy decision on this matter to prevent Ireland from losing out on her application for the cohesion funds which are available.  If a decision is not made quickly we may lose our slot in the system and the city and county of Dublin will become so jammed with traffic that business and job prospects will be seriously affected.  The introduction of a light rail system should be seen as returning us to the romance of railways.  I am sure that the Minister has enjoyed the romance of the railway line coming from the west.  A new rail system would create a kinetic sculpture running through our city in which we could all live and enjoy it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to contribute to this debate and I am hopeful <Col N="466" /> that the Minister will preside over plans which I accept are long term and expensive but which will provide a network of light rail in Dublin which will give us back our capital city.</P>
      <P>In my childhood I lived on the south side of Dublin and I travelled to the north side to go to school.  I remember those wonderful days when Dublin was a city in which you wanted to meander and window-shop.  At weekends it was the Dublin of Edna O'Brien where young people went to the Metropole to dance. It was a city of wide streets and clearways in which you did not feel afraid, congested or poisoned by pollution.  That Dublin is one that we could still have if we had the type of consistent planning that other cities have had and that this city deserves.</P>
      <P>It is not just a question of Dublin people lobbying for Dublin transport, it is a question of everybody seeing what has happened to Dublin as a national crisis and tragedy.  The capital city is the gem of the country, where most people come, where most commence, whether we like it or not, is centred.  Most foreign visitors come to Dublin.  I have consistently heard people abroad talking about the horrors of Dublin and how awful it is.  I could cry when I realise that it is my city about which they are talking and which I remember with great fondness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not surprising that we have problems in the city of Dublin.  A Dublin Chamber of Commerce report of March 1991 entitled &ldquo;Decongesting Dublin&rdquo;, gives us an indication of the movement that takes place in Dublin, and this has already been referred to by Deputy Yates in another context.  Dublin Corporation's 1989 inner city count indicated that approximately 145,000 persons cross the canal ring in the two hour peak period between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. each day, that cars and commercial vehicles accounted for 52 per cent, 23 per cent travelled by bus, and 11 per cent by rail with the balance travelling by bicycle or walking.  This survey highlighted other factors when vehicle/passenger ratios are analysed.  It indicated that a total of <Col N="467" /> 75,600 passengers travelled in 54,000 cars and commercial vehicles across the canal ring in that two hour period.  This gives an average occupancy of 1.4 persons per vehicle.  The survey also highlighted that in the same period 33,300 passengers were accommodated in 885 buses giving an average occupancy of 37.6 persons per vehicle.  When one compares that figure with an average of 1.4 persons per car, one realises that there is an indisputable case for doing something about public transport and for ensuring that people leave their cars at home and use public transport.  It follows that that can be achieved only by way of the provision of an adequate public transport system.  The report indicates, too, that when allowance is made for equivalent utilisation of road space buses are 14 times more efficient than private vehicles.</P>
    <P>Dublin is besieged by traffic, it is a most unfortunate place to be.  When it is compared with other cities which operate modern transport systems &mdash; Amsterdam, Brussels, London; Glasgow and Montreal for instance, it appears that its development stopped 60 years ago, or, more appropriately, it receded, because 60 years ago there was a tram system in operation in Dublin.  That may not have been the most efficient system in the world, and it might not be efficient in terms of public transport today, but at least it transported large numbers of people cheaply and efficiently to and from their destinations.</P>
    <P>As has been highlighted by the two previous speakers, we do not have a coordinated transport policy for this city. Therefore, a light rail system is essential so that we know the future for Dublin in terms of transport and can plan accordingly. In my constituency there is great need for the re-introduction, extension, of a service on the Harcourt Street line. That line should never have been closed. It was closed down summarily in 1959 leaving the people who relied on it without transport.  The area it served is the most critical in Dublin in terms of public transport.  I regret that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Brennan, who is my <Col N="468" /> colleague in the constituency, confused people considerably by his headline grabbing before he left the Department.  He indicated that there would be a Harcourt Street line, to which £10 million would be allocated.  When that statement was further examined it was recognised that the proposal was to borrow that money from some other area that did not want to give it up and needed it very badly. The previous Minister made that announcement in order to get a headline &mdash; unfortunately, a very cheap headline &mdash; before leaving that portfolio.  His announcement was regrettable.  The people of Dundrum recognise that it was a very cynical move on the part of the Minister and they will not easily forgive him for that.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate is taken seriously.  I hope it is the start of a serious plan for Dublin, because it ill behoves us to ignore this very important resource.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, let me say that I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond to Deputy Yates' motion.  I remind Deputy Yates, although he is a considerably shorter period of time in the House than I am, that he should not accuse me of procrastination because of party political, personal political or parochial political considerations in relation to issues needing consideration within my Department. I ask him to cast his mind back to debates that took place in this House and outside it in 1980 and 1981 and decisions that were made with particular relevance to the portfolio that I had at the time and more especially with particular relevance to my constituency &mdash; decisions that were taken at considerable personal political cost to me.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome Deputy Yates' support and that of his party for the development of a light rail system for Dublin.  All of us who believe that public transport has a very important role to play in the future of Dublin are genuinely excited by the opportunities afforded by this attractive form of public transport, which has been so successful &mdash; as all speakers from the opposite side have said &mdash; in many other European cities.  As part of an integrated public transport strategy, light rail offers an innovative way of addressing some of the major transport problems of Dublin, including traffic congestion, pollution and a decline in the inner city heart of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The transport of people and goods is, of course, a major component in the social, economic and commercial life of a city.  The importance of fast, efficient, cost-effective and environmentally friendly urban transport systems is increasingly being recognised throughout the developed world and particularly in the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public transport and traffic congestion problems of Dublin city are well known and extensively documented. During the 1980s a long period of recession, coupled with sharp increases in car prices and running costs, tended to stabilise the congestion problem.  More recently however, accelerated economic <Col N="470" /> growth and a rise in car ownership have again highlighted the transport problems of Dublin.  It is generally recognised that the main problem in Dublin stems from the inadequacy of its street network to cope with the volumes of traffic wishing to enter the city centre at peak periods. Road based public transport has deteriorated because of congestion, which has encouraged additional commuters to use private transport, causing a spiralling effect.</P>
    <P>Demand for public transport has grown continuously over the past 30 years.  In general, this demand has had to be catered for by the public transport authorities against a background of a structure of roads and railways inherited from the 19th century.  Paradoxically, the roads network is now threatening the commercial dominance of the city centre as a consequence of the congestion of the radial routes which are intended to serve it.  Congestion is now endemic and has spread into the hours between the morning and evening peaks.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been taken by the Government, local authorities and transport operators to address those problems.  Those measures have included the introduction of bus lanes, the extension of the one-way street system, pedestrianised streets, improved traffic and bus fleet management systems and, most significantly, a range of major infrastructural improvements involving the construction of new roads, motorways and bridges and the improvement of existing roads.  In addition, there has been significant expansion of commuter rail services in the past decade, most notably with the commissioning of the DART system in 1984, at a cost of over £100 million, and the development of diesel rail commuter services, including the opening of four new stations in the Maynooth-Dublin line in 1990.  These services will be further enhanced by the delivery to Irish Rail of 17 new diesel railcars over the next two years.</P>
    <P>In my own immediate area of responsibility, the Dublin Transportation Task Force have been working for over a decade to improve road traffic management <Col N="471" /> and to promote and facilitate public transport in Dublin.  The task force comprise representatives of the Dublin local authorities, the city bus and rail companies, the Garda Síochána and the Department of the Environment, the Department of Justice and the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, who chair the task force.  The task force draw on the collective legal, technical and administrative resources of their constituent bodies in pursuing the twin aims of reducing traffic congestion in Dublin particularly at peak times, and facilitating the use of the city's public transport systems.  Their traffic management strategy is geared towards making the most of existing resources by encouraging a switch from private cars to public transport during peak times and reducing traffic congestion at peak times through a combination of improved bus services and the discouragement of all-day parking in the city.  The main features of this &ldquo;carrot and stick&rdquo; approach are measures to improve the quality and reliability of the city bus services through the use of special traffic management and bus priority measures and the introduction of improved controls on city centre parking so as to curtail long-stay parking, reduce congestion and encourage private car users to switch to public transport.</P>
    <P>The main measures pursued as part of that strategy are the introduction of bus lanes; progressive introduction of computerised traffic signal control, including measures for giving priority to buses at traffic lights; closed circuit television monitoring of traffic conditions; enforcement of parking regulations, including bus-coach parking controls; physical planning liaison with local authorities and An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>These measures have shown some degree of success, particularly at local levels.  In particular, the introduction of 72 bus lanes covering approximately 14 kilometres, together with the use of new traffic signalling technology, have resulted in better bus journey times, improved operating costs and increased <Col N="472" /> attractiveness of bus services to the customer. In addition, the introduction of the DART system has shown the way in which a high quality public transport system can attract car users from their cars.  Along the DART corridor, 54 per cent of journeys in the morning peak are made by public transport and 37 per cent by car.  Outside this corridor only 26 per cent of journeys are made by puplic transport while 58 per cent are by car.  The DART experience shows that public transport can make a major positive contribution toward resolving the problems of traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>Dublin city must now face up to the fact that, in common with many other growing cities in Europe and elsewhere, unlimited growth of private car use can no longer be catered for.  It is time for a reassessment of the role of the private car and its place in the city's overall transport policy.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the Dublin Transportation Initiative has been established by the Government. The second phase of the Initiative was announced by the Minister for the Environment earlier this year.  The main features of the second phase are: the development of an effective process for ongoing and integrated transportation planning in the greater Dublin area; the preparation of a long term integrated transportation strategy for the period up to 2011 which will be both practicable and updatable; the production of a medium-term investment and implementation programme for the period 1994 to 1998 based on that strategy.</P>
    <P>Phase 2 of the Initiative has a 15-month work programme, with a final report due in April 1993.  A critical element of that work programme will be the preparation by autumn of this year of an interim report which will be available to form part of the input to negotiations on EC Structural Fund investment for the period 1994 to 1998.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference for phase 2 of the DTI provide for an open approach involving a two-way consultative process between the study team and the general public, institutions and interest groups. <Col N="473" /> There will be substantial public consultation, using market research techniques, discussions with interested bodies, public meetings, invitations to make submissions and other suitable methods.  Indeed this major campaign is now well under way, and 100,000 bus and rail users, 160,000 motorists and 6,000 cyclists are being surveyed, while extensive market research will shortly be carried out among residents, households and pedestrians in the study area.  Last week my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, made a further announcement concerning a series of public information and consultation meetings at 14 centres throughout the city.</P>
    <P>The Government are strongly committed to maximum public participation in the decision-making process at an early stage in phase 2, while options are still genuinely open.  This emphasis will continue into the later stages when strategies are being developed and refined.  In addition to these measures, a local authority committee comprised of local elected representatives and a consultative panel representing transport users and providers forms part of the steering arrangements for phase 2.</P>
    <P>Of course my Department are participating very actively in the Dublin Transportation Initiative, as are CIE. The main focus of my Department's involvement is, naturally, on the public transport side.  I expect that the Initiative, in the context of both their interim report in the autumn and their final report next year, will make radical and innovative proposals to resolve Dublin's traffic congestion problems.  These problems are now so severe that it is extremely difficult for the authorities to provide effective public transport services.  In the course of their work the DTI will evaluate a range of transport policy themes for Dublin, which will ensure that all possible choices are considered.  The modelling and evaluation process will provide a comprehensive and detailed assessment of the transport options for the city.</P>
    <P>One option being examined by the consultants is the development of a city-wide light rail mass transit system.  Such a solution <Col N="474" /> is clearly very attractive and would give Dublin a modern public transport system comparable to those operating in many European cities of similar size.  The major investment which would be required to support such a development clearly is beyond the capacity of the Exchequer either at present or for the foreseeable future.  My Department, as part of their input into the DTI, are also conducting a detailed examination of the possibilities for developing a light rail system for Dublin.  That examination, being carried out with the help of international transport consultants, is well advanced and is addressing the full range of operational, technical, engineering and financial issues involved in the development, construction, operation and financing of a light rail network. These issues include: the form of operation which might be used &mdash; whether segregated or mixed with other traffic &mdash; the need for diversion or modification of underground services; the options for the configuration of the network, location of stations, depots etc; the traffic and traffic management implications particularly in the city centre; the environmental impact of a light rail system; planning issues, including land acquisition; vehicle type and general system specifications; and capital and operating costs.</P>
    <P>Without wishing in any way to prejudge the outcome of the DTI, I believe that there are many advantages for Dublin in light rail technology.  A key advantage is that it incorporates most of the attractive features of traditional rail-based commuter transport systems in terms of reliability, attractiveness to the consumer and environmental acceptability.  It is also significantly less expensive than heavy rail and is most cost-effective where travel demand is at levels which exceed the capacities of a high density bus service but are not such as to require a full metro or heavy suburban railway.  Light rail is technically very flexible, much more so than traditional heavy rail.  This flexibility enables it to penetrate city centre areas without the need for prohibitively expensive tunnelling. Light rail is also readily adaptable <Col N="475" /> to integration with a bus network, thus making a total network of public transport more accessible and more responsive to customer needs.</P>
    <P>I believe that light rail can also make a major contribution towards the achievement of other urban transport objectives.  The presence of the track is in itself a major deterrent to illegal parking. Light rail vehicles can be operated through environmentally-sensitive areas or where other traffic is prohibited.  Low floor vehicles can permit step heights which better anything currently available for buses and which are very much in line with current thinking about access for the very young, the elderly and persons with mobility difficulties.  Deputies may be aware that light rail technology is widely used elsewhere in Europe and that its use and popularity are growing.  My Department have been examining the situation in a number of European cities where light rail systems are currently established or are about to be introduced. As a result of these examinations I am convinced of the proven ability of light rail, first, to attract car users, second, to reduce traffic, third, to relieve the streets of congestion and fourth, to reduce the pressure for car parking space in the city centre.  Light rail systems have also played a significant part in the revival of depressed inner cities in many parts of the world, triggering large-scale pedestrianisation, and bringing passengers directly into commercial city centre areas.</P>
    <P>While accepting that there is a role for light rail in Dublin city, it is important, however, that we should not lose sight of the fact that the bus represents the backbone of Dublin's public transport services.  There is no doubt that the bus network will remain a major carrier, even if a light rail system is implemented. Indeed, the bus will probably continue to be the single most important public transport mode in Dublin for the foreseeable future.  It is important therefore that consideration is given to the integrity of bus routes in whatever new mass transit schemes are proposed, so that each <Col N="476" /> mode can play a complementary role.  I am pleased to note that Bus Átha Cliath are undertaking a number of initiatives to improve bus services, including the introduction of more frequent services using smaller buses and the development of &ldquo;quality bus corridors&rdquo; which will provide a premium service along a number of heavily used routes through a combination of high frequency, new vehicles, staff training, high quality bus shelters, interchange facilities, enhanced time-table/passenger information and priority measures to minimise delays.</P>
    <P>In addition, the proposed legislation on competition in the bus industry &mdash; which I am examining at present &mdash; will liberalise the bus industry with the objective of improving the levels and quality of bus services available to the general public and the introduction of competition on a sensible and orderly basis.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the introduction of any new mass transit systems, such as a combination of light rail and improved bus services, will necessarily require taking some road space away from the private car.  We cannot have it both ways, particularly in the city centre.  Priority for public transport means that the private car must take second place.  This will be more than balanced, however, by the availability of a high quality, efficient and reliable public transport system which will be more attractive to the traveller than the car.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a light rail system for Dublin has many attractions.  Having said that, however, I must emphasise that the single most important factor in relation to the development of a light rail system, or any other mass transit system which may emerge from the recommendations of the DTI, is funding.  Clearly, the capital cost of establishing a light rail network will be very substantial.  Preliminary indications to my Department, from a number of sources, would suggest that the capital cost could be of the order of £300 million or more.  The construction period would depend on the levels of funding available, although construction could be undertaken on a phased basis and part of a system could be operational <Col N="477" /> before completion of the total system, which I think is what Deputy Yates was suggesting.  It is also important to remember in this context that the development of a light rail system for Dublin would have disruptive effects in the city during its construction period, including the limiting of road space on certain routes, the diversion of traffic and the rerouting of underground services and utilities.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be well aware of the many competing demands on the scarce resources of the Exchequer.  It is clear that such a major investment is beyond the capacity of those resources.  Even allowing for the possibility of some investment by the private sector in the development of a light rail system for Dublin, it is clear that it would be necessary to secure major financial assistance from the EC if such a system or some alternative mass transit system for Dublin is to go ahead.  I would suggest this is yet another indication of the importance for this country and its people of a resounding yes vote in the Maastricht referendum on 18 June.  I am confident that the people of Ireland will indeed massively endorse Maastricht.  I can assure this House that I will spare no effort in campaigning for the EC funding to ensure that, by the end of this decade, the people of Dublin will have a modern public transport system comparable with those enjoyed by many of our fellow Europeans in the major cities of the European Community.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Dublin Transportation Initiative is adopting a comprehensive approach to the whole range of issues involved in transport, traffic congestion and public transport in Dublin.  As part of that approach, the initiative will be addressing the development of a process for ongoing and integrated transport planning for the Dublin area.  This work will also include an evaluation of the institutional arrangements which should apply to the future development of public transport in Dublin.  With regard to the re-establishment of a Dublin Transport Authority, I would prefer to await the conclusions of the DTI before taking up a definitive position on the issue.</P>

      <P>I beg the indulgence of the House if I am somewhat more parochial in my contribution than the Minister.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss again the commuter rail system for the greater Dublin area.  I congratulate Deputy Yates on bringing this motion before the House.  He was surprised when I congratulated him on the last occasion he brought a similar motion before the House.</P>
      <P>On the previous occasion when we discussed the rail network in Dublin and the greater Dublin area I said it was a great pity Deputy Yates had not been in a position of some authority in his party during the early eighties.  Having campaigned, particularly in the 1979 local elections, for the DART to be extended to Greystones unfortunately the first thing the Deputy's party did when they assumed power was to chop the decision to extend rail electrification to Greystones. I graciously acknowledge the fact that Deputy Yates recognises the massiveness of that particular sin and I believe that if he had been in office at that time &mdash; perhaps he will be in office as some time in the future &mdash; he would have reversed that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I was reminded today by no less a person than the chairman of CIE that that decision was compounded by an extraordinary fallacy in the document <i>Building on Reality:</i> I make a parody of it &mdash; it should have been called &ldquo;Building Unreality&rdquo;.  If Deputy Yates or any of his colleagues wish to reach into the dusty archives of their shelves and dust off that document they will see that a decision was made at that time to cancel not just the extension of rail electrification to Greystones but to cancel all investments in rail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be easy to make political capital out of an issue like this one.  However, I do not intend to do so because I do not <Col N="479" /> think the decisions made by my party when they returned to Government were any more enlightened.  I find myself very much on a lone track from the far distant reaches of Greystones arguing the case not just for an extension of rail electrification to Greystones but for an examination of the rail electrification possibilities elsewhere in the city.  I am very pleased that in a sense the clock has turned right around and that we are all <i>ad idem</i> on the issue of investment in light rail and further rail electrification. I believe the approach outlined by the Minister is the sensible one.  Obviously we cannot just endorse a particular option as a matter of fashion at any point; there are very many options, all of which should be explored.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the decisions taken in relation to the DART, decisions which I felt at the time were flaws not just in political planning but flaws in terms of planning both in the Department of Finance, who were opposed to the extension of the DART, and the Department of Transport and Power, as it was then, and CIE.  I have acknowledged already that my party when they returned to power did not do a great deal better than had been done before them.  The combination of these decisions meant that we had a partially operating DART system.  This was a tragedy because one of the great successes in public investment in the past ten or 15 years has been the DART.  A sum of £114 million was invested in this system.  This obviated the need to invest some multiple of that sum in road transport and other options.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to take the view, as is often taken, that we have not put money into the rail network as a whole. It is worthwhile reminding the House that during the past decade a sum of £940 million of taxpayers' money has been invested in the railways in one form or another &mdash; usually the money is invested in the form of a subsidy &mdash; and over £230 million has been put into capital services. However, we have failed dismally to put money into the rolling stock, particularly the light rail rolling stock.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> A positive decision was taken by the Government during the past year and a half to allocate £80 million for rolling stock.  Iarnród Éireann rightly point out that they have been starved of funds in this area for some time.  I noted with some considerable alarm &mdash; I hope I will be forgiven for being parochial on this point &mdash; a statement that Iarnród Éireann have not yet made a decision concerning the allocation of the new rail cars.  I should like to remind the House again that when the £80 million was allocated for rail cars at my prompting and the prompting of all Deputies from County Wicklow, the then Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, made specific reference to the allocation of a portion of that money to upgrade the rolling stock on the Bray-Greystones line.  Deputy Yates acknowledged this point on the last occasion he spoke on this issue in the House.  I do not apologise for being parochial; I am simply making the point to CIE and anyone else who cares to listen that even if they have forgotten the promise, the people in Greystones have not.  I wish to reiterate that the Government made specific reference to upgrading the rolling stock in the Bray-Greystones area.  I, for one, will be putting pressure on CIE, as was done today, to honour that commitment.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Dublin and the surrounding areas require a very significant level of investment in all forms of public transport.  The only real investment made in modern times was the £114 million spent on the DART.  That was a very worthwhile investment but it did not go far enough.  I said at the time it was tragic that the system was not extended both south and north.  While such an extension would have required only very little additional funds at that time it would require a considerable amount of money at this stage.</P>
    <P>In recent times I have been disturbed &mdash; I am sure people interested in rail and commuter mass transit have been equally disturbed &mdash; by the carping from some quarters, particularly by those west of the Shannon who have been making a particular point, that the DART is <Col N="481" /> making a loss.  The loss is entirely a bookkeeping figure.  Direct decisions taken by successive Governments inflated the cost of the DART to £114 million.  The specific decisions made by Governments to effectively divert cheap interest loans from the DART are discounted.  If we also discount increases in VAT rates during the period of the construction of the DART, the cost structure of the DART would be very considerably enhanced and its very real economic return would be enhanced.  If one adds in the other benefits, particularly the displacement of commuters along that network &mdash; the Minister said that 54 per cent of the commuters on the DART line come into town on public transport, which is a very positive point &mdash; clearly the economic benefits of the DART are manifest to us all.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the suggestion made in the motion that we should simply opt for a light rail system is the wisest.  There are a number of priorities which come before that.  I do not disagree with the light rail option.  Such an option would be an inspiration in the inner city area and would change the whole nature of commuter transport.  As I have already said, I have certain priorities and people living on other sides of the city have other priorities.  I believe the first and cheapest priority would be to extend the DART line southwards.  The second priority must be the linking of the western suburbs and, in particular, Tallaght and Clondalkin, into the DART network.  I do not mind if this is done by an extension of the DART network to the west, which would cost approximately £40 million, or a light rail system.  It is obvious that the huge number of commuters in that western belt have to be serviced.  Another priority must be a link to Dublin Airport. I note that Iarnród Éireann and Aer Rianta recently completed a study which suggested that covering those northern suburbs, bringing them into the DART line and linking them to the airport, would cost approximately £30 million.  I believe this would be an investment well worth undertaking.</P>
    <P>The fourth priority is the reopening <Col N="482" /> of the Harcourt Street line.  It has been suggested that there should be a bus lane system from the city centre out as far as Sandyford.  Such a development would cost a great deal of money and I suggest we should go a step further.  Very inspired proposals were produced by a private group in the city called the DART 2 proposals which would involve a State subsidy for each person carried and which would have involved an input of private capital.  I suggest that that fourth priority is well worth looking at.  One of the things which distresses me is that up until very recently the line was effectively intact. There was some private building on the line but the first major public encroachment on the line was the N11 which severed the line close to Loughlinstown Hospital.  Nevertheless it would still be possible for a light rail or DART system to be extended along that line.  If the DTI and the Department are considering reopening the Harcourt Street line I would strongly suggest that they should reopen the entire line.</P>
    <P>The fifth priority must be some form of circular public transport system within the area of the two canals.  This is where I would see the light rail system becoming a real option &mdash; I am not sure if that is exactly what Deputy Yates has in mind. The first set of priorities must be to improve the general public transport system from the outer suburbs.  If commuters are tempted to take their cars &mdash; as happens everyday on the Bray-Greystones route &mdash; they will drive all the way into the city.  Therefore, the first priority must be to service all the outer suburbs and then we can consider the inner city.  A light rail network in that context has a great deal to commend it.  I suggest to Deputy Yates that the amended motion, as has been expounded by the Minister, is the more acceptable one.  I think the Deputy knows that that is likely to be the sort of proposal the DTI will come up with.  Notwithstanding the criticism, I would like to once again congratulate Deputy Yates on being a novelty in his party, somebody who is convinced as to the benefits of a mass <Col N="483" /> transit system.  It is a pity he was not around ten years ago.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Yates for bringing this Private Members' motion before the House, as it gives us an opportunity of putting on the record proposals from the Labour Party document on transport development for economic growth in Dublin, a policy document drawn up by Labour Party members, councillors and Deputies in the greater Dublin area, including Mr. Barry Desmond, MEP.  I had great pleasure in visiting Brussels in November 1991 to present this report to Bruce Millan and his group for consideration for the next phase of the Structural Fund.</P>
      <P>I welcome the commitment made by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to the whole concept of a light rail system I hope she will have sufficient influence in Government to ensure that that becomes a reality. However, I question whether or not we can trust this Government in relation to public transport.  Let us consider the case put forward in relation to the 1989-93 Structural Funds from the EC; £615 million was allocated for roads while £30 million was allocated for public transport, a ratio of 17:1 in favour of roads, which must be compared with some of the progressive cities in Europe, for example, Germany, where the ratio is 4:1 in favour of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated her commitment to public transport, but the people in the greater Dublin area and in the country at large are well aware of the lack of commitment to public transport. The Minister said that 17 new carriages had been constructed and came on stream over the last two years but she did not refer to the lack of carriages in the last few years throughout the country, which results in commuters who would <Col N="484" /> otherwise use real transport using the roads, thereby causing congestion.  The Minister did not refer to the report that had been on her predecessor's desk since 1988 in which the board of CIE stated that there was a need for 47 rail carriages to meet the needs of the future.  That report lay on the Minister's desk until 1991 when another commitment was made.</P>
    <P>When talking about public transport we must consider all aspects of life, including employment.  It is a scandal that this Government allowed a viable coach building industry in Dublin to go to the wall.  If a commitment had been made in 1988 or 1989, that industry would have continued in operation in Inchicore, providing employment for the next four or five years.  That work is now being done by Japanese people, which is an utter scandal.</P>
    <P>In our policy document the Labour Party believe there is need for a co-ordinated transport system.  We are referring to a light rail system, but we are also talking about the rail and bus system, all of which must be considered together. The development of transportation in the greater Dublin area needs to be formulated in the context of broad policy principles.  The Labour Party put forward their proposals to the European Commission last October.  Transportation investment and transportation management and control are crucial determinants of economic and social development in a modern urban environment. We believe that public transport development must be the primary focus for investment and management in Dublin for the foreseeable future.  This is suggested by the experience of other major cities which have successfully pursued such a policy, and is dictated by the consideration that a sustained development of our transport infrastructure over many years, geared principally to the requirements of private cars and their owners, has created the traffic congestion and inefficiency which is stifling the economic and social development of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In developing public transport in Dublin, which regrettably is by now a <Col N="485" /> sprawling conurbation, we must address the needs of people and business in all regions of the city.  I refer to the policy in the past of transferring people from communities in the heart of the city to areas such as Tallaght and Clondalkin. In Blanchardstown in my constituency there is 70 to 80 per cent unemployment. People cannot afford to go into the city to work or to visit their relatives.  For that reason a proper policy is needed. Unemployment in Dublin has reached crisis proportions &mdash; 75 per cent of jobs lost in Ireland during the eighties were in Dublin.  There are large, densely populated areas of our city which lack a minimal acceptable public transport infrastructure, which is crucial to the economic revival of the areas to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The question may be asked, if we provide a service will people use it?  Our only effective mass rapid transport system, the DART, benefits 30 per cent of people in the Dublin region.  It has shown that where an efficient reliable service is provided, people will use it.  When cars are taken off the road it will in the long term benefit our economy and our city.  The benefits of efficient mass public transport must be brought as a priority to the growing and economically disadvantaged regions in the western, north-western, south-western and southern areas of Dublin.  The development, control and management of transportation in Dublin must be provided through a unified transport authority.  I support Deputy Yates concept of a transport committee.</P>
    <P>In every major city throughout the world, public transport infrastructure receives continuing subsidies from national exchequers.  These subsidies, which are given to road and rail systems alike, are part of the continuing infrastructural investment which governments must make for desirable economic and social purposes.</P>
    <P>Such continuing subsidies, which in Ireland at present are well below levels applied in other countries, must be taken into account in transport investment planning for Dublin.  To regard public transport subsidies for mass rail and bus <Col N="486" /> transport as reflecting adversely on the management of these services, with no like consideration being given to the continuing subsidies required for road transport, is one of the fallacies which has undermined public transport development in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In evaluating transport investment options for Dublin, and, particularly, in assessing rail versus road options, the true costs and relative efficiencies of comparative systems must be taken into consideration. The capital investment and operating costs of rail systems and the revenues required to offset those costs can be readily computed.  The capital costs of road developments can likewise be computed, but their continuing and consequential costs are almost invariably ignored, not being readily amenable to precise computation.  Public transport is not considered on the same wavelength as road transport.</P>
    <P>While the economic development of Dublin is a prime objective of policy, it must also evolve as an attractive living environment.  Dublin has outstanding natural position and amenities, a substantial man-made heritage, and immense potential.  The development of the city during the past 50 years has frequently been insensitive to the unique character of our capital, with consequences which most Dubliners regret.</P>
    <P>It is essential that in planning for the future development of Dublin and, specifically, in transport planning, the nature of our city and of our inheritance should be fully respected.  Thus, as the Labour Party in Dublin in the seventies actively campaigned against the siting of an oil refinery in Dublin Bay, we will likewise oppose other developments which have adverse consequences for the character and amenities of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion in Dublin has reached terminal proportions.  An almost exclusive preoccupation with providing for private car/truck transport over decades combined with a corresponding failure to develop a public transport alternative has had serious economic, social and enviromental consequences for Dubliners. <Col N="487" /> This has stifled development in the central area of the city and impeded offsetting development of the peripheral new towns.</P>
    <P>There is a growing consensus for change amongst political and other groups in Dublin.  The Labour Party are part of the consensus seeking the development of our public transport infrastructure; the regulation of car access to the city, and urgent action to address the capital's transport problems.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party strongly support investment in and urgent development of a light rail transport system for Dublin with the inherent advantages of such systems. Road developments, while necessary for the future as in the past, have received more than their due share of infrastructural investment resources over the years while public transport development has been starved.</P>
    <P>The eastern bypass motorway is an ill considered proposal and should be struck from the agenda.  It would be environmentally disastrous, and other options should be pursued to relieve traffic congestion on Dublin's coastal belt and to improve port access.  The Labour Party will continue to oppose the eastern bypass motorway under any guise.</P>
    <P>Dublin's bus services will continue to be a crucial part of the city's transport network.  While the guided bus system, being advocated by Dublin Bus management, does not provide the solution to the city's problems, all Dubliners have an important stake in enhancing the efficiency of the city's bus service.  The scope for such enhancement may be limited until a network such as LRT is up and running.</P>
    <P>I compliment the management of Dublin Bus who in recent years improved the efficiency of the services by introducing. for instance the nipper bus services into various areas of County Dublin, including the rural areas of north County Dublin.  I hope Dublin Bus will get the commitment they require if they are to meet their mandate of providing a social service for the community.  There are living communities in the rural areas <Col N="488" /> around the city.  We cannot ask Dublin Bus to provide a service there on economic grounds.  Social aspects must be considered and enhanced in this new Bill. The Labour Party will be seeking to ensure that a social commitment is included in any legislation that comes forward.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party firmly support investment in and development of LRT for Dublin along lines as recently proposed by various interested parties.  The system needs to be set up on an urgent basis and the political will to solve Dublin's traffic and consequent economic, social and environmental problems is the main determinant in ensuring that it happens.</P>
    <P>The budgetary difficulties of the Irish Exchequer are fully understood.  But we shall only emerge from these difficulties via better than average economic growth and transport development in Dublin is essential to this growth.</P>
    <P>Innovative financing approaches may be required to generate the funding needed for an LRT and other public transport developments.  But one does not deal with a crisis by continuing with the policies which gave rise to it.  The commitment, political will and resources of the Irish Government will be needed to establish a light rail transport system for Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Socialist Group and the Labour Party have already sought the approval of the Commission of the European Communities for the application of Structural Funds to enable this LRT system to be progressed.  Agreement in principle is requested of the Commission by the earliest possible date to allow planning for this project to be set in motion.</P>
    <P>Dublin's economic and demographic development over the last 30 years has led to a total mismatch between resources, especially people and economic opportunities.  The major office developments in the inner city have provided white collar jobs for the carowning, suburban-dwelling middle income group thus contributing greatly to traffic congestion and to consequent city centre decay.  Anyone going through <Col N="489" /> Dublin experiences the congestion and traffic back-up on all routes into the city centre.  There was a time when there was a valley period and one could get through the city relatively quickly but those days have long gone.  That is another encouragement to deal with this problem.  The inadequacy, unreliability and high cost of public transport links either to city centre jobs or to the new industrial estates place an almost insurmountable barrier to reducing unemployment by matching people in greatest need with the jobs available.  Transport conditions in Dublin are without doubt an increasingly damaging and destructive factor in preventing the economic development of this region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor argued that we are changing fundamentally the tried and tested system whereby a witness goes into a witness box in full view of the courtroom and is questioned in the presence of the judge, jury and counsel.  Deputy Taylor's contention is that since we are making such a radical change he would prefer the more conservative formula suggested by Deputy Shatter's amendment that the judge should not allow evidence to be taken by television link unless the interests of justice require it.  As the Bill stands, the judge is obliged to do this unless there is good reason for not doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to a small minority of witnesses <Col N="490" /> in criminal trials.  Part III of the legislation applies only when the witness is under the age of 17.  That would be a very small percentage of witnesses in criminal trials.  Secondly, it applies to a limited, narrow category of offences.  We may be making a fairly fundamental change in the rules of evidence but we are doing so only in respect of a small percentage of the total number of people who will be giving evidence and only in relation to a tiny percentage of the totality of offences in which criminal proceedings are brought.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the change we are making in the giving of evidence under Part III will unduly prejudice an accused. If it is shown that this is in some way prejudicial to the accused or if it results in people being convicted who plainly should not have been convicted, the Government will move very quickly to change the legislation.  I do not envisage that this will be the case, particularly in the light of international experience.  This system operates without any great objection in most civilised countries.  It is not the intention of the Government to make the accused more vulnerable or to bring about a situation where the accused in certain types of cases will almost certainly be convicted.  Our intention is to protect vulnerable witnesses in relation to accusations of particularly nasty types of offences.  That is the thinking behind the section.  We are also trying to ensure that the trauma which these vulnerable victims may be made to suffer will not be such as to enable the guilty to go free, as has happened in many cases in the past.</P>
    <P>I should like the Judiciary in this matter to take their responsibility seriously.  If a court simply decides to use the television link even if it plainly should not be used, that will have to be recognised and taken on board by the Government.  I do not envisage that it will happen.  It has come to my attention, although perhaps not to the attention of Deputy Taylor, that some judges have been very quick to go public, not necessarily in the media but when speaking in a private capacity, saying that they find this part of the legislation seriously objectionable and are not <Col N="491" /> prepared to put it into effect.  We want to ensure that they will do so.  We do not want to give them a formula such as &ldquo;the interests of justice&rdquo; to hide behind.  We want to make it plain that the use of this equipment in such cases and for such witnesses will be the norm, unless there is some good and obvious reason why it should not be.</P>
    <P>It has also been brought to my attention that the higher one goes in the judicial system the greater the expressions of reluctance seem to be. Hence Deputy Taylor's point about appeals is not valid.  He made the point that judges do not always get their decisions right and the more points of law on which a person can appeal the better. Experience in this country and in the United Kingdom has shown that the courts of appeal do not always get it right either.  In many cases the trial court was right and the court of appeal was wrong. There is no rule that the court of appeal must be right more often than the court of trial.  We want to ensure that the higher echelons of the Judiciary in the courts of appeal do not take it upon themselves to hinder in any way the development of this system for vulnerable witnesses in these types of cases by overruling conviction after conviction on the basis that the television link evidence should not have been used.  We want to make it crystal clear that this is to be the norm in this type of case.  For that reason I could not accept Deputy Taylor's argument.  I am not anxious to give any judge who may be reluctant to use this system a formula to hide behind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cotter questioned what constitutes a live television link.  The United Kingdom legislation uses the phrase &ldquo;live television link&rdquo; in section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1988.  I am far from suggesting that just because the British do it it is right and we should follow the British system slavishly.  I would point out, however, that the British system is very similar to ours and their experience is that the non-definition of that phrase &ldquo;live television link&rdquo; has caused no problems there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> Deputy Cotter asked how this system will work in practice.  A demonstration of these facilities took place in the Four Courts on 29 April, 1922 at 4 p.m.  I arranged for Deputy Shatter, Deputy McCartan and other Opposition spokesmen to be invited because they had said they would like to see how it worked in practice.  The demonstration took place in Court No. 4 in the Four Courts and was given by AEL Video (Ireland) Ltd. Representatives of the Judiciary, the Bar and the Law Society were present, as were Deputies Máirín Quill and Alan Shatter.  Deputy McCartan was unavoidably absent as he had to be in London for the Judith Ward appeal.</P>
    <P>The system provides a separate monitor for the judge covering the witness room.  It was suggested by some of those present that this would not be enough. Counsel should, they said, also have a similar monitor at their table, so that they too could be reassured that nothing irregular, such as prompting by gestures, was taking place.  It was also said that the judge's separate monitor was inadequate in that, while it would show five-sixths of the witness room, it would not be detailed enough to indicate any &ldquo;prompting&rdquo; by an intermediary of a child witness.</P>
    <P>In discussions with the firm's representatives afterwards, the Department of Justice said they would wish to have an additional monitor covering the witness room for counsel's table.  They also said that they would want two &ldquo;surveillance&rdquo; cameras in the witness room.  One would (as in the demonstration) cover the witness room or most of it.  The other would cover the witness and any intermediary, so that any irregularity on the part of the intermediary could be detached.  A switch on the monitor would select whichever camera the judge or counsel wished to operate.  There is of course also a camera in the witness room giving continuous coverage of the head and shoulders of the witness and replayed to the large-scale monitors in the courtroom. The firm's representative said that there would be no difficulty in making these modifications.  From the point of view that we are getting the technical <Col N="493" /> facilities right we are making this as close as possible to the actual proceedings that take place in a courtroom so that every relevant person can see everything.  My inclination is to let the formula in the Bill stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State went to the trouble of visiting the Four Courts and that he put certain people through the procedure.  I am glad people are concerned about this and the following sections because this procedure is entirely new to us.  Naturally those who are delivering justice in the courtrooms are anxious that whatever procedures are introduced should be operable and justice should continue to be seen to be done on both sides of the fence, by the accused as well as the prosecutor.</P>
      <P>We must continue to look closely at section 12 and the following sections with a view to teasing them out and getting the Minister to focus on possible difficulties.  The Minister should try to satisfy both himself and us that there will be difficulty on the ground when the first of these cases is being heard. The legal people are concerned because the old system, whereby people give evidence and are cross-examined which has been tried and tested for a long time, is working well and generally speaking the results are fair.  When we propose moving into a new situation it must be examined from all sides to ensure we foresee at least some of the difficulties that will arise.</P>

      <P>This amendment is worthy of consideration and support from this side of the House.  The wording of Deputy Shatter's amendment is preferable. It reflects an overall working principle that the interests of justice be served.  I have no strong view on it.  It is the formula of words used time and again when one is dealing with procedural matters. It is the other side of the coin of the wording contained in the subsection.  If the court sees good reason to the contrary it is, in effect, finding that the interests of justice are not necessarily served and that, therefore, a ruling should be given one way or the other.  My inclination is that the words contained in the amendment &ldquo;unless the interests of justice otherwise require&rdquo; should by and large, be the formula employed in these circumstances. Otherwise I have no particular view on the matter.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 34 in the name of Deputy McCartan.  Amendment No. 34 is consequential on amendment No. 60 and amendment No. 34a is an alternative to amendment No. 34.  I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 34, 34a and 60 together if that is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is agreeable.  I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 17 to 20, to delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete subsection (3), which is the Minister's <Col N="495" /> ruling, as it seems necessary for this Legislature to rule in matters of this sort and that wigs and gowns should not be worn during proceedings of this sort.  The purpose in wishing to delete that subsection is not in any way to frustrate the objectives of the Minister as it might seem.  As the Ceann Comhairle has correctly pointed out, amendment No. 60 in my name, which seeks to insert a new section, proposes a far wider proposition as follows:</P>
    <P>During the proceedings of any offence under Part III of this Act, including any preliminary proceedings, wigs and gowns shall not be worn by any judge, barrister or solicitor involved in any way in the said proceedings.</P>
    <P>I am not confining it to proceedings by way of television.  Time and again in this House we have had discussion on the desirability of wigs and gowns being used. In sensitive cases, in particular, where one is dealing with young people, or attempting to deal with matters that have to be handled in a gentle and humane way, certainly in matrimonial type proceedings, we have legislated that wigs and gowns and other paraphernalia of an alienating sort must be dispensed with. We have gone a little further in arguing that in matrimonial proceedings special courts should be assembled in buildings which are conducive to the nature of those proceedings.  I am applying that general idea and principle to all proceedings under Part III of the Bill which, by and large, deals with proceedings relating to sexual offences, offences of assault, offences involving young people, children with impairment or witnesses with mental impairment or otherwise.  As in matrimonial proceedings, there is need for a more humane and caring approach and for those reasons wigs and gowns are inappropriate.  Those paraphernalia should not apply, not just for the televising of proceedings but for all proceedings under Part III.</P>
    <P>It may seem remarkable to an outsider listening to this debate, first, that in this <Col N="496" /> day and age men and women wear wigs on top of their hair.  I saw a comment in a national newspaper recently by the redoubtable and former Member of this House, Mr. McDowell, that if there were to be a blanket prohibition on wigs a certain venerable member of the Upper House might have difficulty in coming into court &mdash; no names mentioned but I think we all know who I am talking about. To that extent I had better be careful in how I word my later amendment.  I may have to address amendment No. 60 when we come to it.</P>
    <P>In talking about wigs we clearly mean the artificial object of horse hair fixed so curiously and so anachronistically on the crowns of men and women who enter our courts and are addressed as barristers.  I know I am addressing a member of the Bar across the Chamber this evening and I hope I am in no way offending his sensibilities in talking about this.  I anticipate that a member of the Bar who is much more in touch with the real world than many who circulate in the august circles of the Round Hall will appreciate the importance of this amendment.</P>
    <P>The curious thing is that this phenomenon exists.  The second curious thing is that we, as legislators, in attempting to introduce some level of sanity and order touching on reality, must introduce into our laws a provision such as this.  It is remarkable in the extreme that, in this day and age, members of the Bar have not come to the realisation and made these decisions for themselves.  It is remarkable that this legislature must, in the latter half of the 20th century, give time to write into our legislation provisions dictating to the Bar and the legal profession how they should conduct and dress themselves in their own courts. It is a matter of some regret that we must deal with this matter here tonight.  My proposal is broader than that contained in subsection (3).  I am proposing its deletion in favour of my later amendment. I do not want to seem to do down the good intentions of subsection (3).  I am saying that for the purposes of these proceedings by television or otherwise <Col N="497" /> normal dress and decorum should apply in our courts, minus the wig and gown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, and Deputy McCartan, seem to have no problem with the word &ldquo;wig&rdquo;.  Both, in their previous capacities, would have experience of the use of the wig in a particular setting.  However, to a layman like myself there is a certain ambiguity in the use of the word &ldquo;wig&rdquo;.  Could it not happen that a solicitor or counsel going into such a hearing could be called upon to remove a wig that he or she wears at all public occasions?  Should we not, therefore, ask the Minister, and Deputy McCartan, to think again about the use of the word &ldquo;wig&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a few words on the use of wigs and gowns.  Maybe we could get over the problem by spelling the word with a capital &ldquo;W&rdquo;.  The wearing of wigs and gowns is a very archaic custom.  Most members of the public are, at most, occasional visitors to our courts which are impersonal and frightening places generally speaking.  The business of wearing wigs and gowns is a throwback to an earlier age.  When I started teaching in the mid-sixties it was the done thing for a teacher to wear a gown.  We did not wear the old mortar board in the school I was teaching in but we all wore a gown. In the more informal seventies it became unfashionable quite quickly.  One rarely sees teachers at second level wearing a gown and one certainly does not see any of them wearing a gown and mortar board.  Times have changed.  I wonder whether keeping the wigs and gowns is just continuing a habit or if there is more significance to it than that.  It certainly sets people apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that, in the circumstances covered by this legislation, they should be barred because they upset most ordinary people, never mind the immature people referred to in this section.  I hope the informality of the age we are living in will drift into the great halls of the Four Courts and other courts and that people will desist from wearing wigs and gowns.  It certainly will not <Col N="498" /> disimprove the delivery of justice.  It is more fitting, in today's world, that barristers should desist from wearing wigs and gowns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy with Deputy McCartan's point of view. One beneficial effect of the wearing of wigs in the Four Courts is that they make certain members of the Bar who unfortunately suffer from tonsorial deficiency look much younger.  Apart from that I cannot see an practical use that wigs might have.</P>
      <P>The effect of the proposal in the legislation is to prohibit the wearing of wigs and gowns while evidence is being given through television link by witnesses in relation to the type of offences covered by Part III.  Unless an intermediary is involved, as provided for in section 13, the witness will see on the monitor the lawyer conducting the examination and also the judge if the judge puts any questions. The Deputy's amendment, however, goes much further.  It would abolish wigs and gowns for all proceedings for any offence under Part III whether or not television link was employed or the witness was an adult.  I am aware from the debate on Second Stage that there is a significant measure of support in the House, and indeed outside it, for the abolition certainly of wigs and perhaps also of gowns in all proceedings and not specifically the cases mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission in its study into restrictive practices in the legal profession was of the view that barristers should no longer wear wigs.  A special committee of the Bar Council is reviewing the rules governing court dress having particular regard to the practices in other EC member states.  We are making a start here by doing away with the wearing of wigs and gowns in certain cases. On the wider front, my preference is to see the end, certainly, of wigs.  In relation to this legislation my preference would be to wait until that special committee of the Bar Council produce their recommendation, and I take this opportunity to say I hope they <Col N="499" /> will do so in the very near future.  In relation to the point made by my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, on the definition of wigs, I note the legislation does not contain a definition.  To prevent the horrendous possibilities envisaged by Deputy Fitzgerald, I will ask the parliamentary draftsman to have a look at that with a view to, in defining &ldquo;wig&rdquo;, confining it to meaning what we intend it to mean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his kindness in admitting a personal view and at the same time protecting the position he holds with regard to the official view.  I accept and respect the differences that can often exist.  Nevertheless I think the issue should be looked at more closely.</P>
      <P>I take the point that we must define the concept of a wig.  I do not know what formula could be devised to differentiate between a wig that is worn for natural reasons and one that is worn for judicial court proceedings.  Nevertheless it is a fair point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this part of the legislation is to create an environment in which people, who may otherwise be intimidated or inhibited by the court environment, will find it easy to give a full and frank explanation in relation to the circumstances on which they are in a position to give testimony.  That is the objective of this part of the legislation and it makes provision for the use of the latest technology of both video and television to attain it.  This is an historic innovation. Many of those who have practised in this area never envisaged, even a few years ago, a person giving testimony from a different room and location from the courtroom.  This is revolutionary.  As a result, quite correctly, this legislation has been recognised as a milestone in the history of the State in relation to legal reform, particularly in the area of criminal evidence.  We have not seen legislation which was as significant and as fundamental as this and this is not to overstate its importance, rather it reflects <Col N="500" /> it accurately.  This point has been taken up in many of the commentaries made by people outside the House since the Bill was published.</P>
    <P>In this context and against that background, the proposal that in the last decade of the 20th century people involved in these proceedings should wear normal working garb is modest in the extreme.  It is both sensible and desirable, having regard to the objective of the legislation which is to create an environment in which people will believe that they will be among their peers when giving their testimony.  Heretofore people have literally been frightened in the court environment by the presence of people who dress abnormally and act theatrically.  I have seen some of the finest advocates that this country ever produced perform in court to remarkable effect and extract a version of an account which suited their argument.  All this is very well but it has to be put beside the objective of this part of the legislation which is that we should work to create an environment in which young people can feel relaxed and be encouraged and invited to give a good account, as best they can without the need for theatrical behaviour and intimidation.</P>
    <P>Let me say not only as a practitioner but as someone who has given evidence on occasion in criminal trials, that it can be very daunting to walk into a court, given all its splendour.  It takes courage and experience to get over this in the first instance.  Many people give evidence in our courts on one occasion only and hope they never have to return.  By and large, they never do.  Therefore we have to take all these factors into account.  That is the reason the provision proposed by the Minister of State in the first instance, in relation to a television link, should be extended to include all proceedings in this area.  It is equally daunting for an adult as for a young person to cope with this experience.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State described it as a start.  It is a start but why stop there? Surely, it should be followed through.  If it is appropriate to provide a television <Col N="501" /> link it is equally appropriate to make changes in the live courts scene.  It is logical to do so.  The Minister of State has said the reason he has not gone the full distance, as suggested in amendment No. 60, is that a special committee of the Bar is dealing with this matter. It is the undoubted experience of this House, the Department and the Minister's constituency colleague, Deputy O'Malley, who got a clear message from the Irish Bar when, as Minister for Justice, he met them two decades ago that they are slow to change their rules; do so only rarely, for their reasons and not for ours.</P>
    <P>I spoke at length about the Bar during the course of the debate on the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill.  The public would be better served by one profession but, having said that, I should say that this is not another attack on my part on the Bar; I would like to see these changes made.</P>
    <P>In relation to the reforms introduced in the area of family law during the past two years we did not wait for the conclusions of any special committee. It may well be that the special committee were not sitting at that stage but that in itself is remarkable in that the Irish Bar could not find the time, or did not have the interest, to address the question of their garb and attire which is borrowed directly from the English judicial system.  I have made the point before that prior to the foundation of the State the lawyers from the Four Courts manned the people's courts as they were known &mdash; the republican courts &mdash; around the country and made judicial findings in cases which involved disputes over land and other issues and that in 1922, once the hostilities ceased, they went back to the Four Courts as quickly as they could in this new State where they wore the wigs and gowns which were worn by the previous Administration and operated a court system which mirrored the system operated by the colonial power that they had so honourably and wonderfully overthrown and expelled from this land.  It is incredible that ever since we have mimicked <Col N="502" /> the practices and rules of the English court system.</P>
    <P>That comment should not be taken as anti-British; in fact, the British are having great difficulty in coming in terms with their own archaic and anachronistic practices. Indeed, the Lord Chancellor was told off by the Bar when he proposed provisions similar to those we have already enshrined in our legislation.  As I said, in relation to reforms in the area of family law we did not delay as the matter was too important.  The Minister of the day recognised that it was a waste of time to enter negotiations and discussions or to cajole when one came to this conservative body of men and women.  Therefore we made provision for this change in the family law area.  As a result no wigs or gowns are worn by solicitors or barristers in proceedings in that area.</P>
    <P>Equally, if we want quickly to implement the provision proposed by the Minister of State, which is extended in my amendment, we should legislate for it, given that the people are not happy with the court system and, more importantly, to ensure that the purpose and intent of this legislation, which is that we work to create an environment in which the witness will find it easy to give testimony in the court, is achieved sooner rather than later.  Therefore I am pressing the Minister of State on this matter.  A more direct and active response is needed from him.</P>

      <P>In deference to those Deputies who would like to see as much progress as possible made on the amendments between now and 10.30 p.m., I would like to avail of this opportunity to support this worthwhile amendment.  I am surprised that the Minister of State has not been more forthcoming in support of the amendment.  I cannot understand why he has not accepted the amendment.  Neither can I understand the reason he can defend the archaic practice within our legal system of wearing wigs and gowns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the reasons for bringing this practice into our legal system but it certainly does not hold water as far as sound arguments are concerned. It ensures that a profession operating a closed shop will remain aloof and distinct from the very people it sets out to help and support through the legal process.</P>
      <P>A person came to me recently at a constituency clinic to express serious concern at his court settlement following a personal injury case, and he wanted to know what had happened.  When I went through the various stages with him he informed me that the settlement had been made by someone whose name he did not know.  He remembered that it was &ldquo;some guy with a wig&rdquo;.  This is what is happening in our legal system at present.  It is not good enough for the Minister to suggest that he is awaiting the outcome of a report from a special committee of the Bar Council.  Does the Minister seriously expect the Bar Council to put forward a proposal to do away with the process which helps them to become divorced from reality and the community, the insulation, by means of a wig and gown, which introduces, a form of intimidation into the Law Library and the High Court system?  It is most offputting for members of the community.  As was rightly stated, perhaps only once or twice in their life people experience at firsthand the process of the legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to the legislation with which we are dealing, with particular reference to Part III.  I agree with Deputy McCartan that it is time to change our legislation in regard to the justice system and to ensure that the ritual trappings of an ancient regime are not part and parcel of the administration of justice.  I hope that the Minister will be forthcoming in this regard and I warn him &mdash; perhaps he does not need to be warned &mdash; against waiting for a report from the Bar Council.  Perhaps he expects that the Bar Council will decide to divest themselves of wigs and gowns.  If that is <Col N="504" /> how they think, the process would have started already.  This applies particularly to young barristers who come up through the system and who look forward to the day when they can put on the wig which is whiter than the grey horse hair of their senior peers.  It is outrageous that, at the end of this century, people should be subjected to such a ritual within our legal system.  Wigs and gowns erect barriers between the legal profession and members of the public, just to preserve the club atmosphere within the Law Library of the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>A similar amendment was dealt with quite successfully in the Judicial (Separation and Family Law) Reform Act, 1989.  If I remember correctly, the then Minister for Justice felt that it was just a start and that further progress could be made.  This amendment is timely and the Minister should give serious consideration to accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy McCartan's amendment because wigs and gowns are an anachronism which, as he pointed out, go back to a time when this country was oppressed.  He got to the kernel of the issue when he said that the Minister was waiting for a sub-committee of the Bar Council to report to him.  In this House we do not represent the Bar Council, we represent the people.  We should take decisions based on the interests of people; wigs and gowns can be very intimidating to people, even in civil cases.  Deputy Flanagan mentioned a court settlement in a personal injuries claim.  Many people who come to the High Court in Dublin from the country see barristers in wigs and gowns, which is very offputting because they are concerned about the future and about the compensation they will get as a result of an accident.  Wigs and gowns should be taken out of our judicial system.  In highly sensitive cases, dealing with people who have been through a terrible trauma in many instances, we should project kindness, concern and sensitivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say he will wait for the report of the subcommittee of the Bar Council, <Col N="505" /> because they look after their own interests while we are here to look after the interests of the people.  There is a strong consensus in the House &mdash; and indeed the Minister is part of this consensus &mdash; that wigs and gowns should go. Why not do it now?  In terms of justice and its administration there is a feeling among many people that acquiring justice is intimidating.  If we eliminate wigs and gowns completely in cases which would arise under section 3 of this Bill, it would be a fine gesture which would make law &mdash; and justice under the law &mdash; more inviting.  I earnestly request the Minister to accept the amendment tabled by Deputy McCartan.</P>

      <P>I have been a Member of this House for five or six years.  If I were to take the first preference votes I got from barristers in the last general election off the 10,000 or so votes received, I would not have noticed the difference.  I would still have been elected on the same count.  I do not represent the Bar Council, I represent the people.  I have been doing so quite successfully in my own constituency for many years and I will continue to do so without any assistance from the Labour Party or anybody else.</P>
      <P>I want to put the amendment in context. Deputy Flanagan said that I was defending the restrictive practices of the Bar Council.  I do not know where he has been for the last couple of hours.  I did not hear myself defending the Bar Council; perhaps I did so unknowingly.  I will accept any valid arguments but please do not put words in my mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan rightly said that the idea of Part III of this legislation is to make the courts less intimidating and more encouraging in relation to witnesses. The idea behind Part III is to protect certain vulnerable witnesses. <Col N="506" /> That is why we are doing two things for particularly vulnerable witnesses in certain categories of cases.  We are allowing them &mdash; when the judge decrees it and, as I said, I hope that will be the norm &mdash; to give evidence through a television link outside the normal court-room atmosphere and people whom they see on the monitor will not be wearing these anachronistic wigs and gowns.  The absence of wigs and gowns is confined to those situations because Part III is designed to protect the small percentage of witnesses who are under 17 years of age in cases involving particular types of offences.</P>
    <P>I have put on record my views in relation to the wearing of wigs and gowns generally.  I should be happy to repeat them if anybody wished me to do so.  I am against them.  I am against them for all the reasons that have been stated and one or two others.  Deputy McCartan mentioned theatrical performances he had seen.  I have witnessed them over the years.  I must point out that whether or not lawyers were allowed to wear wigs and gowns those theatrical performances would continue; there are those who would be well capable of giving such theatrical performances and getting some very peculiar verdicts.  That happens in the American system, where wigs and gowns are not worn.</P>
    <P>I have explained that the legislation is cast as it is in relation to the non-wearing of wigs and gowns because Part III is designed to protect a particular category of witness in a certain situation.  I should like to put it to Deputy McCartan, not in an adversarial way but by way of debate, that I recognise one objection that would be raised to this amendment.  If the amendment were accepted then for a small percentage of criminal cases &mdash; taking into account the number of cases coming before our courts, covering both civil and criminal law cases &mdash; adult witnesses, those over 17 years of age, would not have to endure the trauma of being questioned or facing lawyers who are wearing wigs and gowns and a judge wearing a wig and gown.  Where would that leave the witnesses of the other 99 per cent or so of court cases?  Surely that <Col N="507" /> would be a position of reverse discrimination. As I said, the measure falls within Part III because Part III is designed to protect in every possible way a certain category of witness.  If we were to extend the non-wearing of wigs and gowns, surely it would be better to do that in all legal cases to be heard and not only in relation to a small percentage of criminal cases.  It would be preferable not to leave the rest of criminal and civil cases untouched.  Acceptance of the amendment would create a discriminatory situation for witnesses in those cases not covered under Part III.  I take on board the arguments made by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <P>One thing did occur to me during the debate.  I am a very trusting person and if the Bar Council tell me they are considering the issue seriously and will put forward serious proposals, I am inclined to take them at their word.  It has been pointed out to me, however, by others who are more suspicious than me that this may simply be a stalling device. Perhaps if we were to create a discriminatory situation against the vast majority of litigants the Bar Council might be encouraged to move more quickly.  The decision is not mine, as Deputies will understand, and at this stage all I can undertake to do is discuss the issue with the Minister for Justice, who will take the decision in this matter. I shall put to him the arguments that have been advanced tonight.  Deputy McCartan will be free to resubmit his amendment on Report Stage, when the matter has been considered.  Perhaps that is a useful suggestion.  The only guarantee I can give tonight is that I will discuss the matter with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has again been reasonable in his approach and I do not intend to haul him over the coals on this issue.  Equally, I do not wish to delay the House unduly on an issue that seems to have got many of us wound up and animated, that of the wearing of wigs and gowns.  The Minister of State should take some indicator of <Col N="508" /> the feeling that the House to some degree reflects a wider view on the issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to the Minister in two regards.  First, Part III deals with specific types of offences: sexual offences, offences involving violence or the threat of violence to a person and related offences to those offences.  Basically, we are dealing with sexual offences and or violence.  In relation to those cases the victim will by and large be someone who is vulnerable because a person will not be sexually abused or assaulted or attacked unless he or she is of a vulnerable disposition.  Those victims will be women; if not women, they will be young boys or young girls.  The Minister has to realise that the argument with regard to age is not really relevant.  By and large all witnesses involved in such proceedings will be timid, frightened, abused and very much broken even before they get to court.  It is my contention that a woman who has been abused is as much entitled to the considerations of this House as a young person who is perhaps equally intimidated in the environment in which the proceedings take place.  I do not feel that the argument of age holds much strength.  I realise that section 17 is designed to deal with those of 17 years and under but the considerations we need to have for that category as witnesses apply equally to the category of adult witness who will by and large be involved in such proceedings.  They will be women who have been badly intimidated, bruised and injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>But the witness and the victim do not have to be one and the same person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not. However, the primary witness in all of these cases, before any ingredient can be laid, is the victim.  The recent case in Waterford comes to mind as a good example.  The primary witness must go into the witness box before any case is established and before one could even talk about witnesses.  I accept the Minister's point, but I consider that the argument exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> Secondly, in relation to the point made about the number of cases involved comprising a very small percentage of the total, I draw attention to the fact that we are not dictating to the Bar in all cases. The Minister has made my argument for me; I had intended to come back to this aspect.  In the environment of the vulnerable witness to which I have referred my amendment would create a rule that would force the Bar to come to their senses more generally.  Surely those involved would recognise that the Legislature had told them that in a certain segment of criminal cases they should not go to court dressed in the old attire and that, rather than have barristers look up their briefs to determine whether a wig and gown case was involved, it would be sensible to follow the principle through. The reason the principle has not been followed through in relation to previous legislation is that provision was also made for separate courts.  In Dublin at least the family law courts sit in a separate building away from other court dealings.  A separate legal practice has developed there. The Minister will be aware that in the provincial courts separate days are reserved for dealing with family law cases and practitioners go to a different assembly.  If it came to wigs and gowns having to be taken off and put on again, I am of the view that the profession would decide to be sensible in the matter.  I accept that to some degree I am only dealing with a small percentage of cases but my amendment would be the push necessary to achieve the ultimate objective, which certainly seems to be desired by Members.  I respect the Minister's personal position.  He was prepared to express it which is not often a position that emanates from that office.  A Minister can very rarely speak his or her own mind, particularly when trying to champion a Bill.  The discussion on the amendment has been useful, and because I consider progress will be made on the issue on Report Stage, I shall withdraw my amendment for the time being.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 31, after &ldquo;conducted.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;&lsquo;Conduct&rsquo; in this context shall not entitle the intermediary to interject and/or <Col N="511" /> convey the replies of the witness to or for the judge and the jury in any circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to endeavour to address somewhat further the functions of the intermediary in the proceedings. I spoke with some degree of hyperbole earlier about the remarkable, revolutionary concepts being introduced into our evidentiary laws and the significance of this Bill in relation thereto. Certainly one of the more revolutionary and unusual aspects of this Bill is the concept of the introduction of an intermediary, if you like, someone who will act as conveyor and interpreter of a question to a young witness and who may or may not have some function in dealing with the response of the witness. These matters need to be teased out somewhat further so that those who implement the provisions of this Bill will understand exactly what are the functions, responsibilities and indeed parameters within which an intermediary can operate.  I have said that the provisions of this Bill are revolutionary. They are not entirely so because, heretofore, when deaf and mute witnesses gave testimony, people representing the National Association of the Deaf and other agencies would come to court and translate the words for the examiner by way of sign language, sound or touch, by applying the hand of the person to the voice box or throat of the intermediary speaking, or, as has been the case, an interpreter may translate the language of the court into the language of a foreigner brought before our courts.  Therefore, the concept of an intermediary is not new but is certainly new in these circumstances, in that it recognises not so much a physical deformity or an infirmity as affecting language, but rather inability of a witness due to youthfulness or other difficulties.  Specifically the provisions of this Bill endeavour to deal with witnesses in, say, an incest case who inevitably will have difficulty <Col N="512" /> in using language necessary to convey to the court exactly what is intended.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the concept of the intermediary in section 13 is that someone will be involved in a very active way in the conduct of the proceedings.  We should remember that, unfortunately, to some extent we are still dealing with adversarial-type proceedings, when points can be won or lost depending on how quickly and with what impact a question is delivered and/or how quickly and with what conviction an answer is returned.  Therefore, the concept of an intermediary must be examined to ensure that he does not become an undue buffer or cushion against the line or directness of the questioning of the examiner.  Conversely, if an intermediary is deemed to be someone who conveys the language or words of a witness to the examiner, the judge or jury, it is important that the intermediary is not given any opportunity to reinterpret, soften or redirect the purport of that response.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I pointed out to the Minister a difference of wording between the explanatory memorandum which, at paragraph 24, dealing with section 13 says that an intermediary would be appointed to convey questions to a witness under age 17 if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so.  The explanatory memorandum is very specific in stipulating that the function of an intermediary is merely to convey the question and ensure that the witness understands what he or she is being asked.  In my view the Bill is somewhat wider in that it says that &ldquo;examination-in-chief, cross-examination or re-examination, or any part thereof, be conducted through an intermediary&rdquo;. That different wording leaves open the possibility that conducting means conducting the questioning to and from the witness.  In other words, there is the possibility that an intermediary would have the function of conveying back the answer.  That needs to be clarified.  That is why I have suggested a definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; in my amendment which reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> In page 10, subsection (1), line 31, after &ldquo;conducted.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;&lsquo;Conduct&rsquo; in this context shall not entitle the intermediary to interject and/or convey the replies of the witness to or for the judge and the jury in any circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore I am making it absolutely mandatory that the concept of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; included in section 13 be defined to state the explicit meaning contained in the explanatory memorandum, namely, that the function of the intermediary is solely to ensure that the question posed by the examiner is understood by the witness and, thereafter, it is a matter for the witness to reply.  On balance, that is as much as we can hope to achieve by the deployment of such a person within the courts system.  Otherwise we would be entering into the difficulties of saying that the testimony ultimately heard by the judge or jury might not be the testimony of the witness himself or herself. For that reason it is important to clarify this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has tabled a further amendment as an alternative.  I have no difficulty with his amendment in so far as it argues that an intermediary shall not deviate from the phraseology of the question asked nor interpose any comment on such question nor on the reply given. I think Deputy Shatter supposes that an intermediary will have no function in picking up the reply and if you like, translating or conveying it back to the judge or jury, but I do not think that is absolutely clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention in amendments Nos. 35 and 36 would be somewhat similar, that is to remove some of the uncertainty about the use of an intermediary <i>per se</i> which concerns people. For example, people are concerned about the definition of the function of the intermediary or what they would be involved in.  For example, the use of the words &ldquo;examination-in-chief, cross-examination or re-examination, or any part thereof, be conducted through an intermediary&rdquo; would suggest that the questioning would be put to the person <Col N="514" /> giving evidence through the intermediary, not directly, and that equally the reply would be conveyed through the intermediary.  I accept that it will be left to the discretion of the court to decide whether an intermediary is required.  If there is some difficulty the court may decide not to use an intermediary. However, an intermediary may have to be used in certain cases in the interests of justice.</P>
      <P>It is not at all clear how an intermediary should operate and in what circumstances a court may decide whether or not to use an intermediary.  This is why Deputy Shatter put down amendment No. 36 which proposes that &ldquo;an intermediary shall ask the witness any question asked by the judge, barrister or solicitor concerned in the examination of the witness and shall not deviate from the phraseology of the question asked nor interpose any comment on such question nor on the reply given&rdquo;.  Deputy McCartan proposes that an intermediary shall not be entitled to &ldquo;interject and/or convey the replies of the witness to or from the judge and the jury in any circumstances&rdquo;.  There is a desire to tighten up the section so that people will know what is expected of them and courts will interpret the provisions in the same way; in other words, ensure that there is some sort of unanimity in the application of the provisions of section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that some of the purists in the law area are concerned about the use of an intermediary.  They think that such a system is unworkable and that an intermediary could influence the decision made in a case which would not otherwise be reached if there was no intermediary. I sympathise with those people: purists have to exist and they must try to maintain the very clinical nature of the giving and taking of evidence.  They believe that the clinical nature of the giving and taking of evidence will be breached if an intermediary is used and that the accused might be put at a disadvantage.  Many people have expressed their concern to me about the use of an intermediary.  It is very important that we examine in great detail how this system will work.  I am <Col N="515" /> not at all clear as to how an intermediary will carry out his functions.</P>
    <P>When I looked at the section first I thought an intermediary was a nanny who would put a child at ease and adopt a playful manner.  I was rather concerned that this would be the case.  I am not sure that an intermediary could act in such a fashion as this is a very serious matter and the interests of the accused have to be protected also.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on how he visualises this system operating and the type of person an intermediary has to be. Will he have to be good with children and able to put them at ease?  Will he have to be highly qualified in court procedures and in the proper giving and taking of evidence?  We expressed concern about this point on Second Stage.  We got no clear indication at any time during the debate that people fully understood or appreciated the provision in this section and how the system would work.  I look forward with interest to hearing the Minister's comments on amendments No. 35 and 36.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as concerned as anyone in this House to ensure that this very unusual form of examination of witnesses by an intermediary does not give rise to any injustice or is not interpreted in any way other than the way in which we intend it to be interpreted.  Deputy McCartan seeks to ensure that an intermediary will not interject and or convey the replies of the witness to those in the courtroom.  I agree with him that that would be objectionable but such conduct is not permitted by this section as it stands.  The section provides for the examination by counsel or by the accused if he is not legally represented, to be conducted through an intermediary.  The word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; can only refer to the actual questioning of the witness. I do not think that terminology, even if read in conjunction with the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo;, would envisage the intermediary conveying the witness's replies to those in the courtroom.  Even if Deputies do <Col N="516" /> not accept that, there is a second point I can make in this respect.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed arrangements, in cases where an intermediary is used the witness will not see or hear the questioner. The questions will be relayed to the witness by the intermediary who will be in audio contact with the questioner. The questioner and the other persons present in the courtroom will hear the questions as they are being put to the witness and also the replies of the witness. At all times those in the courtroom will be able to see and hear the witness and hear the intermediary.  Moreover, the judge will have a separate monitor covering the witness room.  In other words, it is the intention of the legislation that the intermediary will be merely a conduit to convey to the witness the questions asked by counsel or the accused if he is not legally represented.  Everything said in the witness room by the witness and the intermediary will be heard in the courtroom.  Therefore, there would be no point in the intermediary repeating the witness's replies; the replies will be heard clearly in the courtroom.  No doubt Deputy McCartan will want to comment on that point.  If he has any difficulty with it, I have no objection to looking at it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment causes me much more difficulty because it seeks to go much further in that it would also forbid the intermediary from deviating from the phraseology of the question asked.  I do not think this would be acceptable because it would be contrary to the whole purpose of having an intermediary. One of the main purposes of having an intermediary is to maintain ease of communication with the witness and, where appropriate, to render the question in a form in which it will be intelligible to the witness at his or her stage of development.  An example quoted to me is that counsel might first ask the child his or her name and address. A very young child may think that the word &ldquo;address&rdquo; has something to do with a dress.  Under the section as it stands, the intermediary could rephrase the question and ask the child where he or she lived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that a counsel experienced in <Col N="517" /> these matters would probably frame all questions in a form which could be relayed without any need for change, but that will not always apply.  If the intermediary has not paraphrased a question sufficiently accurately that can be explained privately by counsel to the intermediary over the audio link and a revised question substituted.  Counsel will at all times be in control of the questioning and the judge is there to see that the proper standards of fairness are maintained.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McCartan's amendment, it is a matter of interpreting the English language.  I do not think the phraseology used in the section contemplates or can be interpreted to mean that the intermediary can start interjecting, interposing and replying on behalf of the witness.  Even if he did this, there would not be any point in it because the judge, jury and counsel can see the proceedings on screen.  With regard to Deputy Shatter's amendment, I cannot accept the proposal that the intermediary should be prevented from rephrasing a question.  As I said, one of the main purposes of the legislation is that the intermediary maintains ease of communication with the child witness. This would involve explaining the question asked by counsel.  As I said earlier, the entire proceedings will be clearly visable to all the people concerned.</P>

      <P>That is the point I am making; the explanatory memorandum is more precise in its language.  The intermediary is there to convey questions to a witness.  It could not be clearer than that. The Minister suggests that the concept of an examination is the asking of the question only.  If he asks the thousands <Col N="518" /> of young people who will be sitting the leaving certificate examination what they understand by the concept of an examination, they will tell him that a big part is the question but equally important is the answer.  That may seem a facetious and frivolous illustration of my point. However, the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; encompasses not only the question but also the answer.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the use of the word &ldquo;examination&rdquo; in the Bill conveys only one concept, that is the question in cross-examination or re-examination. I humbly suggest that that is equally capable of being interpreted as including the answers to be sought.  That is why I say that the wording is imprecise and unclear and should be clarified in terms of the simple exposition given in the explanatory memorandum.  I agree with the Minister that the function of the intermediary should be to convey the question, but I suggest that the phraseology allows also for the intermediary to convey back the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my amendment I propose ruling out the concept of interjecting.  It is inevitable in this scenario that witnesses will not necessarily be reluctant but hesitant because they are in a separate room, away from the court and because of their age and the type of offence involved.  I agree with the Minister in his response to Deputy Shatter's amendment in that the intermediary is there to translate the formal courtroom language into language that is intelligible to the person who is being questioned.  It is a helping process to coax the answer by using professional techniques as referred to under subsection (2).  In practice the case may arise where the witness is on the point of giving an answer but if he has difficulty expressing himself there may be a tendency for the intermediary to draw the answer from him.  That is why I suggest that interjection be avoided.  It is important to lay down clearly that while the intermediary, using professional etiquette and technique, is there to assist and in some respects cajole a witness to give an answer he or she might not otherwise be able to give, no prompting or assisting the <Col N="519" /> witness should allowed once the question has been conveyed to him or her.</P>
    <P>We recognise that we are dealing with traumatic offences, such as sexual assault, and the witnesses will be vulnerable, reluctant and hesitant.  We are providing that their environment be witness-friendly, out of the courtroom, and that technology by way of a television link be used to convey their testimony into the courtroom.  The whole idea is to assist the witness when he or she is giving his or her testimony.  We are now introducing an intermediary who will convey questions in an understandable way because we recognise that formal court language and forensic questioning often confuse, confound and intimidate the witness.</P>
    <P>An intermediary may well be a person who may not have had direct involvement with a particular witness but may have had experience of people in this kind of situation and knows that he will have to cajole and coax in order to build up the confidence of the witness.  Inevitably &mdash; I have seen this in practice &mdash; when people in the witness box are trying to relate a traumatic experience they find it almost impossible to put words on what they want to say.  It is at that crucial point that a woman will break down in tears and say that she needs time to compose herself.  For the first time since the event the person is being asked to tell in public the horrendous things that happened to him or her, whether it be abuse, assault or whatever.</P>
    <P>Because of the way this section is drafted, a judge would not be blamed for construing it in the context of assisting, cajoling and assuring the witness.  What is wrong with the suggestion of allowing the intermediary to not only convey the question to the witness but also to help the witness in delivering the response?  A court may feel that that is not entirely unreasonable given the way in which the section is so broadly drafted.  I have difficulty with the section but I may be wrong, as I often am.  I am suggesting, for the sake of clarity, that we proceed with <Col N="520" /> the language used in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>I tabled the amendment to ensure, first, that the intermediary process is a one way process and, second, that the intermediary is not allowed to interject.  I am not concerned that the intermediary would try to prevent the barrister barracking the witness or prevent the witness from answering if he realises that he or she is going to give an answer that is not in the full interests of the prosecution.  I want to ensure that interjections of the cajoling kind which may be of direct assistance to the witness after the question has been conveyed are prevented.  I think the House is agreed that once the question has been conveyed the witness should deliver the answer by his or her own resources.</P>

      <P>We still have not come to grips with the meaning of &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo;. Deputy McCartan has given a few different interpretations.  The Minister has not convinced me that he knows what this is all about.  I have not convinced myself that I know what it is all about.  This procedure has been put in place to protect people who are immature and who may be emotionally disturbed as a result of certain acts perpetrated on them.  We will put a person in a separate room where he will not see the accused, for example, in order to put him at ease, and an intermediary is to be there, but we still have not clarified what that intermediary will do.  Is it a nanny type person who will succeed in putting the person at ease?  We have not focused on the fact that a person knows he is on closed circuit television.  When the television cameras first came into this House many people became very uptight because they knew they were on camera. They tended to act differently because they knew people could see them.  A child with the use of reason knows what a television is like and will know that people can see what is on it and will feel under pressure.  I can see the need for an intermediary provided we can define what that intermediary will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> The only good thing about section 13 is the discretion given to the court to decide whether it will use this intermediary. That discretion is necessary given that we are so incoherent about what the intermediary is supposed to do. I cannot see the court allowing the sort of thing that Deputy McCartan suggested might evolve.  I cannot see the defence being happy with a sort of cajoling nanny being allowed to drag various feelings into phrases from the person who is giving evidence.  I do not see any great difficulty with Deputy Shatter's amendment. We are talking here about intelligent people who are working every day with language and most of them have children or had children who are now grown up.  I cannot see any great difficulty with the questioning.  If one asks a person about an address and she starts talking about a frock, one can rephrase the question. Why should the intermediary be the one to decide what the judge means or what the prosecution means when they are asking questions?  In this the Minister is allowing the intermediary to make decisions as to what language means. That would not be acceptable to the person who asked the question.  The Minister said that the intermediary would be in a position in which he could change the words that were used to convey the meaning.  That means that the intermediary would make a judgment as to what is really meant.  None of us is happy with the lack of clarity here.  We can talk about this until the cows come home and we will still have a difficulty.  The clinical nature of this whole business is definitely in danger of breaking down if we cannot come out of this room with a fairly clear picture of what we envisage happening under these circumstances.</P>
    <P>If section 13 is open to all sorts of interpretations, then all sorts of things will happen under it.  I am not at all happy that we know what will happen as a result of section 13.  I would like to hear the Minister again in the light of what I have said about the intermediary being put in a judgmental role.  If this is allowed, what limits are set to it?  The example the Minister gave is quite trivial.  The Minister <Col N="522" /> referred to the use of the word &ldquo;address&rdquo; and its interpretation as &ldquo;a dress&rdquo;.  A person of any age could decide that a person was talking about a dress rather than where one lived, but if we allow the intermediary to take on that kind of role, where does it end?  Can we allow the intermediary to cajole, to joke with and play with the person giving evidence in order to elicit a response?  Is that fair to the accused?  Somebody who is very skilled could elicit a particular kind of response.  I am worried that unless we get an understanding of what will happen, this section will be inoperable.  I am not happy that we should leave section 13 yet.  We should spend quite some time talking about it before we leave it.</P>

      <P>I have some difficulty with the selection of the word &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; because I am not sure that it conveys what the Minister intends.  The concise Oxford dictionary says that an intermediary is an immediate person or thing, a mediator.  I am sure the Minister does not intend that the intermediary would be a mediator in any sense.  Between whom would he be mediating?  Roget's Thesaurus comes up with some rather more bizarre descriptions, one like, medium or middle man, deputy, retailer, broker, go-between and so on.  I am not frivolous here.  The idea behind the mediator is to make it easier for the witness who has been exposed to trauma and, indeed, to some horrible actions, to give precise and concise information and evidence.  The section states that an intermediary referred to in subsection (1) shall be appointed by the court and shall be a <Col N="523" /> person who in its opinion is competent to act as such.</P>
      <P>As a teacher, with experience in the language level of children and how they can understand questions and how they should be put, I firmly believe that we need to give a great deal of thought to the qualifications of such a person.  As subsection (2) was constructed, it could lead to what I might term &ldquo;ad hockery&rdquo;, and to inconsistency.  In many ways it may not contribute to what the Minister seeks to achieve.  The word needs to be looked at in terms of its dictionary definition. I have not a more precise term to convey what the Minister means or to define what the Labour Party believe to be a very important concept.  The section is much too woolly and needs to be tightened.  A clear definition of the competence, qualifications and experience of the person involved should be provided in the section.</P>

      <P>The section is unsatisfactory. Either amendment would go some way towards tightening it up and eliminating the problem.  The provision that the intermediary shall not deviate from the phraseology of the question is very important.  I can foresee difficulties if the intermediary is allowed to vary the question.  A person on conviction could have good grounds for appeal in such circumstances.  Many difficulties could ensue.  Cases are sometimes dismissed for very simple reasons.  An example is a case where a juror spoke to an accused in a very brief aside.  The accused was convicted of murder but later a retrial was ordered on that point.  Where a specific question is asked by a prosecuting barrister and that question is then changed, there is a change of emphasis in what is occurring.  There is a groundswell of support for the section but with the qualifications and amendments as suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will confirm whether the witness will be able to see exactly what is taking place in the courtroom. Will he hear only the intermediary asking the question?  The judge, barristers and solicitors in the courtroom will <Col N="524" /> see the witness and what is taking place in the courtroom.  The intermediary will be in the courtroom, subject to the control of the judge.  Who will be with the witness?  If the witness is on his own he will not know exactly what is going on. He could feel very remote and isolated, in a very lonely position.  This could cause considerable problems.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on how he sees procedures developing.</P>

When there was difficulties in labour relations, one can ask for the assistance of a particular rights commissioner in whom people have confidence.  Is this the type of individual who might perform this task, with the confidence of all involved in the case?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cotter said he is not convinced that I know what I am talking about.  He has certainly convinced me that he does not.  I am sorry to be uncharitable but that is my firm conviction. The intermediary has to be appointed by the court.  Section 13 (2) states that the intermediary shall be appointed by the court and shall be a person who, in its opinion, is competent to act as such.  That relates to Deputy Cotter's inquiry as to whether the intermediary would be somebody who would cajole, play with, encourage and winkle information from the child witness.  The barrister will be asking the questions and the intermediary will be the conduit through whom the questions will be put. In some cases the questions will be rephrased by the intermediary to make them clearer to the witness.  The barrister will be conducting the questioning.  The intermediary will be linked by audio link <Col N="525" /> to the barrister and he will put the questions to the child witness.</P>
      <P>Deputy O`Shea quoted some dictionary definitions which I found quite amusing.  I do not belittle the Deputy's point but we cannot go down the road of looking up dictionary definitions in relation to every section in legislation. Deputy Enright mentioned the question of a retrial if the phraseology is changed in some way.  I do not exactly understand the point.  If somebody who is guilty is convicted because the intermediary happens to phrase the prosecution's questions better than the prosecuting counsel, I will not object.</P>

      <P>The intermediary is a mere conduit through whom the examination will be conducted.  Deputy Enright asked how the procedure will operate in practice and where the intermediary will be. He also asked what the witness will see. That is a valid point.</P>
      <P>The intermediary will be sitting beside the witness in the separate room and the judge, counsel etc.  will not be visible to the witness.  There are very good reasons for that.  The whole idea of the intermediary system is to separate the child witness from the accused so that not only does the child not have to go through the trauma of actual cross-examination but he does not have to see the person he is accusing of this particularly horrific offence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh raised a valid point regarding qualifications on which a subsequent amendment has been tabled.  I should like to read a statement from the departmental note into the record which deals with the point made by the Deputy. The Law Reform Commission expressed the view that intermediaries should be experienced in interviewing children and specially trained in child language, psychology and the relevant law with particular emphasis on the law of evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Child language.  That would be the ideal situation but I think the Bill is not the place to specify particular qualifications, training or experience. We will come to that later because an amendment has been tabled to that effect.</P>
      <P>Section 13 leaves it to the court to appoint a person who, in its opinion, is competent to act as an intermediary.  The Department of Justice, in conjunction with the prosecution agencies, will give every assistance to the court in this respect.  Probably the most important qualification is the possession of a friendly personality and an ability to get along with children and win their confidence and trust.  Experience of dealing with children and a qualification in child psychology would, of course, be a help though it is not essential.  Also the intermediary would need to be familiar with basic court procedure.  The intermediary, in common with others involved in the trial, the judge, counsel etc.  would have to become familiar with the operation of the technical facilities, that is <i>sine qua non.</i></P>
      <P>Any difficulties about the position of an intermediary should not be exaggerated. As stated, he or she will act simply as a conduit just as an interpreter does, and nobody has raised any difficulties about interpreters interpreting questions and putting them to witnesses. That happens all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the Deputy's point.  I had not forgotten it.  Of course, it will interrupt the flow of the cross examiner's questions but that is not a serious objection.  It will be of considerable assistance where the child is at such a stage of development that apparently simple questions might be confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh asked whether a panel of intermediaries would be appointed.  As the appointment of intermediaries is in the hands of a trial judge, it is not possible to say at present what <Col N="527" /> procedures will be adopted &mdash; we are only at the infancy stage, no pun intended. However, it does seem likely, and it is my wish, that a panel of suitable persons will be compiled.  Certainly, and I can give this assurance to the House, the Department will give whatever help is necessary in this respect.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question about phraseology, if I were to accept Deputy Shatter's amendment I might as well withdraw the section dealing with intermediaries in its entirety despite the support it has got.  The intermediary must be in a position to relate to the child and if that means changing the phraseology 'of the technical questioning, so be it. Deputy Cotter asked whether the intermediary can set himself up in a judgmental fashion and conduct the examination himself regardless of what counsel asks him.  That is an absolutely ludicrous situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is on record and I will quote it back to him.  The fact is that the barrister, or the solicitor as the case may be, is the person who puts the questions.  He asks the intermediary to ask the witness such-and-such a question. If the intermediary asks something else the barrister can say to him and everybody in the court can hear it &mdash;&ldquo;that is not what I asked you to ask, I asked you to ask him this&rdquo;.  That is the reality of the situation and that is how the system will work.  I could not even undertake to consider Deputy Shatter's amendment.  I do not want to divide the House but I would be misleading Deputies if I said I was prepared to consider Deputy Shatter's amendment.  However, I take on board the point made by Deputy McCartan.  I still hold to my view that examination in the educational context is not the same as examination in the court context. Nevertheless, I have been reading the explanatory memorandum and I take the Deputy's point that the phraseology in the explanatory memorandum, or something approximating to it, probably conveys <Col N="528" /> more clearly the Minister's intention and that of the draftsman.  I will undertake to examine that point.  That is a fair point in view of the fact that there is such a fundamental change in the law of evidence, albeit in a small number of cases, but it is better that we get it right on this occasion.  I cannot accept amendment No. 36 in the name of Deputy Shatter because it would involve changing the whole nature of the intermediary system and destroying the effectiveness of the intermediary.</P>

      <P>The Minister has usefully responded to the debate at least on amendment No. 35.  I am inclined to agree with his view regarding the first part of Deputy Shatter's amendment.  If he were to accept that, it would make a nonsense of the concept of an intermediary. I welcome the suggestion that we will look again at this issue on Report Stage.  In commenting on section 13 the law society state that the committee are not convinced of the need for an intermediary &mdash; I disagree with the society on that, in fact I disagree with most of what is contained in their submission.  Welcome though it is that they did respond, they seem to have thrown out every new concept proposed in the Bill for all the old traditional reasons.  They go on to say: &ldquo;nor is it clear what functions such a person should perform&rdquo;.  To that extent I think they are right.  To the extent that it is an entirely new concept in the area we are dealing with, there is a need for guidelines to be drawn up by the Department for the assistance of judges who ultimately will be conducting this.  It would be a necessary aid because there is so much new work to be done, new technologies to be employed and new procedures to be got around.  The submission goes on to state: &ldquo;if the witness is not capable of giving evidence, except through an intermediary, this may simply suggest that such evidence is not sufficiently coherent or reliable to found a conviction&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the society said earlier they are not clear about what functions the intermediary should perform, in their later <Col N="529" /> language they interpret it to mean, potentially, that the witness will be giving evidence through the intermediary.  That is symptomatic of the troubles of interpretation that will arise.  The society are taking the view that it is conceived, under the section as they read it, that the witness will be giving the evidence through the intermediary.  It illustrates the point I am making, that there is much unclear thinking in regard to this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This debate has been very useful.  I hope nothing any of us have said in regard to this section and these amendments takes away from our support for the concept, because the idea of an intermediary is important.  In terms of help and assistance one of the universal features you will also experience in these courts is that a witness, particularly a young witness, whispers.  Often they are shy, they are not sure or they do not want to tell the world and they whisper their answers.  Unless we tell intermediaries that they cannot interject to amplify a reply by repeating it, on behalf of the witness, there will be difficulties.  We must be precise.  If the wording of the explanatory memorandum is imported into the Bill I shall be happy to withdraw any suggested amendment in this area.</P>

      <P>On 6 February 1992, in the Dublin District Court, Judge Fitzpatrick convicted and sentenced a youth to four months in St. Laurence's detention centre in Finglas.  The charge was a serious one in that it involved a stolen motor vehicle.  The youth was convicted of allowing himself to be carried in this stolen vehicle.</P>
      <P>When the warrant was issued by the District Justice, the Garda enforced it and they brought the youth as directed to St. Laurence's detention centre in Finglas. The youth, however, was refused admission to St. Laurence's apparently because of a lack of accommodation and he was immediately released back onto the streets of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter must be considered as an example of very serious neglect of duty by the Government.  It is a typical example of the revolving door system that operates in Mountjoy and in many of our prisons and detention centres in this country.  It is to a large extent responsible for the increase in the level of serious crime that has occurred in recent years.  The failure to detain this youth also displays a flagrant disregard by the <Col N="531" /> Minister and his Department of a sentence imposed by our courts.</P>
    <P>It has further come to my attention that the youth in question is at present on remand in custody, charged with the murder of an 18-year old Air Corps apprentice, Keith Wall, on 17 March last at Balfe Road, Walkinstown.  I am not aware of any of the other facts relating to this murder charge and I do not intend discussing or dwelling on any aspect whatsoever of this particular case as it is <i>sub judice</i>.  What is relevant, however, is the fact that this alleged offence of murder, with which this youth is charged, occurred during a period of time when he should have been serving his sentence in St. Laurence's detention centre in Finglas.</P>
    <P>If in fact the order of 6 February 1992, had been enforced then the youth would have been lawfully detained in St. Laurence's detention centre.  The Minister for Justice has a clear duty to explain to the House why the court order of 6 February 1992 was not enforced.  In the event of a satisfactory explanation not being forthcoming the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, should apologise publicly for his failure to implement the order of the District Court and assure this House and the citizens of this country that such a situation will not arise in the future.</P>
    <P>To compound the seriousness of this situation, last Thursday 21 May, Judge James McDonnell sentenced the same youth to two years detention in Trinity House, Lusk, on serious burglary charges.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána enforced the warrant of the District Court and brought the convicted person to Trinity House, Lusk.  The youth was refused admission to Trinity House, as the detention centre was full.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant increase in the level of indictable offences in the last three to five years.  However, the increase last year was the greatest single increase, by almost 8 per cent in the last ten years.  The increase is alarming and the responsibility for this increase rests <Col N="532" /> with the Government.  One of the main reasons for such an increase is that persons convicted of serious crimes are brought to prison and in many cases are refused admission and allowed back out onto the streets.</P>
    <P>No real attention is being paid to the victims of crime.  A young girl must be protected and feel safe to go to a disco, a dance, or to walk the streets.  Elderly people should not be afraid of being attacked in their homes at night as they are at present.  There is a duty on the Government to protect our citizens which they are not doing.  They are failing in their duty.  The revolving door system that is being enforced at present must end immediately and the Minister must ensure that there will be no recurrence of people being refused admission to prisons after being convicted by our courts of committing serious crimes.</P>

      <P>The case to which the Deputy refers is a tragic one for all concerned.  I am sure Members of this House have no desire to add to the anguish that has already been caused to so many people.  At the same time, however, it is important that any misunderstandings regarding the involvement of custodial facilities operated by my Department in this unfortunate case should be clarified and I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettably the case that the youth in question had been involved in a number of breaches of the law prior to the incident which has resulted in the situation that he is now awaiting trial on a murder charge.  The youth in question was committed by the courts, on 6 February 1992, to four months in St.  Laurence's Industrial School arising from a charge of larceny.  However, under the terms of the Children Act, 1908, as amended, which governs the operation of industrial schools, such schools are limited to the admission of boys who are under 15 years of age on the date of <Col N="533" /> admission.  The youth in question was over 15 years of age at the time of referral and, as such, was not eligible for admission to St. Laurence's Industrial School under the terms of the 1908 Children Act. I am not aware of any effort having been made to secure an alternative placement at that time.</P>
    <P>More recently, on 18 March 1992, the youth in question was remanded by the courts to Trinity House in respect of assault charges.  He was subsequently re-remanded on several occasions up to 14 April 1992.  On reappearing in court on that date he was charged with murder and was further remanded to Trinity House.  On 13 May 1992, he was remanded to Trinity House until his trial date on the murder charge.  The authorities in Trinity House await notification of the trial date.</P>
    <P>Most recently, on 21 May 1992, the youth appeared before the Children Court charged with trespass with intent to steal and was committed to two years detention at Trinity House on that charge.  The authorities in Trinity House were unable to facilitate the court on the specific long term committal because of the non-availability of long term committal beds at that time.  However, in ongoing exercise of the remand order of 13 May 1992, the youth was nonetheless accommodated in a remand place in Trinity House and will remain there on remand until his trial date.  In the meantime arrangements will be made to ensure that a long stay committal place will be available at Trinity House should the courts so require following the hearing of the murder charge.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that in so far as it has been possible to do so, the custodial facilities operated by my Department have facilitated the courts in regard to this case.  At the same time, however, one would have to be concerned at situations where inappropriate referrals can result in undesirable releases from custody.  The resolution of such problems lies in closer liaison between the courts and the custodial facilities and my Department will <Col N="534" /> shortly be raising this and other relevant issues with the Department of Justice to seek a more satisfactory arrangement for the future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the steps the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications proposes to take to secure a settlement of the dispute in An Post arising from their meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for affording me the opportunity of raising this important national issue.  The Labour Party believe that the current dispute in An Post is similar in its nature and underlying cause to the recent RTE dispute.  It is due to a complete breakdown of trust by the workforce in the motives and means that senior management are prepared to use to implement change.  They also believe there is another hidden agenda.</P>
      <P>The current industrial dispute in An Post, now in its fifth week, is having a devastating effect on the economic and social life of our economy.  Throughout the length and breadth of the country small firms are being put at risk, orders are being lost and employees laid off. Some of these enterprises will never recover.  Indeed, An Post may never recover if the dispute is allowed to continue and escalate.  Each day the dispute continues many of these firms and An Post are a day closer to bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to take issue with the machotactics being used by the management of An Post in this dispute.  At present 1,300 postal workers who are working normally are not being paid.  This is a deliberate tactic with the sole intention to escalate the dispute.  At an early stage wage clerks were suspended and this was used as an excuse not to pay other employees who were working.  Let me give a further <Col N="535" /> example, in my constituency in County Dublin some 200 postal workers who are not affected in any way by the dispute and paid through another section by another mechanism have been left without their salaries.  This was a deliberate decision by senior management.  Does the Minister condone this?</P>
    <P>Yesterday outside this House I met the spouses of postal workers who outlined to me a sorry tale of hardship which is being experienced by many of them and their children.  Indeed, many of their children were with them.  They are not entitled to social welfare payments and many of them cannot afford medical expenses or to meet their mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>What kind of industrial relations policy is this?  As far as I am concerned, it is a relic of another age and is alien to this country.  I condemn the one-sided approach taken by the Government, in particular by the Minister, throughout this dispute which has not been helpful. This has been acknowledged by all concerned but in particular by the workers. In addition to siding with the management, the Minister stated in this House to me and other Deputies that this dispute was mainly about overtime.  This is not the case as clearly illustrated by the unions in their submission dated 13 May last in which they stated: &ldquo;the phased reduction of overtime earnings recommended by the Tribunal will be implemented on an individual basis&rdquo;.  If as the Minister stated, the question of overtime is the main issue surely the company should test the union's stated offer to eliminate overtime to the limit in negotiations.</P>
    <P>The CWU also stated in their submission of 13 May that the relocation of Dublin delivery district offices 1 and 2 to two new premises will proceed on the basis recommended by the tribunal.  Furthermore, they stated that the proposals for closure of the productivity agreements recommended by the tribunal will also go ahead.  From my reading of the submission the outstanding matters relate to the 450 vacancies within the <Col N="536" /> company and whether they should be casual or permanent positions.  With over 280,000 people out of work at present a sound case could be made for making some or all of these permanent.</P>
    <P>Given the significance of this issue, the Government must intervene.  At this stage I ask the Taoiseach, the Minister, and the management of An Post to be more flexible.  From my own contacts with the union I believe that they will be sufficiently flexible should the company show a willingness to enter meaningful negotiations.</P>

      <P>At the meeting yesterday between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Minister for Labour and myself there was an exchange of views on the dispute in An Post.  It was agreed that the Ministers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would keep in touch with a view to assisting the parties in their preparation for possible further discussions at the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
      <P>The Labour Relations Commission recently sought elaboration from the tribunal on a number of aspects of its recommendations.  I understand that the commission has received a reply from the tribunal and that the commission will consider what further action it can take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post has been suffering financial <Col N="537" /> losses for the past three years.  The company's accumulated losses to the end of 1991 amounted to nearly £14 million and a loss of £8.5 million for 1992 was being projected by the company before the dispute took place.  The company s annual overtime bill is £21 million.  The dispute is causing serious financial damage to An Post as well as problems for users of the service.</P>
    <P>Since March 1991 a total of 41 meetings have been held in an effort to secure agreement on recovering measures. Despite these meetings and the efforts of my predecessor, the Labour Relations Commission and an independent tribunal set up by the commission no agreement has yet been reached on cost reduction measures of any significance.</P>
    <P>During the course of the management/ union negotiations the company paid a total of £18 million to its staff in terms of an arbitration award and the first phase of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  I would call on the unions to reflect on the deteriorating financial situation of An Post and to realise that the future of the company and their own members' jobs are being jeopardised.  I am satisfied that the time has arrived for the unions to display reality and generosity by agreeing to the cost reduction measures now being implemented by An Post.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go down the road of personalities as I do not think it would be profitable nor add in any way to resolution of this dispute.  As Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, I wish to reiterate what I said inside and outside this House, and in the other House, that I am on the side of the national interest and on the side of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The dispute is now in its fifth week and it is vital that an early solution be reached, which will deliver the necessary cost cutting measures, to avoid further damaging effects on the postal service.</P>
    <P>Both sides accept that An Post must be a commercially successful organisation in order to secure its future and the management remain available to talks either directly or under the auspices of the <Col N="538" /> Labour Relations Commission to bring about a speedy and equitable solution.  I would therefore appeal to the unions to reconsider their stance and to adopt a positive and constructive approach and to enter into negotiations and discussions in a spirit of real compromise.  I continue to monitor the whole situation very closely.</P>

      <P>First, I should say that I am sorry that the Minister for Social Welfare is not present in the House and that somebody is deputising for him as his personal intervention is required in order to bring to an end what is an unfair, unreasonable and punitive action taken by his Department.  In effect he is leapfrogging on the postal strike in order to use it as an excuse to delay payments due to social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>Every year, as the House is aware, thousands of decisions are made by the Department of Social Welfare which relate to a range of social welfare benefits and entitlements.  In many cases the applicants have reason to dispute the findings and the appeal procedure finds in favour of the applicant.  Of course we all welcome the appeals procedure because it enables the applicant to have a second bite at the cherry, to appeal and in many cases to have his or her situation vindicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is a greater element of appeal than in the whole area of disability benefit.  I do not have the statistics but I am sure if they were produced we would see quite clearly that there is a great reversal of decisions taken originally by the Department than in any other area of social welfare.  This reflects on the orginal decision and on the manner in which the entire disability regime is operated.  In order to get disability benefit one must, initially, provide certification from a doctor &mdash; usually a GP &mdash; that one is unfit for work.  On sending this to the Department of Social Welfare, within a reasonable period the applicant receives his or her disability <Col N="539" /> benefit.  After a specified period the applicant is then subjected to a medical examination; on the same day one medical practitioner examines many people for a range of ailments, varying from neurosis, thrombosis and arthritis to ulcers, bowel and kidney complaints.  The physician in question must be a jack of all trades.  As the Minister of State knows, very often decisions are contested, on further medical examination by a different medical referee, the original decision is reversed and the person receives full retrospection and arrears to the time when they were originally turned down.  It is all a long and laborious appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>Allegedly, as a result of the postal strike, all disability benefit medical examinations are held up.  It is quite obvious that this is just an excuse to leave people unpaid or on paltry supplementary welfare benefits from the Department of Social Welfare or the health boards, if they are lucky.  Justice delayed is justice denied and in all those cases people have the right of redress at the earliest possible date.  I also venture to suggest that on past analysis and experience the vast majority of cases now held up will, when they eventually are further medically examined, be restored.  However, in the meantime, people remain at a loss.</P>
    <P>I make the point that it is an excuse because I pay tribute to other Government Departments who have managed to circumvent the postal strike by posting salaries, pensions and other benefits outside Dublin.  There is a whole paraphernalia of social welfare, labour exchanges, social welfare offices and officers who can operate the system.  We should use this range of expertise and manpower and realise that many of the applicants have telephones &mdash; or access to them &mdash; if the Department would only make an attempt to contact them.  There is no reason, therefore, for those appeals to be held up.</P>
    <P>I make a heartfelt plea to the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Social Welfare that, where it is possible to establish contact with those people &mdash;<Col N="540" /> which it should be in the vast majority of cases &mdash; the full mechanics, manpower and weight of the Department should be brought to bear to ensure that these appeals go ahead forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest and with some surprise to the position outlined by the Deputy.  However, I am pleased to be able to report that all disability benefit appeals have not been cancelled.  Indeed, the postal dispute to date has resulted in minimal delay in the determination of appeals, mostly affecting a very small number of appellants in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Appeal hearings continue to be heard and outside Dublin the dispute has resulted in few cancellations.  Arrangements have been made to ensure delivery of oral hearing notifications to appellants. For example, of 13 appeals &mdash; of all types &mdash; called for Mullingar, Roscommon and Ballina yesterday and today, all received notifications and have attended.  So far this week in areas outside Dublin there has been a 100 per cent response to notifications in relation to oral hearings &mdash; in only four cases appellants did not turn up and this was in no way due to the postal dispute as messages were sent to the appeals officers at the hearing centres by the appellants indicating their proposed non-attendance.  So far this week the hearings have been conducted at Ballina, Mullingar, Roscommon, Drogheda, Dundalk, Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Monaghan, Naas, Cashel, Mallow and Mitchelstown.</P>
      <P>Within the past week a problem arose in the Dublin area affecting delivery of notifications of intention to hold oral hearings.  The appeals office have been exploring alternative options for notifying appellants with a view to ensuring that these hearings continue to be held. Information on these arrangements was advertised in today's newspapers.  They include a special telephone number which appellants may use to contact the appeals office in regard to arrangements for oral hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> In addition, contact was made with An Post with a view to having correspndence from the appeals office afforded special treatment as they are, in effect, payment related and the Minister is pleased to say that this approach has been favourably received.  These measures should ensure that oral hearings continue to be heard in Dublin.  Particular difficulties arise with a small number of appeals &mdash; about nine &mdash; in Dublin postal districts 1 and 2 and special arrangements will be made for these cases.</P>
    <P>Persons wishing to lodge new appeals against deciding officers' decisions will be unable to post them directly to the appeals office.  However, all local offices of the social welfare services office have been requested to accept appeals on behalf of the appeals office and to forward them for processing.  Some appeals which were posted immediately before the dispute commenced and anything posted since is unlikely to have reached the appeals office.  Today's advertisement addresses this issue by inviting persons who may be in this situation to submit a duplicate notice of appeal at their local social welfare office.  This should avoid any significant delays.</P>
    <P>Some appellants may be understandably concerned that their appeals would be refused as a result of delays caused by this dispute.  While the regulations provide that appeals should be lodged within 21 days of the deciding officer's decision, the chief appeals officer has the discretion to extend this period and this discretion is being exercised so that nobody is penalised for this reason.</P>
    <P>Some reduction in service is, of course, inevitable.  For example, the appeals office cannot guarantee that an acknowledgement will issue in respect of every new appeal while the dispute is in progress. Also, in certain cases it may not be possible to issue formal notification of decisions to appellants.  However, where appeals are successful there should not be any significant delay in restoring payment. I should also mention that many persons who appeal against disallowance of disability benefit meet the PRSI or <Col N="542" /> means conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  Many claim and are paid these benefits pending determination of their appeals.  Where a determination on an appeal can be made without the need for an oral hearing this is also being done and the files are being returned to the relevant social welfare services offices and the pension services office for implementation of the appeals officers' decisions.</P>
    <P>In the light of the position described and the measures outlined to meet the difficult situation, the Minister is satisfied that there is no undue delay in disposing of disability benefit appeals as a result of the postal dispute and there is no evidence that the dispute is causing undue hardship to social welfare appellants.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I want to ascertain who is eligible to accompany a blind person in receipt of a blind person's pension, for the purposes of travel.  This arises from a constituency problem.  A blind man of 30 years of age could not be accompanied by his mother and, consequently, could not travel because he was unable to do so alone.  When I brought the matter to the attention of the Minister's Department the information I received was that only a spouse or a nominated relative could be a companion for travel purposes.  It did not extend in circumstances of a blind person's pension to a parent whereas in relation to other pensions it does extent to parents.  I have the companion qualification in mind.</P>
      <P>I gather that, arising from the budget speech, the Minister for Social Welfare extended the eligibility criteria for those who can properly act as companions to persons who are travelling and who are in receipt of one kind of pension or another.  I have brought this matter to the House tonight because I should have thought that the extension would apply to the category that I was representing, yet the Department of Social Welfare stated that it did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> I ask the Minister to interpret the new policy for me and to state clearly whether a person who is blind can travel accompanied by a parent, with the mother or father being an eligible companion for the purposes of the regulation. If that is the position, somebody in the Departmeht of Social Welfare got it wrong.  On the other hand, if that is not the position I should be interested to hear a reasoned argument that would treat blind people differently from all other categories of pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent budget extended the free travel scheme to provide that the &ldquo;companion pass&rdquo; concession would extend to blind persons in receipt of a non-contributory blind pension from the Department of Social Welfare. The companion pass allows any other person, aged over 16, to accompany the blind pensioner free of charge.</P>
      <P>Prior to the 1992 budget extension, the companion pass was available only to persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance who were unable to travel alone.  The standard free travel pass has always provided that the spouses of a qualified pensioner may travel free while accompanying him or her.</P>
      <P>Following the 1992 budget announcement, arrangements were made to produce a companion pass for approximately 2,000 special welfare blind pensioners. It was planned to issue these passes by post in April, with a request for the return of the standard free travel pass already held by the blind pensioner.</P>
      <P>In view of the difficulties which would be associated with both the issue of the companion passes and the return of the existing passes held by these pensioners as a result of the postal dispute, the companion passes for blind pensioners have not yet issued.  Notwithstanding the contingency system operating for routine weekly issues of free travel passes, there are still evidently some problems with delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Council for the Blind have been informed of the situation and, <Col N="544" /> in the circumstances, have raised no objection to a proposal that distribution of the companion passes be deferred for the present.</P>
    <P>In any particular case in which a blind pensioner may suffer hardship as a result of not receiving his or her companion pass, arrangements may be made &mdash; on request &mdash; to have the pass available for collection at the Department offices at Oisin House, Pearse Street, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the case made by Deputy Noonan.  I wish to confirm that the individual concerned has qualified for the companion pass and arrangements are being made to have that delivered to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter, which is one that I raised in the House before during the Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>I raise the case of one of my constituents who was insurably employed at PRSI Class A prior to attending a FÁS course but has not been awarded Class A credits while attending the FÁS course.  My constituent was in full-time employment and was asked to take a FÁS course.  She was given a categoric assurance from the Department of Social Welfare in Sligo that by attending a FÁS course she would still get full PRSI contributions because she was in full-time employment.  The Minister has most of the details of the case to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1992 my constituent made application for unemployment benefit. Her application was promptly processed, judged eligible and the entitlements were paid.  However, after receiving two or <Col N="545" /> three payments, my constituent was informed that because she was on a FÁS course she did not have full PRSI contributions paid, and payment ceased.  She had already contacted the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin and two senior personnel gave her categoric assurance that she would be entitled to full PRSI Class A1 contributions when doing the FÁS course.</P>
    <P>The case has been doing the rounds in the Department of Social Welfare for the past three months.  As one of my colleagues once said about a file, this is a file of frustration.  I considered that the only way I would be able to get a satisfactory answer to the issue was to raise it here in the House.  I hope the Minister will have a positive reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to by Deputy Reynolds applied for unemployment benefit on 10 January 1992. To qualify for receipt of unemployment benefit a person is required to have paid at least 39 Class A PRSI contributions since first entering insurable employment and to have at least 39 paid or credited contributions in the governing contributions year &mdash; in the case in question, that is the 1990-91 income tax year.</P>
      <P>The person concerned had worked and paid Class D PRSI contributions until 1979, when she gave up work to rear her family.  She resumed working on a part-time basis in June 1990, paying Class A contributions, and in October 1990 she informed the Department of Social Welfare that she had taken up a place in a FÁS training course.  In January 1992 she applied for unemployment benefit and her claim was disallowed on the basis that she did not satisfy the contribution conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her claim for unemployment benefit has been re-examined in the light of the evidence that has been made available to the Department and I am happy to say that arrangements are being made to pay unemployment benefit to the person concerned. I am arranging for any arrears due to be paid to her without delay.  I understand that she is still employed on <Col N="546" /> a part-time basis and is paying Class A contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the case of one of my constituents who was seriously injured at work some years ago.  He received compensation in respect of his injuries, with which compensation he rightly and diligently bought a home for himself and his family.  He is now permanently incapable of work and is in receipt, again correctly, of invalidity pension. He has a wife and four young children and the family live in a rural area.</P>
      <P>I know that the criteria laid down for qualification for free telephone rental allowance requires that the person must be living with another incapacitated person, a person having achieved the correct age, or with children under 15 years of age.  In this case it is because the applicant has a wife who is not incapacitated and would be deemed to be &ldquo;able to summon assistance in the event of emergency&rdquo; that he is not eligible and it is in that regard that I bring the matter before the House tonight.  In fact, the wife would not be in a position to summon assistance in the event of an emergency and at least two such emergencies have occurred in the household in the last six months.</P>
      <P>My real reason for bringing the case to the attention of the Minister now is to ensure that in the event of some serious reversion to my constituent's former state, or a serious state of instability taking place, which would result in the entire attention of his wife and children being devoted to looking after him, assistance could be raised.  Because the family live in a rural area nobody could leave the house in the event of an emergency. My constituent is subject to blackouts and to bouts of severe depression which he regularly talks about and to which he readily admits but cannot at any time predict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I ask the Minister to reconsider the reply given today to Parliamentary Question No. 170.  In view of the medical evidence already supplied to the effect that the applicant's wife would not be in a position to leave the home to summon assistance, nor would any of his <Col N="547" /> children, perhaps he would reconsider the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Durkan said, he received a written reply to Parliamentary Question No. 170 on todays Order Paper.  In view of the Deputy's special interest in the case &mdash; which the Minister knows is a particularly difficult one &mdash; I should like to go over the details again for the benefit of the House.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is an applicant for the free telephone rental allowance, one of the conditions for which requires the applicant to reside alone or only with children under 15 years of age or with other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon assistance in the event of an emergency. This condition is central to access to the allowance on the basis of restricting eligibility to those who are most unlikely to be in a position to get help in the event of an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned, as the Deputy rightly said, resides with his wife and their four young children.  His wife does not suffer from any physical incapacity which would prevent her from summoning assistance in the event of an emergency. Consequently, his application for the free telephone rental allowance has had to <Col N="548" /> be rejected and the applicant has been notified of this decision.</P>
    <P>I know that the Deputy feels very strongly about the circumstances of this case and that something should be done by way of an exception given the particularly difficult circumstances in which the person concerned and his family find themselves.  However, having examined the position in detail, the Minister is satisfied that it would not be possible to make an exception to the rules of the scheme in this type of case without discriminating against other persons who might be in a similar situation.</P>
    <P>Any extension of the scheme in the way envisaged would have significant cost implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.  We are spending over £15 million this year on the free telephone rental allowance alone.</P>
    <P>I regret that it is not possible to facilitiate Deputy Durkan on this occasion. I will bring to the attention of the Minister and the Department the case made by the Deputy in the House this evening and which may well have been made in the past.  Certainly I will bring it first to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <P>This provision covers official entertainment by the Department in Dublin together with State entertainment (i.e. costs arising from official visits to Ireland by foreign Heads of State, Government representatives and other dignitaries). Responsibility for State entertainment was transferred from the Department of Finance to the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1989 and this accounts for the increase shown in that year.</P>
    <P>The very significant increase in expenditure in 1990 arose from costs associated with our EC Presidency and the hosting of a large number of EC meetings in Ireland, including two meetings of the European Council at Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>The pattern of expenditure under this subhead largely reflects the numbers and status of foreign dignitaries visiting Ireland.  Such visits are important in the development of Ireland's relations with other countries and can offer important benefits from the national perspective. Given our commitment to playing an active role in international relations, it is to be expected that a fairly significant number of these visits will take place.  It is a trend that we would not wish to discourage, although we are of course conscious of the budgetary constraints within which we must operate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 150 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Treaty on European Union relevant to any future common defence policy are contained in Articles B, J.4 and N of the Treaty.  These interrelated Articles make it clear that the Treaty does not set up a common defence policy and that the framing of such a policy is a matter for a future negotiation between the member states. Article N provides that another Intergovernmental Conference will be convened in 1996 to examine those provisions of the Treaty for which revision is provided.  And Article J.4.6 provides that the Conference convened under Article N may revise the Common Foreign and Security Policy including the eventual framing of a common defence policy.  This revision would take place on the basis of a report to be presented in <Col N="306" /> 1996 by the Council of Foreign Ministers to the European Council.</P>
    <P>The outcome of future negotiations on a common defence policy will have to be agreed by unanimity and any Treaty changes ratified by member states in accordance with their respective constitutional or legislative procedures.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that, in the light of the European Court's decision in 1987 in the Crotty case, the ratification of the Treaty on European Union would mean that another referendum on a common defence policy would not be required here.  This view seems to be based on a narrow interpretation of one part of the 1987 decision. It ignores the finding of the Court in that same judgment that the State does not have an open-ended authority to agree, without further amendment of the Constitution, to any amendment of the Treaties. It is not possible at this stage to predict the scope of a negotiation that will not take place for another four years, or the content of any future Treaty amendments, but the Government have made it clear that the Irish people will be consulted and will have an opportunity to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any future Treaty establishing a common defence policy or common defence for the Union.</P>
    <P>The Treaty does not contain a mutual defence commitment nor does it require Ireland to join a military alliance.  Moreover it provides that the policy of the Union shall not prejudice the specific character of Ireland's security and defence policy.  The Government consider that our policy of remaining outside military alliances is not affected by the Treaty on European Union and that our position is fully protected.  I believe that the CFSP and the changed security situation in Europe provide an unprecedented opportunity for Ireland to work with other European countries for a more peaceful and stable Europe.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the question of jurisdiction over the continental shelf in the Rockall area was a matter of dispute with the British for many years.  As a result of negotiations these difficulties were resolved and an Agreement between Ireland and Britain on the delimitation of the continental Shelf including in particular large areas of the Rockall Plateau entered into force on the 11th day of January 1990.  No conflicting claim with the British in this area in relation to continental shelf jurisdiction, now remains.

      <P>Cyprus lodged an application for membership of the European Communities on 4 July 1990.  The Council of Ministers in September 1990 decided to initiate the usual procedures for dealing with such an application.  In accordance with Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome the application for membership by Cyprus has been referred to the Commission <Col N="308" /> for an opinion.  When this has been received the Council will consider the matter further.  It would be inappropriate to comment further on the application in advance of this consideration.</P>

      <P>Under the terms agreed for the talks, which were set out in a statement delivered by the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the House of Commons on 26 March 1991, it is open to each of the parties to raise &mdash; and I quote &mdash;&ldquo;any aspect of these relationships, including constitutional issues, or any other matter which it considers relevant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the talks are to achieve their stated objective of &ldquo;a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands&rdquo;, it follows that the various constitutional arrangements which are relevant to these relationships should be open for discussion.</P>
      <P>The Government have indicated on a number of occasions their view that, if Articles Two and Three of the Constitution are to be a subject of discussion in the political talks, it is both equitable and appropriate that the Government of Ireland Act (1920) should also be on the table for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government are aware of the Government's intentions in relation to the Government of Ireland Act. Responding to a Parliamentary Question on 27 February last, the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland recognized that each party was free to raise constitutional issues which it considered relevant. He noted, however, that the <Col N="309" /> outcome of the talks would depend on securing agreement and that all concerned had accepted the principle that a change in the status of Northern Ireland would come about only by consent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 26, 32, 41 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>In Maastricht on 10 December 1991 the nine members of the Western European Union adopted a declaration which invites States which are members of the European Union to accede to the Western European Union on conditions to be agreed, or to become observers.  Nine members of the European Union are members of the Western European Union.  The invitation is therefore addressed to Ireland, Denmark and Greece.  It was officially brought to the attention of the Government after Maastricht in a letter from the current German Presidency of the Western European Union.</P>
      <P>The Government does not intend to accept the invitation to become a member of the Western European Union.  It does, however, see advantages in attending Western European Union meetings as observers as was done last year in the case of Yugoslavia.  These have been set out in the recent White Paper on the Treaty on European Union. Attendance as observers would ensure that Ireland is fully informed of developments within the Western European Union which might have a bearing on discussions in the European Union.  It would better enable the Government to decide on any proposal in the European Union on the reference of defence matters to the Western European Union. And it would enable Ireland to follow the subsequent course of discussions in the Western European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper also makes clear that attendance as observers at the Western European Union would not require Ireland to take up any obligations under the Brussels Treaty establishing the Western European Union or to subscribe to policy positions or platforms adopted by the Western European Union.  Ireland would not become a party to the Western <Col N="311" /> European Union.  Ireland would not become a party to the Western European Union or undertake any mutual defence commitments or military obligations under the Western European Union Treaty.  Discussions between the Western European Union and prospective observers, as well as on the arrangements for new members and associates, will take place later in the year.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have opposed the development of nuclear weapons, advocated nuclear disarmament and supported nuclear nonproliferation. We will continue to pursue these goals within the European Union, as well as in the United Nations and other international organisations in which Ireland participates.  Observer status in the Western European Union would not prevent the Government from continuing these policies.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the speech made by the Secretary General of the Western European Union to the Royal Institute of International Relations in Brussels on 30 March, but I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to comment directly on the views expressed by the Secretary General of the Western European Union on the future of that organisation.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear, however, that the relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union is as established under the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty.  Under the Treaty the Western European Union is not part of the European Union.  It is a separate international organisation established and operating under a separate Treaty.  In this context, I would recall that, under Article J.4 of the Treaty, the policy of the Union will not prejudice the specific character of this country's security and defence policy.</P>
    <P>The declaration adopted by the member States of the Western European Union at the time of the Maastricht Summit confirms this relationship.  It also sets out the relationship between the Western European Union and NATO. <Col N="312" /> The latter relationship, however is not one which involves this country.</P>

      <P>Developments in Mozambique are a cause of great concern. Millions of people are being threatened by famine and drought and tens of thousands have been killed in the civil war.</P>
      <P>There is a relief operation under way in Mozambique co-ordinated by the Mozambique Government and involving the army.  United Nations relief agencies and NGOs, including some Irish ones, are playing an important part in this relief effort.</P>
      <P>While there have been some serious security problems in the delivery of relief to parts of Mozambique, I understand that agreement has now been reached between the parties concerned and relief supplies should be able to reach those in need.  In order to be fully effective, the relief effort requires a cease-fire and ultimately a peace settlement.  It is hoped that negotiations will resume shortly. Ireland, together with our EC partners, is actively supporting efforts aimed at achieving peace.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government have provided bilateral assistance to the relief operation in Mozambique, in the form of cash grants from the disaster relief fund totalling £85,000 (eighty five thousand pounds) since January 1990.</P>
      <P>Ireland, of course, contributes towards the funding of the EC's food aid programmes for Mozambique which in 1992 will amount to about £40 million.  This includes a special provision for Mozambique under the recently agreed EC Special Food Aid Programme.</P>

      <P>Some form of regionalisation of the services currently provided by the Passport office in Dublin is a matter that I would propose to keep under review. There are a number of complex issues involved including both cost factors and, most importantly, the security dimension. In the meantime, however, every effort is being made to maximise efficiency at the Dublin and Cork offices and to continually improve the quality of service to the public.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office in Cork has been very successful since its opening in 1987. During 1991 it handled 18,500 passport applications, representing more than 10 per cent of the national total.  As part of a major recomputerisation project currently at an advanced stage of planning, it is envisaged that computer facilities will be installed in the Cork office within the next couple of years.  At that time I would propose to give sympathetic consideration to upgrading the Cork office to become a full passport issuing office.</P>

      <P>I would recall in this context the Declaration on Anti-Semitism, Racism, Xenophobia and Other Forms of Discrimination issued by the European Council in Dublin on 6 June 1990.

      <P>The question was again considered at the Maastricht European Council on 10 December 1991, at which a further Declaration on Racism and Xenophobia was issued.  That Declaration: &mdash; reiterated the concern felt over the growth in manifestations of racism and xenophobia in Europe; &mdash; stressed the importance of international obligations to combat these evils, to which the Member States have committed themselves in the United Nations, in the Council of Europe and in the CSCE; &mdash; expressed revulsion against racist sentiments, and condemned expressions of prejudice and violence against foreign immigrants in particular; &mdash; called on Governments and Parliaments to act clearly and unambiguously to counter the growth of such sentiments and to strengthen the legal protection of third country nationals where necessary.</P>

      <P>Following the Supreme Court judgment in the X case in February last the Government were concerned that Protocol 17 of the Treaty on European Union could restrict rights to travel and to information under Community law. The option which the Government followed was to seek an amendment to the Protocol which would have all party agreement.  Prior to the General Affairs Council on 6 April the Government and opposition parties were involved in seeking a mutually agreed text.</P>
      <P>On 6 April, amendment of the Protocol was considered by the General Affairs Council.  Any amendment to the Treaty involved the convening of an intergovernmental conference.  While our partners accepted the substance of Ireland's concerns and were willing to help in any way possible they could not agree to convene an intergovernmental conference.  They feared that any opening of the Treaty would lead to demands within other member states for other issues to be addressed by a new intergovernmental conference, and the possible unravelling of the Maastricht package.</P>
      <P>As a result the Solemn Declaration was negotiated and adopted by Council on 1 May.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of reports that the Government preferred to drop Protocol 17.  The option considered by the Government and the main Opposition parties was an amendment to the Protocol. Following the decision to seek to amend the Protocol, the Government were made aware by the Legal Services of the Council of the European Communities that an amendment to or the deletion of the Protocol would require the convening of an intergovernmental conference.  Once the possibility of convening an intergovernmental conference was ruled out by the General Affairs Council on 6 April, the possibility of deleting the Protocol was similarly precluded.</P>

Ceilings, light fittings, air conduits and doors were mostly destroyed or badly damaged. Office furniture and equipment was destroyed or damaged.</P>
      <P>The Embassy personnel would have been at physical risk if the bombing had taken place on a normal working day. Fortunately nobody was in the Chancery at the time as the bombing occurred on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
      <P>As there is no evidence to suggest involvement by the Iranian Government, the question of a protest to that Government does not arise.  A claim of responsibility was made by the Islamic Jihad in Beirut, which said that the attack had been carried out by a suicide bomber.</P>
      <P>The blowing-up of the Israeli Embassy was an appalling atrocity.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs had the opportunity to convey the Government's deepest sympathies to the Government and people of Israel at a meeting he had with the Israeli Ambassador soon afterwards. Minister Andrews also informed the Ambassador that Ireland had joined with its EC partners in making a strong public condemnation of the incident.  Terrorism in any form is totally unacceptable to the Irish Government and, in the context of the Middle East especially, is utterly futile.</P>

In addition to its normal food aid programme, a Special Emergency Programme of 800,000 tonnes of cereals has been agreed for Africa and other regions of the world affected by food shortages.  Of this, 350,000 tonnes are destined for southern African countries. Ireland will contribute over £1 million to this in addition to our bilateral donation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the calendar of shipment and delivery, presumably with regard to the EC Special Programme. Mobilisation of food to drought-affected areas of Africa began under the normal EC food aid programme, before the Special Programme was launched.  The Commission is now in the process of concluding contracts with agents for delivery of the extra supplies at the earliest possible dates.  The Community programme is an enormous undertaking and the precise detils have yet to be finalised.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports regarding the supply of weapons, including Scud missiles, by North Korea to Middle-Eastern countries.  Any supply of such weapons to regions of tension and instability like the Middle East, is always a matter of great concern.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with its EC partners, expressed concern about exports of conventional weapons in a Declaration on Non-Proliferation and Arms Exports which was adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Luxembourg on 29 June 1991.</P>
      <P>This Declaration expressed alarm at the stockpiling of conventional weapons in certain regions of the world.  To prevent situations of instability recurring in entire regions as a result of such overarmament, the European Council stated that far-reaching international action was needed immediately to promote restraint and transparency in the transfers of conventional weapons and of technologies for military use, in particular towards areas of tension.  Ireland participated in the drafting of this Declaration and we give it our full support.</P>
      <P>Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea.  Nevertheless, in whatever contacts we may have with that country, we would certainly convey to them our views in line with the above Declaration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are very concerned about the situation in Somalia, which has developed into an appalling human disaster since the outbreak of the civil war in 1991.  Many thousands of people have lost their lives or been injured in the violence; there are serious food shortages due to drought as well as a massive displacement of persons.</P>
      <P>The scale of the needs is so vast that the problem must be confronted at international level, and I am glad to say that, despite the critical security situation, in particular in Mogadishu, the United Nations and other relief agencies are pressing ahead with the relief effort.</P>
      <P>Ireland is playing its part in the efforts to help the people of Somalia.  So far this year £75,000 has been allocated from the Disaster Relief Fund to agencies involved in relief work there.  In response to representations which have been made to me about the critical needs of Somalia, I have decided to allocate a further £50,000 to Concern and Goal to provide essential medicines and this money will be handed over later this week.  This will bring the total Government bilateral contribution to £125,000 this year.</P>
      <P>The European Community is helping with emergency relief and long term aid. The total value of EC assistance to Somalia so far is £24 million of which £10 million was allocated under the recently agreed Special Food Aid Programme.</P>
      <P>On the political front, Ireland has fully supported and will continue to support the United Nations initiatives aimed at restoring peace in Somalia.</P>

      <P>The Government are making every effort to ensure that information is available to the electorate to enable them to make an informed judgment on the Treaty on European Union.  The Government published a White Paper on the contents of the Treaty last month which is available from the Government Publications Sale Office at a price of £5. The Government have published a short guide to the Treaty which is being distributed without charge at present to all the householders in the country.  Leaflets explaining particular aspects of the Treaty will be available before the Referendum.</P>
      <P>The retail price of copies of the Treaties establishing the European Communities, as amended by the Single European Act is £80 for the two volume hardback set.  However, an abridged paperback version of this publication which contains all the essential texts is available at £11.60.</P>
      <P>Copies of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union retail at £6.95.</P>
      <P>Both of these publications are available from the Government Publications Sale Office.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate access to the text of the Treaty on European Union to as many people as possible, arrangements have been made for copies of the Treaty to be available for perusal by members of the public in libraries and main post offices throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> The Government are aware of reports that the Danish Government have distributed half a million copies of the Treaty free of charge.  It is estimated that the cost of circulating all of the households in the country would be in excess of £6 million including purchase and distribution costs.  The Government are of the view that, having regard to the availability of the text of the Treaty in public libraries and main post offices, such an expensive distribution would be difficult to justify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 2.7 of the UN Charter provides that nothing in the Charter shall authorise the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.  This is of course without prejudice to the application of enforcement measures against a member state under Chapter VII.</P>
      <P>The UN Charter also, however, contains a number of general provisions on human rights and these have been the basis for some important developments over nearly half a century notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2.7.  Over that period, the Organisation has developed a network of major Human Rights Conventions and established a number of Commissions and other subsidiary bodies which do important work to promote Human Rights and to monitor their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rights of minorities for example, are a particular concern of the Subcommission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities established by the UN Commission on <Col N="324" /> Human Rights.  Genocide is a particularly appalling crime, involving as it does, an attempt not merely to discriminate against, but to eliminate a whole people. Genocide has been outlawed by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide to which over one hundred states, including Ireland, are now parties.  The Convention came into effect in 1951.  Under its terms the Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.</P>
    <P>While these provisions are important, I share the Deputy's concern to see better international protection for the rights of minorities.  It is not realistic at present however to envisage doing this by way of a direct amendment of Article 2.7 of the UN Charter.  Any amendment of the Charter, would, in accordance with Article 108, require the support of two-thirds of the member states, including that of all five Permanent Members of the Security Council.  Such support for an amendment of Article 2.7 does not exist at present.</P>
    <P>I would add that Ireland has always insisted that all States are under obligation to uphold fundamental human rights and to implement in full their commitments under international human rights instruments.  We do not see efforts by the international community to secure implementation of human rights in accordance with the UN Charter as in any way an unwarranted interference in a country's internal affairs.</P>

      <P>A pension under the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees is based on the annual rate of pay on the last day of reckonable service less twice the annual amount of Social Welfare Contributory Old Age Pension payable to a single person.  The person <Col N="329" /> referred to by the Deputy qualified for a pension under the scheme.  Because, however, his annual rate of pay was only slightly greater than twice the annual amount of the relevant Contributory Old Age Pension his scheme pension is only nominal.</P>
      <P>The issue of pensions payments is a matter for the Paymaster General's Office, to whom the necessary authorisation was issued by my Department in this case.  It is understood from the Department of Finance that the question of commuting pensions of nominal amount, such as applies in this case, to once-off lump-sum payments is under examination at present.</P>

    <P>The Review of Industrial Performance 1990 which was undertaken by my Department, examined, <i>inter alia,</i> the position of overseas industry in Ireland and their contribution to the Irish economy. <Col N="330" /> There are almost 1,000 overseas firms in Ireland, which, between them, employ some 90,000 people.  This is equivalent to 40 per cent of the industrial workforce.  They account for 50 per cent of manufactured output and three quarters of industrial exports.</P>
    <P>The Irish Economy Expenditure survey carried out on an annual basis by the IDA analyses the expenditure by overseas companies located here on Irish services, raw materials and wages and salaries.  The 1990 Survey (latest figures available) showed that total Irish economy expenditure of overseas industry amounted to £3,744 million broken down as follows:</P>

    <P>The recent Culliton Report on Industrial Policy has acknowledged the benefits accruing to the Irish economy from the foreign firms located here and the additional benefits generated by their spin-off demand.</P>
    <P>Apart from their Irish economy expenditure I understand from the IDA that in general multinational companies already contribute significantly to local community initiatives in their area.  I understand that numerous activities are assisted in this way throughout the country including community development and job creation generally.</P>
    <P>I also understand from the IDA that the current capital grant agreement which multinational companies in the manufacturing and international services sectors enter into with the Authority <Col N="331" /> incorporates features for the control and security of the monies paid.</P>
    <P>These are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;A performance clause where the grants are paid out against the achievement of agreed targets.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A clawback clause where grants are required to be repaid in the event of failure to maintain job targets.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A parent company guarantee where the parent or a nominated company which is a party to the grant agreement guarantees the repayment of the grants paid in the event of the failure of the grantee company to repay due to closure, receivership, liquidation etc.</P>
    <P>The IDA have informed me that all grantees must also comply with a number of conditions when submitting a claim for grant payment.</P>

      <P>The 1992 Finance Bill provides for the application, from 1 July next, of the 12.5 per cent rate of VAT to the provision of facilities for taking part in sporting activities, other than where provided by non-profit making bodies.  Thus, the use of all such facilities provided on a commercial basis will be liable to the tax; this will apply to commercially-run golf courses in the same way that it will to other profit-oriented outlets such as bowling alleys or squash courts.  These arrangements, which will remove anomalies of tax treatment within the commercial sporting area, are entirely in keeping with the EC VAT law.  Determination of the tax status of any particular club or establishment will be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 97 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools, I presume that the questions refer to schools in the Free Education Scheme. The basic condition for entry to that scheme is that payment would not be sought in respect of</P>
      <P>1.  Instruction in any subject listed in the general school programme,</P>
      <P>2.  Recreational or study facilities of which all the pupils are expected to avail themselves as part of the school programme,</P>
      <P>3.  Any other activity in which all pupils are required to take part.</P>
      <P>Subject to these conditions, it would be in order for schools in the scheme to accept contributions of a voluntary nature, provided that it is made clear to parents that these contributions are entirely voluntary and are not a condition for the admission of pupils.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on record that I am opposed to selection tests for the purpose of enrolment of children in post-primary schools.  I am eqully opposed to the imposition of charges on a non-voluntary basis on parents in respect of the enrolment of their children.</P>

The admission of pupils is, however, a matter for the individual school authorities.</P>

      <P>My Department provides for the education of children with mild mental handicap at primary level in a number of ways.</P>
      <P>Integration of such children into the mainstream education is encouraged, where appropriate, but provision is also made for those who cannot be successfully integrated.  These children may attend special schools or special classes in ordinary national schools.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 32 special schools and 151 special classes for mildly mentally handicapped children.  In addition, there have been a number of recent initiatives under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, targeted specifically at the needs of such children.</P>
      <P>These initiatives include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;7 new resource teacher posts</P>
      <P>&mdash;6 additional visiting teacher posts</P>
      <P>&mdash;a reduction in the pupil/teacher ratio in special schools for mildly mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>The Special Education Review Committee will be examining the question of appropriate provisions for children with special needs, including those with mild mental handicap, and I will give due consideration to whether additional measures are appropriate in the light of the Committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>The key principle which informs my Department's policy in relation to the education of mildly handicapped pupils at post-primary level is that, where appropriate, such education should be provided in special classes in ordinary schools, rather than in special schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to assist post-primary schools to cater for the needs of pupils assessed as being mildly handicapped, my Department will authorise a teaching post in <Col N="351" /> the appropriate post-primary school in addition to the normal quota.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics supplied to my Department by primary schools, relating to enrolment on 30 September 1991, indicates that 1,898 pupils were enrolled in sixth class for the second time.</P>
      <P>The exclusion of pupils repeating sixth class in reckoning a school's enrolment for staffing purposes does not necessarily result in the loss of a teaching post, or refusal for an additonal appointment. The appointment and retention of teachers is governed by an enrolments schedule and, depending on where a school's enrolment figure occurs on the schedule, exclusion of the pupils in question may have no effect on the number of teachers warranted in the school.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> over-all teacher numbers during the Programme are related to the national pupil/teacher ratio.  Accordingly, the schedule governing teacher appointments is adjusted so that numbers of posts being reduced are matched by numbers of posts added.</P>

    <P>The causes of Sudden Infant Death are not known.  As a result of recent studies concerning Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Cot Death) and following consultation between the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and the Faculty of Paediatrics of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, my Department recommend the following guidelines which may help parents and those caring for babies to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Deaths:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a baby should be placed on his or her back or side to sleep</P>
    <P>&mdash;babies should not be allowed to become too warm</P>
    <P>&mdash;expectant mothers should not smoke nor allow anyone to smoke near the baby during the first year of life</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" />&mdash;if at all possible mothers should breastfeed babies for the first few weeks, not because this in itself reduces the risk of cot death, but because it may reduce the risk of infection.</P>
    <P>In 1991 a grant of £24,500 was made from the National Lottery funds to the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association (ISIDA) and further grants of £23,000 are committed in both 1992 and 1993 towards the cost of establishing a national register of cot deaths.  This register will form a valuable data base for research into the problem.</P>
    <P>The use of appropriate monitoring devices may from time to time be recommended by a family doctor or a Public Health Nurse.  Families who are concerned are advised to contact their family doctor or Public Health Nurse on those matters.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government were represented, as observer, at a Ministerial meeting of the Western European Union Council which took place at the time of the Maastricht European Council last December.  At this meeting, the Western European Union discussed its future relations with the European Union and the invitation to be issued to members of the European <Col N="368" /> Union to become members or observers of the Western European Union.</P>
      <P>The Government had previously attended as observer two earlier meetings of the Western European Union Council which were convened last year to consider the Yugoslav crisis and the steps the Western European Union might take to support the European Community's peace process including its Monitor Mission.</P>
      <P>In all three cases, the Government's decision to attend as observer was based on their desire to be fully informed on all developments that would have a bearing on matters under discussion within the European Community.</P>
      <P>Pending a decision by Government on the response to be given to the invitation from the member states of the Western European Union to States which are members of the European Union to accede to the Western European Union or to become observers, the question of the future representation of the Government, as observer, at any future meetings of the Ministerial Council of the Western European Union will be considered on the same basis as attendance at the meetings to which I have already referred.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Platform adopted by the Western European Union in 1987, I have arranged for copies of this to be placed in the Dáil Library.  In this connection, I would like to point out that this Platform is binding on member states of the Western European Union only. Attendance at Western European Union meetings as an observer would not require Ireland to take up any obligations under the Brussels Treaty or to subscribe to policy positions or platforms adopted by the Western European Union.</P>

The European Community and its member states have instructed their Ambassadors in Latin American countries to monitor closely the situation of underground and street children and to report regularly on the matter.  Governments in the region are being actively encouraged at every opportunity to do all in their power to resolve this problem.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I am personally concerned about the delays being experienced by members of the public in obtaining passports as a result of the current postal dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Passport Office processes approximately 180,000 passport applications each year.  On average 30 per cent of these are issued during the months of May and June; 60 per cent of all applications are normally submitted and delivered through the postal system.  As a result of the postal dispute the vast <Col N="371" /> majority of these applications are being submitted and collected in person.</P>
    <P>The very large increase in the number of persons calling to the Passport Office is causing considerable difficulties both for members of the public and for the Passport Office.  To date the following measures have been taken: about 80 extra members of staff have been recruited on a temporary basis, in addition to the normal staff complement of about 40; extra overtime is being worked; the Passport Office is being opened each Saturday to facilitate the collection of passports; priority is being given to those members of the public who are travelling in the immediate future; arrangements are also in place so that members of the public may deliver their applications and/or collect their passports either in person, through a courier or by an agreed third party.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme for the Control of Farmyard Pollution (CFP) which was introduced in Ireland in 1989 as an Operational Programme, a sum of £66.4 million was made available from the Structural Funds to finance expenditure over the years 1989-1993.</P>
      <P>To date 27,000 farmers have applied for the scheme and approvals have issued in 25,000 cases leaving over 2,000 to be dealt with.  These approvals have exhausted Ireland's allocation under the Scheme.</P>
      <P>As all the outstanding approvals are unlikely to reach completion it has been decided to cancel those approvals where the completion date has expired.  This should release some of the committed funds and make it possible to deal with a substantial number of applications on hands within the current financial allocation.</P>
      <P>The cancellation of approvals where the completion date has expired will still leave over 10,000 approved projects under the CFP Scheme where work is incomplete.  These outstanding approvals are sufficient to ensure that pollution control work will continue under the Scheme into late 1993.  In addition grants for this type of work continue to be available under the Farm Improvement Programme.</P>

      <P>The existing intradermal tuberculin test is the officially recognised test for bovine TB, both at EC level and internationally and there are no proposals to diminish the status of that test. The absence of visible lesions at post mortem examination does not mean that the animal does not have bovine TB.  In some cases reactor animals will have been identified before lesions develop while in other cases, lesions, though present, may be so small as to be undetectable by visual examination.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that in the future a suitable blood test could be used to augment the tuberculin test.  In this regard a number of research projects into the development of diagnostic blood based tests are being undertaken.

      <P>Discussions are ongoing with the Irish Veterinary Union in regard to the EC Commission's requirement for a changed method of allocation of testing to veterinary surgeons.  Meeting this requirement would enable drawdown of EC funding amounting to at least £30 million over a 3 year period.</P>
      <P>Under the current arrangements a herdowner can obtain a herd test on request.  Almost one third of the country's 172,000 herds had a test in 1992 which is a higher than normal rate of progress for an annual round.  A comprehensive testing programme amounting to 8 million animal tests which focused on restricted and contiguous herds was carried out in 1991.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for Free Telephone Rental Allowance in January 1992.  One of the conditions for receipt of this allowance is that the applicant must reside alone or only with children under 15 years of age or with other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon assistance in the event of an emergency.</P>
      <P>The person concerned resides with his wife and their four young children.  As his wife does not suffer from any physical incapacity which would prevent her from summoning assistance in the event of an emergency, his application for the allowance had to be rejected.  The person concerned was notified of this decision.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficult circumstances in which the person concerned and his family find themselves.  However, it would not be possible to make an exception to the rules of the scheme in this type of case without discriminating against other persons who might be in a similar situation.</P>

She appealed against this decision to the independent <Col N="382" /> Social Welfare Appeals Office and she was referred for a further medical examination by a different Medical Referee who also deemed her capable of work.  Her appeal was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing of her appeal.  This will be arranged for the week commencing 15 June 1992.  The person concerned has been in receipt of Unemployment Benefit pending the determination of her appeal.</P>
