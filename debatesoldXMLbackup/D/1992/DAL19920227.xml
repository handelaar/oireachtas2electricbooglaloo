      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal in relation to Standing Orders attempts to deal with the anomalies which have arisen because of the resignation of both myself and my colleagues from The <Col N="790" /> Workers' Party, thereby reducing The Workers' Party to one Deputy in this House.  Clearly, I accept that one Deputy should not have the same full rights as a group in this House.</P>

      <P>I also oppose the proposal that Nos. 8 and 9 be taken without debate.  On behalf of the Independent and small party Deputies I have been pleading unsuccessfully that we be given more time and consideration in this House.

      <P>Despite the best expert advice, we cannot find seven.  I beg your indugence, Sir, as I would like on behalf of The Workers' Party Dáil group to express my great appreciation and thanks to myself for the great support that I have given to myself during the past few trying days.  I want to assure you, a Cheann Comhairle, that there is now full unanimity and concern and that there will be no further splits in The Workers' Party.</P>
      <P>Question: &ldquo;That Nos. 8 and 9 be taken without debate,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and adjourn at 4 p.m. satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals in respect of tomorrow's business, that is, Nos. 10 and 11, in the matter of divisions and business to be conducted, satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Tánaiste, in view of the fact that during the week one of the courts decided that sections of the Companies Act were unconstitutional, what proposals the Government have to amend the Companies Act or to hold a referendum?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="The Tánaiste John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That question was asked and answered yesterday.  Were it not for the fact that I know of the humaneness and courtesy of Deputy Barry I would think that he was trying to make me make a different statement from the one the Taoiseach made yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste say whether the Government have given consideration to the method by which this House will discuss the Supreme Court decision which will be published next week?  If not, will the Government give urgent consideration to making time available in this House next week so that the consensus and the spirit of co-operation established by the Taoiseach last week among party leaders can be built on and used effectively?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the appropriate time for dealing with the matter.  There are many other ways of raising it and it is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time for an explanation. It is probably the most relevant matter in a long time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton suggested yesterday that a possible method of doing this would be for the Government to bring forward an Estimate in respect of the Attorney General's Office. That should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="The Tánaiste John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Spring knows that the Taoiseach is in London performing a very important task for the country.  The Supreme Court judgment was handed down yesterday and he knows that there has not been a meeting of the Government since to consider this. <Col N="793" /> The question of an Estimate for the Attorney General's Office can be considered by the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Supreme Court have delivered their judgment &mdash; presumably some time next week &mdash; will the Tánaiste consider providing for a full debate in this House on the implications of the judgment?  Although we proposed and passed an amendment to the Constitution in 1983 we have not yet introduced legislation arising from that amendment.  Perhaps the Tánaiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be discussions this morning regarding next week's business and I ask that time be set aside next week &mdash; on the assumption that the judgement be delivered early next week &mdash; for this House to debate the issue.  In that context I also ask the Tánaiste to communicate with the Taoiseach to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Following publication of the judgement there should be further discussions between party leaders to see where we go from here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be disorderly and I appreciate, Sir, that you are administering the rules as laid down. I wish to reinforce the request by the Labour Party leader to the Tánaiste.  We appreciate time constraints and the fact that the Taoiseach is on important business in London.  Will this matter be discussed by the Government at the earliest possible opportunity and time made <Col N="794" /> available &mdash; and the decision communicated through the Whips in the normal manner &mdash; some time next week when the judgment is available?  I am sure that the Government would like to maintain the assistance of the Opposition parties on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní gá bheith chomh borb sin.  Beidh cathaoirleach agus rúnaí ag an gcomhchoiste sin agus déanfaidh mise mo dhícheall, mar Aire na Gaeltachta, an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh sa Teach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Tánaiste or the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in respect of the promised amendment to the Companies Act, the Minister will give consideration to whether a further amendment is necessary in the light of the manner in which 150 workers have lost their jobs at Atlantic Magnetics in Clondalkin arising from a perceived deficiency in the operation of the Companies Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised that on the Order of Business yesterday the Government Chief Whip or the Taoiseach did not seem to know that the Government had committed themselves to legislation to have sub-county elections in 1992.  As the commitment was given by the Tánaiste, will he now clarify the position?  Will legislation be introduced in respect of sub-county elections <Col N="796" /> this year and, if so, when will it be brought before the House?  Will he also clarify, once and for all, whether the Government are proceeding with the idea of district council elections in 1992?</P>

      <P>In view of the widespread confusion and distress among Irish language speakers, what are the intentions of the Government in relation to promised legislation?  There has been much legislation promised in the area of education.  May I ask what is the present status of the University of Limerick Act which was agreed by this House and which allowed Irish speakers to enter Limerick University with full recognition of the Irish language?  Can the Tánaiste tell me if it is the Government's intention to vindicate the Act passed by this House or will they bring forward reforming legislation to rationalise the <i>ultra vires</i> behaviour of the head of the University of Limerick?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned yesterday evening, I was outlining to the House the role played by the Irish Land Commission in the area of land reform since 1881.  I had outlined the position up to the end of the seventies.  By the end of the seventies it was generally accepted that the Land Commission had outlived its usefulness.  There were a number of reasons for this.  In the first instance, the pool of large estates available for acquisition had declined considerably and, accordingly, the Land Commission found themselves acquiring smaller, unused properties, the acquisition of which, in general, proved long and tedious as owners availed of their statutory rights to oppose proceedings to the limit.  In view of the small areas involved the contribution of this activity to the land settlement programme was minimal and it was questionable whether the effort and cost involved in the necessarily long drawn-out acquisition procedures could be justified in terms of results.  Another important factor was the rise in land prices. These were far in excess of what the Land Commission could recover on re-sale and the subsidies involved were putting an increasing strain on the taxpayer.  There was also the growing unacceptability of land bonds as a means of payment. Accordingly, it was decided to terminate acquisition and dispose of the lands on hands as quickly as possible.  No land has been acquired since 1983 and only about 2,500 hectares of agricultural land remain on hands at present.  It is expected that this will be disposed of by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is designed to give statutory effect to the position which has obtained since 1983.  In short, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Land Commission; the revocation of the power of the State to take over land, except by exchange, for land settlement purposes; the transfer to the President of the High Court of the jurisdictions vested in the Office of the Judicial Commissioner and in the Appeal Tribunal; the transfer to the Minister for Agriculture and Food of certain functions <Col N="803" /> of the commission and the four lay commissioners, mainly to allow for the disposal of land on hand and for the continuation of controls in the purchase of land by non-qualified persons; the transfer to the Minister of all land and other property vested in the commission, with the exception of fishing rights and fisheries which will be transferred to the Central Fisheries Board and the payment of compensation to the lay commissioners.</P>
    <P>I should like to make clear that the enactment of this Bill will not affect the continuation of certain work and functions of the commission.  These are: the disposal of the small area of land now left on hands; the revesting in the names of the new owners of land already allotted and of land yet to be allotted; the exercise of statutory control over the subdivision of farms and over the purchase of land by non-qualified persons, mainly companies and non-EC nationals; the promotion of group purchase and leasing of land as well as provision of assistance for schemes for rearrangement and commonage division and miscellaneous matters and to the obligations, such as the collection of annuities, custody of title documents, the management of lands awaiting disposal, responsibilities of the offices of Examiner of Title and of Public Trustee.</P>
    <P>There is a certain reluctance when it comes to putting on one side a body who have had such an important part in our country's history.  The fact is, however, that for some years the Land Commission have ceased to function as a body who acquired and disposed of land.  The situation which brought forth the Land Commission is no longer with us.  The whole basis of Irish agriculture has been changed since our entry into the EC.  The point is of particular relevance in regard to the position of the Land Commission as the body who took over and disposed of land.  The demand for that kind of activity is gone.  The primary function of the Land Commission over the last 60 years was to create as many viable farms as possible in accordance with the social directives of the Constitution.  This is still the objective of public policy and the Government are fully committed to it. <Col N="804" /> However, we can no longer depend on some State agency like a land authority to fulfil this obligation.  Instead we turn to the Common Agricultural Policy through its support for agricultural products and the various schemes being financed by the Structural Funds.  There is a range of EC structural measures available at present to help the farmer.  These include incentives for modernisation of farms, the promotion of alternative enterprises, including agri-tourism, headage payments, etc.  I am convinced that the best hope of maintaining and strengthening the family farm is by using these incentives to the full.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that we have no need to be afraid of winding up the Land Commission.  At any rate the demand for land has been greatly reduced due to Community measures to cut back on production.  There is therefore no longer any pressure for any new initiative in the field of land policy.  It seems to be generally accepted that, given the range and scale of the structural aid now available, land mobility can be left to market forces and that in future the role of the State will be limited to subdivision control, the control of sales to non-EC nationals, commonage division, to which I have referred, and rearrangement and group purchase.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to express my gratitude to and admiration of the work carried out by the staff of the Land Commission.  That sentiment has been expressed on many occasions by Deputies in this House.  Their dedication to Irish agriculture and in particular to improving the lot of the smallholder is well known and appreciated in every parish in the country.  The demise of the Land Commission is due essentially to the completion of their task.  That task was both a viable and historic one and was carried out effectively, often in the face of the most difficult human circumstances and always in accordance with necessarily cumbersome legal procedures.</P>
    <P>No one will claim that this work was perfect and the critics will point to the fact that there is still a considerable number of <Col N="805" /> holdings below the economic standard. To accept that it has not been possible to bring every holding in the country up to standard is not to indict performance.  It is more a question of insufficient land being available to meet the demand.  It can be said, however, that over the years there were very few farms that did not get some benefit from land settlement operations and there were many that benefited substantially.  Given all the constraints, legal and otherwise, within which the Land Commission had to operate, this was quite an achievement.  No one can deny that the social dimensions of the Land Commission were considerable. Most commentators agree that by stabilising the farming population it saved the fabric of rural life, particularly in the west of Ireland.  It is hard to imagine how bad conditions were in the thirties and forties when thousands of smaller farmers were on the destitution line.  The only hope they had of surviving was by getting a few more acres of land. As they could not afford to buy this themselves they had to depend on the Land Commission to give it to them.  Without these allotments, small as they were, many of the farms would have disappeared as their owners would have gone abroad.  The country owes a debt of gratitude to the public servants who over the years developed and implemented the policies of the Land Commission.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be opposing this Bill, considering that we introduced it in the middle eighties and that the last acquisition by the Land Commission was in 1983.  However, I would take issue with the Minister on one specific statement in his speech when referring to the abolition of the Land Commission.  He said: &ldquo;There is therefore no longer any pressure for any new initiative in the field of land policy&rdquo;.  That statement is regrettable and highly undesirable.  Of course there is need for a new initiative.  We, in our intent to abolish the Land Commission, made it quite clear that we would set up a land authority to manage the land resources of the country once the <Col N="806" /> Land Commission were abolished.  I do not want to be highly political on this, but if the Minister looks back on his party's election manifesto of 1987 he will see that Fianna Fáil promised that a land authority would be set up following the dissolution of the Land Commission.  We are entitled to know why this Government have seen fit to renege on that election promise.  A land authority of some kind is absolutely essential, and I will develop that point at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Initially, when this Bill was introduced in this House in May 1989, there was quite a lengthy debate on it, ranging over a number of days.  However, in the midst of that debate a general election was called in May 1989.  For the information of the new Members to the House, and to remind Members who were here at the time, we are now starting ths debate.</P>
      <P>As the Minister rightly pointed out in his opening address, the Land Commission were set up in 1881 following a protracted period of great unrest, culminating in the land wars.  People died during the agitation over land at that period and there was great suffering and hardship.  The landlord system, which dates back to Cromwellian and penal times, was eventually disbanded.  One could say we have gone the full circle and today we are about to dissolve what was set up in the interests of the Irish farmer, particularly the Irish smallholder.  Theoretically, a new landlord system could develop in Ireland in that any EC national is now allowed to buy as much land here as he or she wishes if he or she has the money.  There is nothing to stop individuals buying a million acres so long as they are EC nationals.  The general public should be aware of that, but I do not wish to be a scaremonger because I do not believe such massive activity will occur.</P>
      <P>We are members of the EC and we have to abide by the rules of the Community. It is obvious that considerable estates will be built up by non-Irish EC nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People ask whether the Land Commission were a failure.  That is a difficult question to answer and one would have to qualify one's answer.  I am of the opinion that the Land Commission were not a failure but the Commission could never <Col N="807" /> win.  The Commission had the impossible task of dividing estates and of building up smaller farms.  The objective was to create a viable farm entity.  Therein lies the question of what is a viable farm.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago the Land Commission defined a viable farm as being one of 45 acres of reasonably good land. In today's world, of course, 45 acres is not sufficient.  In today's terms a viable farm would probably have to comprise 150 to 250 acres of reasonably good land, depending on the type of agricultural activity to be carried out.  One could say that the Land Commission failed miserably because there are still tens of thousands of farms here, particularly in the west, that range from ten to 30 acres in size.</P>
    <P>It could be said that the Land Commission failed because even the aim of creating farms of 45 acres of reasonably good land was not achieved and most farms are of ten acres or less up to 30 acres.  It is very hard to blame the Land Commission because if they had pursued a policy of making every farm at least 45 acres then the country would have been denuded of a huge number of its people.  There are approximately 170,000 people engaged in farming today but if all land units were of 150 to 200 acres then the number involved in farming could go down to about 20,000 or 30,000.  If an economist were to carry out a study of the number of farmers there would be if all farm units were to be viable I am sure the forecast number would be very small.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission had an unenviable task, they were between the devil and the deep blue sea.  They could aim either to keep as many people on the land as possible or have units so large that they would get rid of the bulk of farmers.  The Commission did not have an easy decision to make and I realise, particularly when taking social factors into consideration, that they did their best.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have been left with a form of farming that relegates most farmers to dependency on handouts.  We are lucky they will receive funding from Europe rather than from the national <Col N="808" /> Exchequer.  Whether the handouts come in the form of small farmers dole, unemployment assistance, or the compensatory measures promised from Europe, for the vast bulk of farmers the future lies in handouts.  That is not a very attractive prospect but it is the way our farmers will survive.</P>
    <P>I shall not delve too far into the historical background of the Land Commission or of the landlord system.  We should look ahead, and it is the future I wish to speak about today.  That is my reason for objecting to a part of the Minister's script.  It was an unfortunate inclusion.  There is a need for a new look to be taken at land policy in Ireland.  It does not have to be entirely tied up with agriculture.  There have been so many changes in the past 20 years that the whole scene needs to be re-assessed but, unfortunately, no one is big enough, inventive enough, innovative enough or courageous enough to do that.  We are letting our people, particularly those living in rural areas, down unless we grasp the nettle and devise new ways of giving those living in rural areas a chance to make a living.</P>
    <P>I can think of many names for the new authority.  It could be called a land authority, but I would go further and call it a land use authority.  The policy of that body should embrace not only farming but also forestry, agri-tourism and other outdoor activities.  Studies should be carried out to determine how many jobs those forms of activity could create.  It may be that in the EC, a Community of 340 million, our land could be put to better use than the rearing of cattle and other animals or the growing of tillage crops such as grain and sugar beet.</P>
    <P>The obvious alternative to farming is an activity that at the moment is a bone of contention in many parts of the country, particularly in the west of Ireland, that is afforestation.  Nobody has ever tried to work out the merits or demerits of afforestation <i>vis-á-vis</i> agriculture.  Could we create more jobs per acre from afforestation than from farming as we have known it, or is afforestation a way of eliminating a lot of farmers from the land?  Which is the most profitable in terms of jobs?  As far as I know, nobody has even attempted to do a study; but it <Col N="809" /> has to be done.  We could call it the initial stage of a land use policy.  What employment could our land provide if much of it was used for agri-tourism or outdoor leisure activities?  What wealth would it generate?  I have my doubts about afforestation providing more jobs than agriculture, but I have no doubt that land used for leisure activities or for agri-tourism would generate considerably more jobs than is presently generated on a lot of our inferior land.  There has not been a study to show that my belief is correct and we need studies on this issue.</P>
    <P>If 20,000 or 30,000 acres of a 100,000 or 200,000 mountain range were set aside for breeding and cultivating game birds and animals, that could be instrumental in providing dozens and perhaps hundreds of jobs, whereas at present the area might be responsible for creating jobs for perhaps one dozen or two dozen sheep farmers.  Has anybody ever given that a bit of thought?  I understand that one cannot have game birds in conjunction with sheep because the sheep apparently nip the budding and flowering heather which is also a source of nutrients for game birds.  Therefore sheep render that type of mountainous land uninhabitable for game birds.  About 100 years ago a mountain range near me was famous for game birds such as woodcock, grouse and a whole lot of other game.  Nowadays it has no game birds worth talking about and there is no attraction for sportsmen who want to shoot.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of a greater growth area in leisure pursuits or outdoor sports than shooting, fishing and hunting.  The bulk of our inferior quality land is not attractive for game life.  Therefore it has no appeal from the point of view of tourism and it cannot generate jobs and wealth. We must examine the feasibility of using this type of land for activities which will be beneficial to the nation.  I know that what I am saying is a bit offbeat but my instinct is that I am right.  That is why I find the sentence in the Minister's statement totally alien to the good of this country and its people.  We should start innovating and thinking.  We should not just confine ourselves to the land masses. We should consider our waterways and water courses, many of which have <Col N="810" /> already been drained, thus eliminating numbers of game birds such as duck and associated families like quail, snipe and so on.  Drainage seemed like a good idea at the time, but nowadays it might not be such a good idea at all.</P>
    <P>We have a ferocious contradiction in the system of government in Ireland and in the EC.  The EC are paying people to set aside the best land, to waste it, to let it go sterile, while at the same time we and the EC pay people large grants to reclaim and slightly improve the worst quality land in the country.  Can anybody explain that logic?  I would like to know how many millions or billions of pounds the EC will spend in 1992 to persuade farmers not to use their land and how many millions they will spend in 1992 to pay people to reclaim inferior quality land.  The system is haywire.  It is upside down.  We should be vigilant from today onwards, although perhaps it is too late in some cases, to preserve the habitats for wildlife here, because that wildlife could be the wealth of this country in years to come.  We are not giving it a second thought.  That is a disgrace.  From now on we should ensure that no ponds are drained, no streams got rid of or no marshland interfered with until we have a coherent Community policy on the use of land and how much land we need for production.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be patronising but it is a great pity that Deputy John O'Donoghue did not retain his portfolio in the recent Cabinet re-shuffle because I believe he is one of the few Deputies who understands what needs to be done and understands what I am talking about and as Minister of State was capable of doing something about it.</P>
    <P>We have debated the issue of job creation and the setting up of a jobs forum.  We have the ability to create tens of thousands of jobs under our feet but we just do not recognise how it should be done.  I am alluding to how that can be done and I hope that my remarks will be taken on board.  I do not know how the Minister of State will raise this matter as he is not a member of Cabinet.  We are destroying rather than exploiting our potential to create jobs.</P>
    <P>We should have very clear projections <Col N="811" /> of the income to be generated from the types of alternative enterprises I have suggested and clear projections on how much employment could be created.  We should then compare that with the <i>status quo.</i>  We should examine whether the two dozen farmers who are grazing sheep on tens of thousands if not 100,000 acres of mountain would be better off if the mountains were preserved for activities which could generate tourism and thereby create a great many jobs.  I believe they would be considerably better off and they would have to endure a lot less hardship; indeed, their sons and daughters might then not have to emigrate as they could be employed along with many other people in the area.  I am sure if the Dutch or the Germans had our natural resource of land they would have done something along these lines years ago.</P>
    <P>I am sure other Members will have a great deal to say about the Land Commission which was established in 1881, over 111 years ago.  I am not interested in looking back in time.  I am more interested in looking to the future.  I will leave it to my colleagues to comment on the division of estates, the amalgamation of smaller farms and the problem that farmers are experiencing with land annuities.  I came in to express a single point, that we should be concerned about using land in the best way possible for the betterment of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to extend congratulations to Deputy Hyland on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Because I have served on committees with Deputy Hyland over a long number of years I was particularly pleased that he was chosen by the Taoiseach to fill the ranks of the Ministers of State.  Deputy Hyland and I served on the county committees of agriculture and on the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture, ACOT, An Foras Talúntais and, more importantly, he was involved with Muintir na Tíre when that great national movement was founded by Rev. Fr. Hayes, who was Parish Priest in my native Bansha, County Tipperary. <Col N="812" /> The Minister's brief reflects the concepts that Fr. Hayes espoused for the people of the land, Muintir na Tíre.  Fr. Hayes was a missionary and he advocated that rural people should help one another at parish level and at guild or &ldquo;muintir&rdquo; level and work together for the common good of the people of Ireland.  In the light of the Minister's background I have no doubt that he will fit very comfortably into his ministry, with special responsibility for rural development.  The Minister also has experience in Europe as he was leader of the group on the Council of Europe and, therefore, he knows how Europeans think about the importance of land.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that on his first official function in the House the Minister of State has to deal with the abolition of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission had their flaws and were not perfect, indeed, on many occasions they were accused of having a political bias but, in fairness, the Land Commission have stood the test of time.  As a member of the Labour Party and as a socialist I agree with the principle of helping small farmers to better themselves and in doing so in an organised way by State intervention.  I have a special interest in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was mooted by previous Governments.  We all had our say and I had my say as a Labour Party Member of this House.  I believe that if we were to abolish that powerful body, it should only be done if a more effective and streamlined organisation was put in their place.  Land is a very precious commodity, especially in Ireland.  You cannot leave decisions about land to the discretion of the cheque book brigade, whether they are non-nationals, EC nationals or native people.  If one believes in the principle of assisting smallholders to survive in rural Ireland, they must be assisted by a co-ordinated programme operated by the State because they cannot compete in the market-place.  The Land Commission fulfilled that role in the past and they withstood the test of time.  The Land Commission withstood challenges to their constitutionality when they acquired land against the will of the owner in the interests of the common good.  Nothing could be closer to the <Col N="813" /> hearts of Social Democrats than that power which was operated for the benefit of people who tried to better themselves but could not compete in the market-place.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally, my first speech in the Seanad on 25 April 1975 was on the subject of land bonds, which were not then the popular way to compensate people for the acquisition of land.  Afterwards land bonds became extremely popular because of the increase in value.  The amount of land that comes on the open market is practically negligible, a minute percentage of the total.  Most land is transferred from father to son or acquired by inheritance.  The opportunity for young men qualified in agriculture to acquire land is very limited.  I hope this progressive Minister of State has not lost sight of a previous commitment by his party to establish a land authority, irrespective of the restrictions of European law.  One of the first constitutional requirements is that we look after our own people.  The right to private property is enshrined in the Constitution and is defended by everybody as something very special.  It is appropriate that powers should be conferred on the State or on local authorities to acquire land compulsorily to build houses for people who need them or to widen roads in the interest of safety.  What landowner will voluntarily offer land to the local authority or to the Land Commission?  There were very limited offers and, at times, there were jokes about making land available but at a price.  The acquisition of land for the common good is an admirable concept, based on agreed compensation, with an appeals procedure and an independent arbitrator to decide the true value.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the abolition of the Land Commission would be a retrograde step, particularly if there were no replacement body.  Much work was carried out on the possibility of such a replacement body.  The General Council of Agriculture Committees, before their abolition, produced the concept of a land authority.  The ICMSA and the family farm section of the IFA also brought forward proposals for some regulatory body which would control the movement <Col N="814" /> of people from land, assist them to be rehoused in better holdings, address the problem of fragmented holdings and so on.</P>
    <P>With the passing of this Bill the land of Ireland will be available in the market-place. I am worried that smaller farmers who want to improve their holdings and landless young farmers will have no opportunity to acquire land except through inheritance or by borrowing heavily. Naturally the banks and other lending agencies will offer facilites to everybody to compete in the market-place for the one farm.  This causes the market value of a holding to escalate. However, the banks quickly get tough when times are difficult and insist on payments of moneys borrowed, sometimes requiring the disposal of part of the land.</P>
    <P>I am saddened that there is no evidence of a replacement body to regulate land for the common good.  I am also concerned that much of the land acquired under the original legislation has not yet been distributed.  Vast powers were conferred by law and land was to be acquired specifically for redistribution.  I understand that land which is still held is to be handed back to the people from whom it was purchased or, worse still, it is to be offered publicly for sale to the highest bidder.  The Land Commission went beyond their brief.  They used their powers to acquire land and then made other decisions about its disposal.  I presume there are still quite decent amounts of land available which are to be handed to the Minister, to Coillte or to fishery boards.  Up to the seventies the Land Commission had acquired some 14 million acres for redistribution.  But for the Land Commission that land would never have been used to benefit people in rural Ireland.  Resettlement of farmers happened in my county.  People were moved to other parts of the county and integrated into new communities.  Their original holdings were used to assist the people left behind and to make their undertakings viable.  We inherited a system of fragmented holdings.  Absentee landlords granted holdings which were fragmented throughout a county and beyond.  There were endless arguments <Col N="815" /> about rights of way, riparian rights, water rights and rights of entry and exit.</P>
    <P>This is a sad day because there is no commitment from Government to set up another body to do some of the very useful work which was carried on by the Land Commission.  The Minister might agree that the land should be disposed of to those in need, on the basis that this is the purpose for which it was acquired. Otherwise we will have reneged on our original responsibilities.  If we sell the land we are involving the state in land trading.</P>
    <P>Thousands of farmers have to pay land annuities and some of them are experiencing extreme difficulty due to milk quota restrictions, the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and so on. Things will never be the same again in agriculture, particularly for small farmers. People are paying annuities which have created a drain on their diminishing incomes.  I hope the Minister through this Bill will consider giving them an opportunity to acquire those annuities over a stated period in the same way as people in occupation of land or property had the opportunity to acquire the ground rent ownership.  Perhaps the Minister would consider in the case of annuities which are now being vested in the Minister or in the courts that land owners would be given the opportunity over an agreed and specified period to acquire total ownership of the annuities, particularly if they are annuities which have an extended period of life.  People have picketed this House recently on the basis that annuities for Land Commission land have now escalated beyond their ability to repay.</P>
    <P>We must remember also that parts of Europe are progressively developing factory type farming &mdash; for example, in Holland land cannot be bought for any price. People who look at the study wind patterns map of Europe and study wind patterns have identified in Ireland the last bastion in Europe least likely to be affected by acid rain.  People from Holland are now coming to Ireland to acquire land, particularly land for special farming, farming not affected by fertilisers, acid rain and so on.  Even in my constituency there is effective farming in that category, <Col N="816" /> which is probably the way in which many more Irish farmers should be proceeding. Because of the very special position of Ireland and the European view of ours as a green country &mdash; a land that is green, pure and unpolluted &mdash; people are more likely to turn their attention to the acquisition of land here.  Under the Treaty of Rome European nationals have a right of access to land, services and so on in any member state.  They will be able to come in and compete with Irish people under common European law.  This will put small Irish farmers, and particularly young Irish farmers, at a tremendous financial disadvantage because of their inability to compete with the amount of capital available to efficient Dutch and other farmers for specialised farming &mdash; something we have begun to turn to, but not to the extent the Minister would wish. There will be more demand for Irish land, but unfortunately that demand will not be from Irish people.  I know we are on the periphery of Europe but we cannot claim any privileges in regard to the rights of EC nationals.  I hope that, as a result of my pleadings and those of other Members of this House, the Government would consider some regulatory authority to take account of this dilemma, especially in regard to the social dimension, where the Land Commission played such an effective role.</P>
    <P>Funding is available from Europe through the Structural Funds.  The Leader programme, which I hope will be within the Minister's jurisdiction, will give local communities an opportunity to develop their areas in a co-ordinated way.  Spectacular amounts of money are available through the Leader programme. I hope Muintir will be considered as expert in the area of operating the Leader programme in their districts because they have branches in most rural areas.  I hope the Leader programme can be used to ensure that Irish agricultural development continues, especially in the areas of alternative farming enterprises in tourism and in many other ways and that Bord Fáilte will be promoting and supporting the programme to ensure viable income for people who stay on the land.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the provision in <Col N="817" /> the Bill whereby the lay commissioners will be taken care of.  There is a tremendous pool of expertise in the Land Commission which has been slowly run down from the time of the publication of this Bill six or seven years ago.  No land has been acquired, but these experts have been beavering away trying to divide and sublet land.  I hope that those people will not be coaxed out by redundancy compensation payments because, with the restriction on recruitment, their expertise could never be replaced.  Whole areas are being denuded of advisory staff with agricultural expertise &mdash; expertise which in the past was given independently to farmers with no vested interest from co-ops or any other agency. That was one of the benefits of ACOT and, until recently, of the Teagasc service. I have expressed regret publicly about this.  In my constituency, I have condemned the present chairman of Teagasc, someone who has achieved the top status in farming, for allowing the dissolution of Teagasc, a body we had all been involved in setting up.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Hogan is in the House. I recall the contribution of his late father to the General Council of Agricultural Committees.  He was chairman of that robust body in the days when farmers and those with an interest in agriculture developed the whole concept of agricultural advice and training for young people.  That is being eroded every day in every constituency for the sake of financial rectitude.  I would hate to see our expert lay commissioners lost to an area which will need every assistance in the future to survive in farming and in alternative farming enterprises.</P>
    <P>There are people who are drawing up plans and proposals for alternative farming through the horse breeding industry in riding schools and in other areas to which land lends itself.  An EC regulation specifies that no grants are available if the foundation work is started without prior approval, even with planning permission. We should look at the areas where people are trying desperately to find an alternative to the production of milk or beef and give them every assistance. We should not allow restrictions imposed by Eurocrats on the basis that <Col N="818" /> this is probably good for planning and development.  I know the people in our rural areas.  They do not make too many mistakes.  The fact that they may have a contractor available to lay the foundations should not debar them from grants which will assist them in the area of alternative enterprises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred briefly to large mountain tracts which form the natural habitat for wildlife &mdash; what he said was quite true &mdash; but there are also large mountain tracts where sheep have been grazed for as long as anyone in any parish can remember, going back hundreds of years.  Even though the land is in private ownership, people have grazing rights.  I am talking here about parts of the Galtee Mountains which stretch from Cahir through Cappauniac, Rossadrehid, Glencushabainne and Lyre, which are difficult to pronounce and spell but support rural people who are quite happy to live there.  They may only come down the the mountain once a week to go to Mass, but they certainly come down to vote. They should be considered as happy people.  If they are left with a source of income they will be content and happy and will make few demands on the State. They rear tremendous families who take their place in every facet of Irish life.</P>
    <P>Those people live four or more miles into the Galtee Mountains.  It was only during the past ten years that the scheme of rural electrification was extended to them.  They have reclaimed land on the mountain.  Those people do not want hand-outs from the European Commmunity; they want to be happy producing a product and should be assisted in doing so.</P>
    <P>They have grazing rights on land which was originally owned by landlords in the time of the White Boys.  Those with grazing rights own many sheep.  I understand that when this land was put up for sale only part of it was acquired by the Forestry Division and by Coillte Teo because the remainder was considered to be mountain land.  Needless to say, these small mountain farmers, or highland farmers, who form the backbone of rural <Col N="819" /> Ireland, could not afford to buy it.  I requested the Land Commission to purchase this land to regularise the position but they showed no interest.  That is a pity because they could have acquired and redistributed it.</P>
    <P>Some of the land is in public ownership and the remainder, I understand, is now owned by a person who lives in England. These mountain farmers have defended their grazing rights which they and their grandfathers have had.  A nominal sum was paid to the original landowners in respect of the grazing rights.  I understand it was of the order of one shilling per sheep and that it was not collectible if there was snow in the month of May. This was legally binding as were many other traditions.  Eventually, the landlord came to the conclusion it was not worth collecting this nominal sum and decided to sell the property.</P>
    <P>When the new English owner acquired the property he discovered all these sheep belonging to the mountain farmers who have squatter's rights.  I ask the Minister to consider the request I made to his Department to acquire that section of the Galtee Mountains which is owned by someone in England but in respect of which these mountain farmers have squatter's rights.  He should see if there is any way the position can be regularised and the matter clarified in relation to title.  I should make the point that the Department gave grants in an effort to help these mountain farmers fence off land even though they did not hold title.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to consider the possibility of establishing an alternative body who at some stage in the future might have the political courage to become involved in the redistribution of land for the benefit of small holders and young farmers in particular.  In abolishing the Land Commission we are also removing the power to acquire land with the exception of bartering and swapping. As we are aware, people bartered and swapped long before money was invented.  It is a pity the new Minister for Finance, who is a young person, will not allow his Department have anything to <Col N="820" /> do with swapping and exchanging.  I should have thought he would have shown more ingenuity in regard to the buying and distribution of land.  I ask the Minister to consider this possibility.</P>
    <P>Given the changes that will inevitably be made within the European Community in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy, GATT and the Maastricht Treaty I ask the Minister to ensure there will be an agency responsible for this.  The Government cannot forget the important role carried out by this body, even if things have changed in Europe.  I hope a progressive attitude will be adopted in regard to the regulatory role in the purchase and distribution of land given that the weakest sections of the community, small and young farmers, are unable to compete in the marketplace with those who have financial expertise in the European Community.</P>
    <P>I am aware that stud farms acquired by people from the Middle East have been refurbished and restructured.  These stud farms had begun to deteriorate because there was no capital available to restructure them properly.  I have no problem with this development because it is of benefit to the local area and the economy in general in relation to employment and exports.  However, I am anxious about tracts of land in rural areas which would only be of benefit to small farmers to extend their holdings being subject to the marketplace, the hammer and cheque book.  That would be a retrograde step in a nation where there has always been the power to intervene in the area of housing, to house poor people and the power to acquire land to widen roads, for redistribution to increase the size of holdings and to facilitate the resettlement of farm families.  That policy has been successful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy said he does not like to look back but I think we can be proud of what has happened and of what we have managed to achieve.  I hope we can look forward to a commitment from the Government to the suggestion that they should intervene in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate the new Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="821" /> Hyland, on his appointment.  It has been acknowledged on all sides of the House that he is a gentleman.  I have no hesitation in saying he will be an excellent Minister of State and will facilitate everyone, irrespective of politics, because that is the kind of person he is.  I am delighted that someone of his considerable experience in political life has been recognised in this way.</P>
      <P>It would be fair to say that in the course of Irish history nothing has stirred the emotions, caused as much passion, excitement or, indeed, human feeling as the issue of the ownership of land.  That is not because the Irish people have a greater fascination with land than anybody else but rather because their land was taken from them for so long.  The Land Commission demonstrated, in a functional way, more than any other State agency the republican ethos of the country.  Although the Land Commission was founded prior to the foundation of the State nonetheless it heralded a change in Irish life which was brought about during the following 40 years or so.</P>
      <P>The Irish Land Commission, in a very real way, expressed the hopes and dreams of a young Ireland.  Their achievement in giving back to the people what was their is a singular one.  The question was posed this morning whether the Irish Land Commission were a failure. They were certainly not a failure in what they did.  Their job was to distribute the land in an even-handed manner and they were quite successful in this regard. Whether rural Ireland is as well off today as their aspirations meant it to be is very questionable.  However, the Irish Land Commission should not be blamed if rural life is not as it might be.  If depopulation along the west, south-west and north-west is the position today &mdash; as it certainly is &mdash; then the Irish Land Commission should not be blamed.  If you tear up the railway lines to the west, south-west and north-west of the country, fail to provide the infrastructure which is in place in the east and ignore the plight of those who are forced to flee from the land because of falling incomes, of course there will be depopulation and a disparity in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> The division of east and west since the foundation of the State becomes more pronounced with each passing year and the measures to address the problem have never been implemented by any Government.  The time has come, in the context of a new Europe, to address the problem or to accept that we will not have parity or equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme is the first real initiative in respect of garnering imagination or innovation to assist the south, west and north-west.  I strongly believe that the Leader programme should have been confined to the areas which are, without a shadow of doubt, on an unequal footing with the east coast.  If the Leader programme fails I strongly believe that depopulation in the west, south-west and north-west will continue, which would be a shame.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious position in relation to commonages.  The days of commonages are outmoded and it is time, from the point of view of animal hygiene and in fairness to the farmers involved, that they should be divided.  I think it was under one of the Acts in the thirties that the Irish Land Commission were given the power to compulsorily divide commonages. I understand that a legal question has been raised in regard to the constitutionality of that power.  I strongly urge the Minister to bring about a situation where one farmer would not be allowed to prevent five or six others dividing the commonage to make some kind of reasonable living for themselves and their families.  What is happening in regard to certain mountain commonages has a very serious environmental impact; there is considerable over-grazing on some mountain commonages which is causing worry not only in regard to the fairminded farmers who do not overgraze but in regard to the environmental hazard which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's speech it is proposed that the Land Commission's fishery rights would be transferred to the Central Fisheries Board.  I wish to sound a serious note of caution in relation to the manner in which fishery rights &mdash; and their ownership &mdash; are progressing.  Too many of our finest fishery rights are in the hands of large, very often foreign, <Col N="823" /> companies or individauls with a consequential downstream effect because they are being kept for the use of exclusive clubs and people.  They are not being used for the benefit of all the people. These fisheries have become exclusive domains and a public policy must now address the problem.</P>
    <P>If we are to seriously consider growth in tourism it is of crucial importance that our natural resources are made available to those who visit the country and indeed to our own nationals.  To be historical, there was enough trouble in the past &mdash; and many people died &mdash; so that our fisheries and lands were free and it is just and right now that our people should utilise those natural resources and preserve them for future generations.  Our people should also have the right to decide who will utilise these resources.  It is not acceptable that a few chosen individuals or companies can tie up &mdash; by buying up &mdash; some of our finest fisheries.  I strongly believe that any person with freedom in his heart and fair play and justice on his mind would say that this has to be stopped now.  In talking about rural development, I ask the Minister to keep a very close eye on our resources to ensure that there can never be a question of them getting into the hands of a few.</P>
    <P>A recent Habitat Directive by the European Community established a landmark in the history of Europe.  It provides that member states must buy, in so far as they can, areas of special interest which would, for example, be important in relation to wildlife, fauna and flora.  It is a recognition, if ever there was one, by the European Community that the development of Europe has become so commercialised and indeed modernised that there is a danger to the natural environment. Ireland, of all the European states, is unique in this regard and can boast without a shadow of a doubt of the finest examples of wildlife, fauna and flora.  However, we need to be extremely careful and vigilant about tourists who shoot wildlife indiscriminately in our bog-lands, moorlands and mountains.  Too many countries in Europe and throughout the world have learned to their cost that when they lose their wildlife it is <Col N="824" /> extremely difficult to get them back again.  It would be a great shame if we were to allow these people to interfere in any way with our wildlife.  I hope amending legislation to the Wildlife Act will be introduced as soon as possible to ensure that the risk to our wildlife and natural heritage is minimised as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I again wish the Minister well during his tenure of office.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this historic debate.</P>

      <P>I sincerely congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.  Like Deputy O'Donoghue, I do not know of anyone who is better able to carry that mantle.  I hope the Minister will be given enough latitude in Agriculture House to do the things he wants to do.</P>
      <P>I view the dissolution of the Land Commission with a certain element of regret.  I spent four and a half years in Agriculture House and, as many people will testify, I had a great personal interest in this matter.  I put a great deal of effort into the land question without, I have to acknowledge, achieving any great results.  It is true to say that many of the schemes I thought would be of benefit to rural Ireland were not implemented for a variety of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I do not think there is much to be gained from harping on what the Land Commission did and did not do.  This is an historic occasion because no other State institution was as important to so many people for so long as the Land Commission.  Even though the Land Commission are now deemed to have outlived their usefulness, like <Col N="825" /> other rural Deputies, I know what the Land Commission meant to people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>About two months ago I attended a ceremony at Creggs on the Galway-Roscommon border to mark the last speech given by Charles Stewart Parnell one hundred years previously, a few days before he died.  Charles Stewart Parnell, Michael Davitt and others lit the torch for the establishment of a body such as the Land Commission.  First there was the congested districts board, which was eventually replaced by the Land Commission. We should never forget the history of the Land Commission and how much they meant to people.</P>
    <P>I do not think I will be wasting the time of the House if I refer to a story told to me by my grandmother which is very relevant today.  My grandmother was in Creggs the day Charles Stewart Parnell gave his speech.  I remember as a young lad asking her what she thought of his speech.  Like many other thousands of peasants, as they were, her family were very poor &mdash; they had only four or five acres of land and lived in a hovel which had only one window and one door.  The only part of his speech which she remembered &mdash; there was no amplification and in any event she may not have understood what he was saying &mdash; was his statement that wealth should be redistributed and Irish people should be given the opportunity to reclaim land which had been taken off them many generations previously. When she was travelling home from the meeting with her neighbours she remembered saying that she did not believe this would ever happen.</P>
    <P>My grandmother's family were given a new two storey house, which would now be regarded as a hovel, and 27 acres of land.  She told me that the first day they moved into the house she looked out the gable window and prayed to the Blessed Virgin that the day would come when they would have enough stock to fill that large farm.  The history of the Land Commission goes back to those times.  Like most people, I am not ashamed of this. However, times change and massive changes have taken place in Europe and Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> I believe we will be making a monumental mistake if we do not replace the Land Commission &mdash; I have no problem with their dissolution &mdash; with another land authority.  There is as much a need now for an overall land authority as there was at the time the Land Commission were set up.  In fact, there is more of a need for a land authority now in a different way than there was over the past 50 or 60 years.  The Land Commission were given overriding acquisition powers &mdash; they could literally acquire the land at your doorstep.  If we were to go back to the courts with similar legislation now I have no doubt that it would be deemed to be unconstitutional.  Taken together with the method of payment, land bonds, this was daylight robbery.  However, like last year's snow, that system of payment has been done away with.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a high dependency on agriculture. Fourteen per cent of the population are actively involved in agriculture and many other people depend on this industry.  Obviously we have different demands and considerations from a country like, for example, England where only 2 per cent or 3 per cent of the population are involved in agriculture.  It used to be said that land matters were of interest to farmers and their families only.  I believe that in the future the decisions made in regard to land in this country, 15 million or 16 million acres, will impinge on the lifestyles of everyone.  I should like to think that whatever proposals are put forward in the future will take this into account.</P>
    <P>We need a new land authority.  Perhaps they should have a different name as they will have to deal with many more items of a much broader nature than anything the Land Commission ever had to deal with during their lifetime.  I want to give a few examples.  It is now accepted by all and sundry that there will be no huge increase in the production of commodities. A ceiling has been placed on their production.  For the foreseeable future quotas will apply to milk production and there will be a limit to the number of sheep and cattle that may be reared.  That is as far as we can go in that area, but there are many other areas we can concentrate on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> There is a new phenomenon in rural Ireland whereby trees are planted in many areas.  That is a matter of land usage.  Obviously you cannot plant trees on O'Connell Street; they must be planted on land.  Tree planting is a new dimension to rural life in Ireland.  This matter has been discussed at length over the last couple of years and the question has been asked whether people should be allowed to plant trees wherever they want.  In the beginning there was no problem because trees were considered as a worth-while resource and it made great sense, as it still does, to plant much of the lands with trees.  Overall it is a good project, but at the end of the day there may be more trees than are needed.  We are now arriving at a stage where for some people there may be only one way to look in 20 years time, that is towards the sky, because they will be surrounded by trees. This is a matter for a land authority. Obviously the Government may give a direction in the matter but the expertise that existed in the Land Commission should be called on to help deal with it. At present it is the responsibility of the Department of Energy, but in many cases too many Departments are involved in these matters with no Department having overall responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned the whole question of wildlife.  There are areas of this country that should be used as golf courses, shooting areas and so on, but at the same time we want to ensure that people who live in those areas have certain rights.  What is needed is a balance and I was long enough in Kildare Street to know that it is very difficult to get the balance right.  There will be great tension among all the warring factions but that is no reason for not going through with projects.  I had hoped that an all-party interdepartmental committee would be set up to oversee this matter.  I will mention later five or six other items with which they could also deal.</P>
    <P>There is also a European dimension to this matter.  There are about 15 million acres of land in Ireland and we should concentrate on how best this land can be used for our people.  I have no doubt that leisure activities will play a much greater <Col N="828" /> role in people's lives in the future, and anybody who spends time in Europe will realise that.  Over the last 20 or 30 years there were occasions when there was a great shortage of office space and housing space in Dublin and it appeared that the right thing to do would be to build on half of the Phoenix Park.  If that had been done it would have alleviated certain problems at the time, but it would have been a disaster for the people of Dublin and of Ireland.  There are many parks throughout Ireland, and there is nobody better equipped to take initiatives in this area than the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned the work of the old Land Commission.  If an inter-departmental committee were set up all interested parties could be invited to give their views.  It will always be the view of people in Agriculture House that if vested interests are consulted we will get nowhere, but I believe we will get nowhere if we do not consult them.  I see no reason the expertise of farming organisations, cultural and sporting organisations and others cannot be called on to devise a strategy for the future so that projects can be initiated throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Department of Energy have responsibility for areas of scientific interest.  Some time ago a court case found that the Department interpreted some rules in an unconstitutional manner.  This is a question for the whole country but particularly for Country Galway.  Recently, in the greater Connemara area a restriction was placed, without notice to the landholders, under the ASI heading.  At the stoke of a pen, without notification to the landholders, the property was devalued.  Obviously the courts did not accept that.  When considering the establishment of a land authority all these matters must be taken into account.  Of course, there are areas in the country which should be designated as ASI areas but not at a cost to the people who own the land.  Similarly, with environmentally sensitive areas in which the Department are involved, it is very important that basic reasons are given for certain areas being chosen for certain projects.  There should be some rationale in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> I want to refer to some functions of the Land Commission which should be continued.  I do not envisage a return to the purchase of land under the system as it existed previously.  I have been a critic of that system for many years.  The system whereby land was acquired under the Land Commission, held for up to six years, as was normally the case, and then redistributed was of no value to the Exchequer.  The former landowner was paid in land bonds which was of little use to him and, by the time the land was allocated to the next farmer, it had become so poor that, particularly in latter years, some farmers would have been better off if they had never got it.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Department in the last four or five years have dropped the group purchase system which I introduced.  That system worked extraordinarily well in the years 1985 and 1986.  I have always believed that there is a collective opportunity, as in the co-operative movement, for small farmers to do something that they would be unable to do individually.  The model was taken from the old Land Commission but without the powers of that body.  In brief, the local Land Commission inspector would act as an honest broker.  People who displayed an interest in a farm coming up for sale would go to the local inspector and say that five or six of them wanted to purchase the farm jointly and needed someone they could trust, an honest broker, to divide the land among them in relation to the amount of money each was able to invest.  I again draw attention to an issue to which I referred two and a half years ago, and I am sure that Deputy Kitt, who is on the other side of the House, will also remember this case.  A farm of 300 acres came up for sale in Eyrecourt.  Local people called together a few meetings at which emotions ran high and at which, quite rightly, people said that they were not able to buy the land and asked whether the Land Commission would acquire it.  I said that that would not happen because it was not the best procedure to follow.  Instead, I suggested that the Government would set up the model.  Within two months 14 local <Col N="830" /> farmers had the 300 acres bought and registered in their names.</P>
    <P>I admit that one of the reasons the scheme did not work was that for a while Land Commission inspectors were asked to go out and work on the land tax issue, which meant that there was no one in the offices to do the work.  Following that trying time and following the repeal of the legislation, I am bitterly disappointed that none of the Minister's predecessors has seen fit to implement such a scheme. Perhaps that is a minor point but is an extremely important one in the small farming areas.  The establisment of such a scheme would give neighbours a chance to purchase an additional nine or ten acres without the State incurring any cost.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I introduced into the Dáil legislation for long-term land leasing. There were great expectations of that legislation but, for a variety of reasons, it ran into trouble as a result of the downturn in agricultural income. However, there is always great space for long-term leasing, particularly in the good farming areas where there are fairly large farms and a farmer has one or two sons involved in agricultural work.</P>
    <P>Bogs and commonages in poorer land areas are now written off.  Having read the Minister's speech, I have to come to the conclusion that no one has thought of that matter.  Although it is stated that that will be a function of the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Minister should not be misled about the position: it would take three months for a person to hunt down a Land Commission staff member because there are so few of them around; they are not allowed to travel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are a rare species, indeed.  I cannot see people being recruited through the Civil Service for that work.  Is it possible that that function could be transferred, still within the Department of Agriculture and Food, to the farm development service, who operate in every county?  That idea should be <Col N="831" /> explored because of the opportunity it offers, particularly to those from poorer land areas.  There needs to be an agricultural inspector in each farm development service office to carry out that responsibility.  At least there would be someone to whom farmers could explain their problems and from whom they could receive advice.</P>
      <P>I am long enough in the tooth to know that once there has been a change in direction it will not be possible for farmers to receive the same kind of service they got from Land Commission inspectors. It is a personal opinion of mine &mdash; one that I am sure is not shared by too many Members on either side of the House &mdash; that when a group of farmers want to divide an area of commonage they should be asked to employ the services of an engineer to draw up a plan for its division.  The usual programme for the division of commonage has in the past been for such a group of people to make contact with the local Land Commission inspectors, who would go to interview those concerned to try to reach agreement on division and, when agreement was reached, the commission would call in engineers with the necessary technical expertise to draw up a plan.  That system will exist no more.  I see no reason at all a group of farmers should not be asked to employ their own engineer in the some way as would be done when applying for planning permission.  Farmers will not like me saying that but I make the point because I know that the commissioners will not be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem arises as to what the engineer will do with the map of division. At the moment the engineer would have nowhere to take the map.  Speaking practically and taking into account the powers of the Department of Agriculture and Food, I wonder why the responsibility for organisation should not be given to one member of the farm development service.  There should be someone to take that responsibility, and one would not need to have spent a few years at Harvard University before taking it on.  The provision <Col N="832" /> of such a service would be welcomed by many.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue made a technical point about the lack of legislation providing for the instance when a selfish shareholder in a commonage refuses to row in with the majority of shareholders. That problem has been put to the test and in my view there is now no problem with the legislation.  The decision in a court case in Mayo last year in that regard was very definitive.  If one or two participants in a commonage of eight or nine decide to object, the law calls on the Department of Agriculture and Food to divide up the commonage, inclusive of those who refuse to join in, giving the objectors the chance to appeal to an ordinary court.  I believe that that measure meets the requirements.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is a breakdown in the actual delivery of service.  That is why I suggested that the Minister give the farm development service a chance to carry out that function.  My proposal would not add much extra cost to the Exchequer and it would provide a service.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an overall land authority at some stage, then I should like the Minister to state specifically whether he personally is in favour of a new authority, one that could not and should not have the same functions is the old Land Commission. Times have changed and it would be most inappropriate now to have an authority that was anything like the old Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Surely there must be some control on foreigners.  I know that the officials would say that there is such control.  It is true that the control is there on paper but it does not manifest itself on the ground.  I am experienced enough to know that all that is needed by a foreigner from any country in order to purchase land is a big cheque book.  Someone might have to make an application to an office in Kildare Street for a document that would issue in three days.  The position is much the same with subdivision, but I am not arguing that issue.  I have never had a hang-up about the subdivision laws as such.  In the light of the laws that apply <Col N="833" /> to Irish nationals when they go to other countries, there should be conditions imposed on foreigners wishing to purchase land here.  I do not say that in the interests of keeping people out, which would be anti-European and against the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  However, it would be reasonable to require such people to have at least the same educational standards in agriculture that we ask of many of our young people applying for grants.  People who possess the required qualifications would be as much entitled to buy land here as I should be entitled to buy land in Portugal or Denmark, for example.</P>
    <P>If and when the Minister decides on some overall body for land usage he should ensure that all sectors of the community are involved, even people having no connection with farming.  That 15 million acres is for the benefit of the people. Of course we want to keep the maximum number of families farming on the land. That must be a priority as far as is possible, but we must be able to ensure that something like the amenity of the Phoenix Park, for instance, will be left and other such spaces will be created throughout the country for people who do not live on farms, who have no interest in farming but who wish to live in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's winding up speech because what was said in his opening speech was inadequate.  It appears that the people in Agriculture House who always believed that there should not be any regulatory body are winning.  That is not good.  The Minister and the Minister of State in the interests of all the people, before this debate is over, should give us some indication of what they genuinely believe about such a body.  I wish the Minister of State well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating Deputy Hyland on his appointment as Minister of State.  I served with him in the Council of Europe.  I hope his experience in Europe will help him in his negotiations in Europe on behalf of Irish farmers, particularly small farmers.  We are from adjoining constituencies and <Col N="834" /> would have the same interests in the whole area of agriculture.</P>
      <P>I join with the Minister in paying tribute to the staff of the Land Commission. Given that this Bill was presented in March 1989, I have been saddened by the fact that there has been very little discussion with the staff of the Land Commission about their future following the dissolution of the Land Commission. When staff from the Land Commission were redeployed to the income tax offices to carry out land evaluation for land tax purposes the Department of Agriculture would not take them back when that was abandoned.  I am amazed that there have been attempts following that to move Land Commission staff from the west of Ireland to Dublin.  That is a disgraceful proposition when the Leader programme has been introduced and when rural development programmes have been introduced.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that one of the responsibilities that has been allocated to Deputy Hyland relates to rural enterprise and development.  I would ask the Minister to take on board the fact that Land Commission staff in western areas could take responsibility for some of these programmes and in other areas.  It was suggested that county development teams would be expanded to work on rural development and that is another area where Land Commission staff expertise might be needed.  It is fair to point out that if the Minister moves even ten offices to Dublin we could be talking about moving 40 or 50 people to Dublin from the west.  There is serious concern in the west about emigration and unemployment and we are proposing to move people from the west to Dublin when these people could be used productively on other schemes in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the Land Commission built houses, provided water supplies and built roads.  When the Land Commission were first set up there was what was referred to at the time as the congestion of smallholders.  Not only had the Land Commission to build houses and provide water supplies but they had to find farms for people in other parts of the country. <Col N="835" /> That gave rise to Gaeltachtaí being set up in places like Meath when people were moved to those areas.  The roads the Land Commission built were first class and it was easy for the county councils to take them over at a later stage.  The roads were of a good quality and they are a testament to the Land Commission work at the time.</P>
    <P>I hope that commonages and bogs will be divided now.  It was totally ridiculous that one farmer could object to the division of a commonage.  I know of areas where one farmer could object to the division of two or three commonages because he would have shares in each of them.  This holds up the whole question of land allotment in western regions. Irrespective of whether or not we have a Land Commission, this question must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>With regard to land annuities, the Land Commission bought land when it was expensive but they have been too quick to ask farmers to pay high land annuities. The farmers cannot pay.  Farming has been going through a difficult time particularly over the last two years.  There must be a way out of this.  I suggest that a longer period should be given within which to pay annuities.  I know that Deputy Michael O'Kennedy as Minister set up a working party to look at individual cases because we could not legislate for people with problems paying land annuities.  At the moment many farm grants, such as cattle and sheep headage grants, are being used to pay land annuities.  In many cases the annuities are being deducted from the grants.  It is difficult for any farmer to plan ahead when he sees his grants being deducted to pay land annuities.</P>
    <P>I hope that following this Bill we can have a replacement for the Land Commission. I hope that the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and particularly Deputy Hyland, can come up with a body which will look at land use.  It is land use we have to consider now.  The concerns of the staff are also important, but I have raised that <Col N="836" /> point already.  Naturally, the staff are worried about their future.  When one considers the role the Land Commission played in the group purchase scheme, which was very successful in some areas, I wonder who will carry out the work of redistributing land when the Land Commission are dissolved.  There is a role for some organisation to deal with the commonages, bogs and land distribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Department's policy is to ensure that we retain as many viable farms as possible.  Indeed, it is part of the constitution of the Fianna Fáil Party that we have as many farm families on the land as possible.  As the Minister said, we will have to look very carefully at the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which will affect small farmers in particular.  I have said at public meetings and I repeat in this House that our Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Ray MacSharry is going in the right direction in trying to protect the small farmers.  I have been criticised for saying this at some meetings.  Certainly changes will have to be made, particularly in the number of livestock units per hectare.  The commissioner is going in the right direction to protect the smaller farmers.  We must ensure, however, that subsidies, headage, and grants payments are made on time.  I cannot understand why we cannot arrange to have payments made on two or three set dates in the year.  It is ridiculous that a farmer on one side of the road can get his grant payment today but the farmer on the other side of the road has to wait for two or three months for his payments.  I would like to see the bureaucracy eliminated.</P>
    <P>Approximately ten years ago there were similar problems with the payment of social welfare cheques but after decentralisation the Department of Social Welfare pay the recipients of different schemes from different offices.  For example, pensions are paid from the Sligo office and the children's allowances are paid from Letterkenny.  Surely, some similar arrangement could be made in the Department of Agriculture and Food because the Department administer only three schemes, headage, suckler cow and <Col N="837" /> beef premium payments.  The Department could arrange for the payments to be made from different centres and the farmers should receive their payments on set dates throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to admit that the Land Commission made mistakes.  Perhaps it was Government policy that was responsible for the mistakes they made. For example, the land bonds were a disaster and people lost out in a big way on their introduction.  However, the Land Commission played a very import-and role particularly in the 12 western counties where farmers could buy out their land at half the market value.  That scheme has been done away with.  Under section 50 of the Land Act, 1931, a farmer could buy out the land if he or she paid one-third of the instalment in a once-off payment on top of the fixed payment for the land.  I would like to see a similar provision in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Tribute must be paid to the Land Commission for the social role they played in rural Ireland.  It may be only a small thing but they provided playing pitches for various sporting organisations.  Many GAA, soccer and rugby clubs that I know of got the land for their playing pitches from the Land Commission.  They were then able to provide other facilities.  The starting point in many parishes in the west was to get the land for sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>May I congratulate Deputy Hyland on his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for rural development.  He has a very important role as far as the western Deputies are concerned.  Even though we are abolishing the Land Commission I hope we will not forget the great work they did.  I hope we will see alternative uses of land, as this is the most important issue facing our farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in extending every good wish to Deputy Hyland on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food.  As a near neighbour of mine in Kilkenny.  I can say that his commitment to agriculture and his involvement in the agricultural industry over the <Col N="838" /> years will be of great benefit when he is putting together the appropriate policies to ensure a brighter future for the troubled agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission Bill introduced in 1989 resulted in the dissolution of the Dáil.  I hope that history will not repeat itself on this occasion.  The efforts that have been made to dissolve this historic body have been many and varied and go back to 1984.  However, I expect we will succeed on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The system of land tenure prevailing in Ireland is almost exclusively owner-occupancy. This system evolved between 1870 and 1923 from an unsuccessful landlord-tenant system which had been imposed on the country by British conquest between the mid-16th and mid-17th centuries.  Unfortunately, the need for land reform in Ireland is as critical now as it was in 1870.  It was in that context that the Land Commission were established as a State agency that would bring about agricultural viability and at the same time introduce new entrants to agriculture, a plantation method.  It became an extension of the work that had been carried out by the Congested Districts Boards in the 19th century.</P>
      <P>The total agricultural area in Ireland which can be utilised is around 5.7 million hectares.  One might think that this is a tremendous amount of land to cater for the small island of Ireland but everybody knows there are great structural problems varying from one region to another.</P>
      <P>Land is unique in that it is fixed in location and limited in supply.  Consequently the relationship between man and land is central to the structure of rural society.  Therefore the rational allocation of land between the competing demands made on it by society is both a delicate and complicated matter.  The records of our courts will show that there have been more internal and external family disputes relating to the ownership or otherwise of lands than any other issue before the courts.  Land is such a delicate issue that it conjures up the potential for friction in communities that is unlikely to be surpassed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> However, because of our unique dependency on agriculture it is undoubtedly in the interests of both the agricultural sector and the national economy to have the maximum amount of land utilised to produce value-added products in spite of surplus production in the European Community generally.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the present structure of farming in Ireland it is obvious that there are major obstacles to achieving maximum utilisation.  The census of population in 1986 shows 22,111 farmers aged 65 years and over.  In addition there has been a trend towards part-time farming and the removal of marginal land from active use which has been accelerated in recent times by a reduction in product price through reduction in supports from the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>The facts, coupled with the extent of conacre, would suggest less than full utilisation of the land in Ireland.  There is a general misconception that massive land resources are mobilised through the land market each year.  The reality is that approximately 3 per cent of land changes hands through ownership changes but by far the largest proportion of land, 84 per cent of changes in ownership, is transacted through inheritance and gifts. Accordingly, if we are to make any impact on land mobility, it will be through financial inducements in the area of inheritance which will generate the greatest impact.</P>
    <P>Various measures have been introduced by successive Governments over the years to include stamp duty exemption, relief under the capital acquisitions tax code, young farmer installation aid, farmer retirement schemes, tax incentives for long term leasing; but in spite of all of these important incentives there are many people in Ireland today who still find it difficult to relinquish the reins of ownership, and indeed more so in recent times when there is a general reluctance on the part of new entrants to agriculture to take over the reins of ownership in view of the uncertain aspects of a viable <Col N="840" /> standard of living on agricultural holdings in the future.</P>
    <P>Undoubtediy the most significant problem in agriculture is the persistence of low and volatile incomes.  It is particularly striking that this problem should remain even after a period of very strong growth in overall agricultural income. Indeed the disparities in incomes in the agricultural sector would seem to have widened since 1973, particularly because of the structural characteristics of Irish agriculture and the rural economy.  It appears that the increased output of Irish agriculture in the seventies or indeed subsequently was provided by a minority of farmers.  The remainder occupying the large proportion of agricultural land were unable for a variety of reasons to respond to the strong incentives offered by the Common Agricultural Policy.  This dichotomy in the agricultural sector has been investigated and found to coincide closely with the age, education and marital characteristics of farmers, as well as farm size and regional properties.  The persistence of low incomes and the narrow base of the progressive sector reveal the existence of very severe structural and other problems in the Irish economy.  This is stated in an NESC report into the problems of Irish agriculture <i>vis-à-vis</i> the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted throughout the European Community, and becoming more so in Ireland, that the achievement of adequate farm incomes requires the inevitable reduction in the numbers employed in that sector.  Indeed, various studies have indicated that the minimum variable size of holding for grassland production is increasing over time.  This implies that we will have more adjustment in land structures over the next decade.  One would have to say that, in spite of the activities of the Land Commission to make more farmers viable and to increase their holdings and introduce new entrants to agriculture, the underlying structure which was being preserved was one which sustained inadequate income levels in a period of relative agricultural prosperity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> It also appears that the policy since our entry to the European Community failed to induce significant change in the size and structure of agricultural holdings.  One will recall that the former Minister for Agriculture, Mark Clinton, established an interdepartmental committee on land structural reform during his term of office in the mid-seventies.  This report identified three characteristics of the Irish land tenure system which were obstacles to improved land use.  First, there was the predominance of owner occupancy; second, the strong sense of attachment to the family holding and, third, the prevalence of short term leasing.  The committee concluded that these inflexible features of our land tenure system constituted the major barriers to development of the country's agricultural industry.  The proportion of farm holdings with total incomes below the 50 per cent relative poverty line, with an income less than half the average industrial wage, almost doubled since our entry to the EC.  This is hard to believe, in spite of the net Common Agricultural Policy transfers to the economy which rose as high as over 10 per cent of GNP in the early eighties but which have been declining gradually since 1980 itself.</P>
    <P>Obviously the age profile of our farming population has been largely responsible, in addition to the structural problems of agriculture, in failing to respond to the opportunities given to the agricultural sector since 1973.  In addition there has been no national land policy to develop or re-orientate the rural economy since the mid seventies.  There has been a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to the problem of Irish agriculture so long as the net transfer of aid from the European Community continued to flow into the Irish economy. In recent years one can only conclude that the chickens have come home to roost.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the current EC philosophy on maintaining the rural society does not provide a veil on inherent structural problems in Irish agriculture.  A properly co-ordinated rural development programme is urgently required.  In particular this programme must effectively <Col N="842" /> improve the structural efficiency of agriculture.</P>
    <P>More and more of our aid is coming from the Community through various compensation payments for reduced product price.  However, thousands of farm families are undergoing tremendous financial pressure and it is cold comfort to them that there is a problem at EC level in respect of the payment of the special beef premia, suckler cow premia or other payments.  There is no source of income whatsoever coming into the family farm at this time of the year except those payments.</P>
    <P>Mansholt failed in his objective in the early seventies to destroy rural communities, but Commissioner Ray MacSharry has succeeded in one fell swoop through his proposals and through the encouragement of the Euro barometer in reducing commercial Irish agriculture to subsistence level.  He is closing down the engines of agricultural productivity and replacing them with the &ldquo;cheque in the post syndrome&rdquo;.  That appears to be the mentality and the policy which Deputy Michael Kitt would wish to make permanent in the Irish agricultural industry. I hope the new Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, who comes from a part of the country where we still depend on the weather, will actually ensure that the commercial farmer in this country will continue to have a vital role to play in agricultural productivity.</P>
    <P>The MacSharry proposals are not thought out properly.  His alternative proposals of treating farmers as hewers of wood and protectors of the environment are insufficient and no substitute for a proper land reform policy.</P>
    <P>The need for a modern and effective land policy and programme is now more urgent than at any time in the recent past. We have an ageing population and an increasing capital cost of establishing on a farm today.  It is ironic that these are the facts of life at a time when we are dissolving the Land Commission, especially when we consider the historic contribution that that body made to viable farm families and holdings throughout the country.  Production <Col N="843" /> quotas, environmental factors and the trend towards extensification all combine to increase the area of land required to generate our given level of income.</P>
    <P>The State has in the past through the Land Commission built a land policy around the notion of purchasing land and redistributing it to smallholders.  It is totally unacceptable to me to abolish the Land Commission today and fail to replace it with a new land agency to formulate and implement a new land use programme to bring about an economically sustainable and acceptable land tenure and ownership structure.</P>
    <P>We need an agency that will implement the objectives of the President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, when he stated that the general thrust of European agricultural policy would be to maximise the number of viable farm family units on the land.  Since he made that statement in County Wicklow he has unfortunately failed to back it up with properly constructed and co-ordinated policies.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years the number of farm families has fallen from 180,000 to just 90,000 full-time farmers.  On further examination of these figures it is clear that most of the reduction has taken place in the farming category under 30 acres. This has obviously major implications for the structure of rural society and the income distribution in rural areas.  More and more land is required to meet the average household income today than was required 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is now accepted that it would take at least 90 acres of good agricultural land to earn a similar income to that of the average industrial wage and your income from agriculture will be largely determined by whether you have a milk quota or not.  It is generally accepted that a 40,000 gallon milk quota on a 90 acre farm is required to have that type of income.  This is the type of huge structural change that has taken place in rural Ireland without any reference to the implications for rural society or any preconceived planning for the entire agricultural industry.  Is it any wonder then <Col N="844" /> that the various incentives I referred to earlier are not working to increase land mobility?</P>
    <P>At the same time as there is a huge reduction in farm incomes, the State continues to penalise inter-family transfers through the capital acquisitions tax code. The Minister for Finance and, indeed, the Taoiseach, fail to understand the damage that this penal taxation regime is causing to the commercial agricultural sector through the enactment of the various Finance Bills over the past couple of years.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food today to use his good offices in the preparation of the Finance Bill to amend thresholds in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 to ensure proper account is taken of the value of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The introduction of contributory pensions for farmers takes away a valuable incentive for transferring farms.  The farmer no longer needs to transfer his farm in order to qualify for a pension. Retirement schemes have failed to encourage land transfer in spite of EC Council Regulation 1096/88 which allows for a lump sum payment to a farmer who retires at age 63 or earlier and which has never been implemented in Ireland.  The young farmer installation aid scheme, a proper retirement scheme and a realistic capital acquisitions tax threshold could mean a new impetus to land mobility in Ireland which gives the farmer a specific work routine, plenty of social contact and the social standing of one who is providing for his or her family in contributing to society and job creation in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to expect that, with the downturn in agricultural activity and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, there will be an increasing amount of land coming on the open market in coming years.  Thus, it is essential that some regulatory authority be established to ensure that this land is used for agricultural purposes rather than speculative development.  It is important that full-time farmers gain access to this land rather than people from the professions who seek only to obtain the holding for <Col N="845" /> future capital gain or as a family playground. I contend that the land market between now and the end of the decade should account for most of the transfer of land rather than the amount of land that has been transferred by gift or inheritance to date.</P>
    <P>It is essential that proper safeguards and the financial framework are now put in place to assist potentially viable farmers obtain additional land.  The central thrust of any new land agency should be to reform the current land market and to increase the ability of the medium-scale farmer to compete with other land purchasers in the open market so as to bring about a more economic and socially acceptable land tenure system.  Unfortunately, reduced access to capital from the financial institutions and anomalies in the income tax code create a bias in the land market against small and medium-scale farmers.  Two very important and fundamental ingredients are essential for new entrants to viable farm holdings in relation to access to land.  First, we must have a well qualified and educated work-force in agriculture that will be able to meet the challenges and opportunities of Common Agricultural Policy reform and, second, the same income tax concessions available to persons and companies outside of agriculture should be available to people directly in the industry to finance the purchase of agricultural land to offset interest costs on borrowed capital and so on.</P>
    <P>Perhaps reform of the tax code in this way would have a moderating influence on land prices and would give an opportunity to the farming sector to purchase agricultural land thus reducing the competition from the non-farming sector.  It is unrealistic to expect any restructuring of land and essential subsequent development of the enlarged holdings in the absence of fixed repayments or income-related long term finance.</P>
    <P>The country and financial institutions have failed to devise any system of financing capital for land purchase which takes account of changing conditions over a long period.  Substantial amounts of money for long term investment can <Col N="846" /> be raised in the money markets with the backing of a State guarantee where the rate of return to the investor is 1 per cent to 2 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>The best example of this particular method was through the Housing Finance Agency established by the Government to provide more housing in 1981. That body borrowed £300 million over five years and, unfortunately, the experience has not been one of success for many borrowers.  Nevertheless, we should learn from that experience and apply this type of system of financing to land purchase.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the State has an agricultural bank at its disposal &mdash; through the ACC &mdash; to establish a similar type of agency to raise long term capital under State guarantee but it does not have the political will or the foresight in terms of long term planning to initiative such a scheme.</P>
    <P>The country has one of the highest real levels of interest rates in Europe and the financial institutions are making huge profits.  Consequently there should be a fund at fixed levels of interest which could be made available for agricultural development.  There is no consistency in the way in which security policy is implemented in the financial institutions today.  There is no consistency in the manner of economic development or agricultural development here that takes account of lending policy <i>vis-a-vis</i> the economic conditions of the day.  In good times money is literally thrown at people and in bad times banks feel they will never have the repayment made on the day on which it is due.</P>
    <P>An enlightened approach to the availability of finance for agricultural development is essential in order to ensure that the engine of agricultural activity, namely, the commercial farm is equipped to cope with the onslaught of product price reductions which Commissioner MacSharry is intent on implementing.</P>
    <P>Any new land agency should have responsibility to ensure that all land transfers are monitored and that detailed statistical information on land transfers and leases be published annually.  At <Col N="847" /> present there is a huge information gap on the question of land policy and it is difficult for any agency or Government to make decisions on land restructuring without any idea of the trends in respect of land mobility taking place at present.</P>
    <P>The attack on rural Ireland from the European Community, the reduction in direct income support from the State and the huge socio-economic changes that are taking place throughout rural Ireland should provide the necessary impetus for the Government to implement radical and planned changes in our rural development policies that will ensure viability for as many farm families as possible and retain the population of rural areas intact at a time when there are little or no opportunities outside agriculture.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to bring together the farm organisations as soon as possible to discuss a replacement of the Land Commission by establishing a new and dynamic land agency.  Another factor which makes this agency even more important is the mobility that is taking place in terms of the milk quota and the need to monitor the transfer of milk supplies from one region to another on a national basis.</P>
    <P>I commend the thinking of farm organisations like Macra na Feirme and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association on their thought-provoking and enlightened approach to the issues of land reform.  All farm organisations could make a valuable contribution towards the establishment of a dynamic land agency. In respect of this matter I was disappointed to note in the Minister's speech that he was content to leave the issue of land policy to market forces and, because of the downturn in agricultural support from the European Community, he was of the opinion there was no need for a new land agency or that any impetus be given to a land use policy.</P>
    <P>Legislation was enacted recently by the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of land bonds.  This has given an opportunity to the Minister for Agriculture and Food to review the land annuities paid <Col N="848" /> by farmers for lands acquired by these farmers from the Land Commission over the years.  The problem of many farmers in meeting their bi-annual payments to the Land Commission is now a cause of serious concern.  It is estimated that there are approximately 6,000 farmers with serious arrears problems with the Land Commission.  The question of withholding various premium payments from the Department of Agriculture and Food and, indeed, the fact that some cases have been dealt with through the sheriff has highlighted the escalating problem with these repayments.</P>
    <P>Many of the farmers have had to resort to applying for social welfare but many are deemed ineligible as they cannot claim the annuity as a legitimate expense. The problem of high annuity occurred mainly in the period 1978 to 1982 when a combination of high interest rates and high prices led to a very high payment being arrived at.  Many of the farmers who got land at that time would have been better off if they had never got it in view of the millstone they have put around their necks.  The highest interest rate payment was 18.25 per cent and in some instances the payment per acre was as high as £180 per annum.  This problem has been compounded by the reduction in farm produce prices and the introduction of milk quotas.</P>
    <P>The outlook for many of our farmers is bleak.  It is estimated by the Irish Farmers Association that arrears owing to the Land Commission are of the order of £5.4 million and that these arrears will rise significantly in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Radical measures are now required to alleviate the problem and I am glad the Minister for Agriculture and Food has set up a working group to examine the issue.  In view of the fact that the Minister is now abolishing the Land Commission and that he has vested himself with powers under the Land Bond Act, 1991, this is an opportunity for the State to dispose of all properties, through a tenant purchase scheme at a knock-down price. The precedent for such a scheme is well known to the Department of the Environment. The State, under a generous <Col N="849" /> buy-out scheme, gave tenants the opportunity to become owner-occupiers.</P>
    <P>People with holdings, which were acquired from the Land Commission, and who made their repayments on time, should be considered in drawing up any scheme in the future.</P>
    <P>I know of many farmers who bought their properties from the Land Commission using funds borrowed from financial institutions.  Should consideration be given to holders of property presently vested in the Land Commission similar consideration should also be given to farmers who have paid on time and have worked with great difficulty to meet their financial commitments.  It would be very unfair if farmers who have paid their way and have borrowed money at high rates were not given concessions or did not receive consideration while those who have not been in a position to make their land annuity repayments were the only ones to receive consideration under a potential land buy-out scheme.  Indeed it would be grossly unfair if farmers who are in arrears, through no fault of their own, were the only ones to receive consideration. I hope the working group established in the Department of Agriculture and Food will take this into account.</P>
    <P>In October 1984, the Government announced that it was their intention to abolish the Land Commission.  Eleven estate officers were informed, through their trade unions, that it was proposed to transfer them from the Department of Agriculture and Food to the Department of Social Welfare, on a temporary basis. The functions of the estate officers it was proposed to redeploy were the rearrangement of land, commonage division, group purchase, the letting of lands, the collection of Land Commission annuity arrears and so on.  It was proposed that they be redeployed to the Department of Social Welfare as investigation officers they would be involved in checking on recipients of unemployment benefit and so on.  However, there was no negotiation with the estate officers at that time and they were not transferred or redeployed <Col N="850" /> because the social welfare officers' union objected.</P>
    <P>In 1987, the estate officers were transferred to work in various district court offices around the country, effectively as clerical officers.  This represented a unilateral alteration of their terms of employment.  Again, there was no negotiation with the affected officers.  Effectively, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, were in collusion and acting <i>ultra vires</i>, without any consultation.  They were in breach of the contract of employment of the estate officers when they decided that they should be redeployed.</P>
    <P>There was added urgency to get rid of the Land Commission estate officers in 1987 because the farm tax office had been abolished and the redundant officers had to be accommodated in their former Department.  As the House is aware, the estate officers of the Land Commission operate under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Food and were appointed following an open competition held by the Civil Service Commission under the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  They were appointed under regulations made under that Act.</P>
    <P>In summary, the estate officers were deemed to be holders of posts created by an Act of Parliament.  Their conditions of service were embodied in a document entitled CS13/121/68 which was furnished to the estate officers at the time of their appointment.  The estate officers decided to instigate a judicial review of their redeployment which eventually led to a full blown High Court case.  Effectively, the estate officers deemed themselves to be in the permanent service of the Department of Agriculture and Food, that their assignment to the Department of Justice was wrong, that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food had exercised powers that were unlawful and were purporting to derogate from the applicants' original appointment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance at the time, Ray MacSharry, introduced a voluntary redundancy scheme.  A number of officers applied and were successful. <Col N="851" /> However, the High Court case continued and the outcome was that the Department of Finance were deemed to have failed to have due regard to an estate officer's reasonable expectations to continue in the Land Commission until the office was abolished by an Act of Parliament.  Today tributes have been paid to the Land Commission for the work they have carried out.  I wonder, therefore, in the light of these tributes why these estate officers were treated so harshly.</P>
    <P>On 24 July 1989 Mr. Justice O'Hanlon gave leave to the estate officers to put their case to the High Court.  Initially, the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture and Food failed to file a defence because of their incompetence in the matter.  Eventually, the Department of Finance had to settle out of court.  On 11 December 1990 a settlement was reached on the following terms: that the Minister for Finance was agreeable to the termination, with effect from 4 January 1991, of the assignment of the estate officers, who numbered 11, to court officers; to reinstate them as local officers with the Department of Agriculture and Food; the Minister was also prepared to agree to the application of many of the estate officers for the voluntary early retirement scheme, which was previously offered to them and he was prepared to re-engage some of the estate officers who had successfully applied under the scheme earlier once they repaid certain sums of money which they had received.</P>
    <P>This detailed High Court case which I have just outlined, is a measure of the incompetence of the former Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, and the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, in their dealings with the Land Commission and their treatment of staff.  It is another indication of how the Government's control of public moneys has been absolutely disgraceful. Effectively, the Ministers in question had broken every rule in the book in respect of the employment of personnel in the Department of Agriculture <Col N="852" /> and Food, in particular in the Land Commission, without any hint of remorse from the Ministers in question or the civil servants who had advised them.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Food indicated, following the reinstatement of those officers, that they were to be assigned to the offices of the Land Commission and that there were no duties which he could assign to them.  In other words, salaries have been paid to employees of the Land Commission which will run to approximately £600,000 without any duties being assigned to them.  They are effectively being paid to do nothing.</P>
    <P>I ask the Committee of Public Accounts to examine this question in detail to ensure there will not be a recurrence in the future and that proper procedures are put in place to make sure money will not be wasted in such a scandalous way in the future.  This is another indication of low standards in the public service which we are prepared to accept in this jurisdiction. In any other country the issue of resignation or redeployment of the people who made those decisions would be on the agenda, but this will not happen in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In discussing this issue, which is of rural interest, I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Government to establish immediately a rural development agency.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food should co-ordinate the activities of a new land authority and Teagasc, under the Leader programme, and initiate meaningful rural enterprise and development.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on ensuring that Deputy Hyland was put in charge of this matter and I urge him when he comes to reply to the debate to indicate that he will establish an agency who will bring together under one body all strands of rural enterprise and development and that he will co-ordinate the activities of the farm development service and Teagasc under the Leader programme to ensure that development proceeds in a co-ordinated way in rural areas.</P>
    <P>There is a great misconception about <Col N="853" /> the frustration and despair that is apparent in rural society today.  People are clutching at straws and looking for some hope for the future.  This is not just a farming problem; it affects chambers of commerce, trade unions and farm organisations who are concerned about the future prosperity and survival of rural economies.  We are all aware that when the rural hinterland is prosperous our towns and villages benefit tremendously. When the farming community make money and are going well this eventually will lead to job creation in towns and villages.  Unfortunately, I must say that the sheltered public servants of Kildare Street seem to be immune to the fact that rural society is breaking up beyond the Pale.  Hundreds of people are turning up at seminars and conferences, in places such as Ballyfin College, and want to hear messages of hope.  No amount of political rhetoric from the Government is acceptable and no amount of &ldquo;Eurospeak&rdquo; from Commissioner MacSharry will convince ordinary farmers and people in rural areas that increased Structural Funds and alternative enterprises in mushroom production, rabbit or deer farming will provide any lasting solution to the income crisis they face.</P>
    <P>A development officer should be appointed in each rural county and individual people who have good ideas should be given every possible assistance to realise their job creation potential. Particularly as a result of the proposals put forward by Commissioner MacSharry, Teagasc have a unique expertise, with their advisory staff, to initiate development programmes throughout rural communities. These people are perhaps the most experienced and best equipped to take on this innovative role.  Development officers should be in a position to visit every village and town to realise the potential of ideas and to offer leadership to rural communities to lift them out of their present difficulties.</P>
    <P>If the Government fail to initiate a radical and innovative rural development programme vast tracts of rural areas will become depopulated.  The idea that Europe can resolve our economic and <Col N="854" /> social problems will become just a theoretical pipe dream of the decision makers. It is essential that Government, at local, national and international level, respond to people's sense of despair and hopelessness in order to avoid rampant poverty and alienation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to articulate some of the views I cherish in relation to the future development of land policy.  I do not accept what the Minister of State said in his speech; indeed, I find it difficult to believe that he accepts it, because I have known him for a long time and know his commitment to agriculture and rural development. He is wrong in thinking that market forces alone will be sufficient to ensure that we continue to have a viable rural community.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that there will not be a land agency during the term of office of the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland.  I appeal to him to bring together all the potential of rural areas in one body to ensure that he heads a Department of rural enterprise which will show leadership and dynamism and bring hope to frustrated people who are looking for leadership at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of estates in the constituency of the Minister of State &mdash; and mine &mdash; which need to be divided and I know that there are plans in that regard in 1992.  Very important work was carried out by Land Commission officers in respect of rearrangement of holdings and the elimination of fragmentation.  In the village of Mooncoin in South Kilkenny there is a huge prevalence of fragmentation.  The Minister of State, with the staff of the Land Commission &mdash; those who are left &mdash; should be able to say whether progress has been made in this area to ensure that we have a more ordered farming practice and a more viable farm holding system in that part of County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish the Minister of State every success in his new portfolio.  The demise of the Land Commission following the important historic role they have performed over the years will, I hope, signal the commencement of something <Col N="855" /> more dynamic, significant and concerted for rural areas in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Hyland.  He has an enormous contribution to make. I have known him for a long time because we both entered the Seanad together in 1977.  Not only is he an astute politician, he is a caring man, and such is certainly needed in his Department.</P>
      <P>In talking about the demise of the Land Commission some of us will have mixed feelings.  They did good and bad work as far as land distribution and improvements were concerned over the years. We all know of cases where they did not seem to do the proper thing and where land was not given to those who seemed entitled to it, perhaps for the officer's own reasons.  Indeed, in latter years the Land Commission have been a total failure. They were set up over 100 years ago to deal with the problem of land rents and when they are finally dissolved they will probably be seen to have been the worst landlords of all, because the rents sought for land subdivided by them were totally beyond the means of those to whom the land had been given.  We all accept that the action taken by the previous Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, was necessary in trying to deal with the problems people ran into as a result of being granted Land Commission allotments, which were, to put it mildly, bought at totally unrealistic prices in the mid-seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future there should be development of our present resources, a role which can be played directly by the Department of Agriculture.  We must also look at the need for a mechanism which will deal with some of the existing problems in regard to land acquisition.  Since the Land Commission are now being abolished, it is fair to ask why it has taken them in some cases six or seven years to give people title documentation in regard to allotments which they received and paid for.  I had a case this week of a farmer who had been given an allotment of land <Col N="856" /> seven years ago but who still has not received the title deeds despite the fact that he paid cash for the allotment.  That cannot be justified.  When he made representations to the Land Commission on a number of occasions, he was told that the matter had been referred to Dublin and that he would receive the deeds in due course.  That is unfair.  If somebody buys a motor car they expect to receive the tax book forthwith.  The same applies to land and title deeds.  Will the Minister of State ask his officials in the Department to arrange for a speedy conclusion of all cases involving title deeds?</P>
    <P>We must also look at the future of land policy without a Land Commission or regulatory authority.  I have fears regarding development, especially in the west, in relation to land acquisition mainly for private afforestation.  It frightens me and many farmers.  Because of the enormous grants available from Europe for afforestation people who wish to remain in agriculture are not able to buy land when they are bidding against a private company. Not alone is this causing serious social problems, but it is also questionable what the value of those forests will be when they mature.  Thinnings from land which was planted 25 or 30 years ago do not even pay the cost of taking them out, never mind the damage done to roads in the process of this work. It is a matter which must be reassessed. The Minister of State has responsibility for rural development and he should carry out a full assessment of the position with regard to the acquisition of large tracts of land by private companies for their own gain to the detriment of rural society.  This is what is happening at present.  Not alone are they acquiring land which is partially suitable for forestry but they are acquiring entire farms for planting even though 50 per cent of the land is suitable for agriculture.  Local small farmers are not able to compete with them.  The Department should examine the possibility of introducing some form of assessment for all land being taken out of agricultural production and put into forestry prior to the payment of grant aid by the Department <Col N="857" /> of Energy.  The reason I say this is simple. In many cases 20 acres or 30 acres of a 60 acre farm sold for forestry is of reasonable quality and could be sold to local farmers who want to buy it but who may not have the resources to buy the entire farm.  If something is not done about this, rural society will fall asunder and farmers will be forced off the land. There is only one way farmers, especially those in the west, will stay on the land in the future, that is through expansion.  If farmers cannot get increased market prices they have to produce more to have a viable income.  We have to look seriously at this issue.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by previous speakers to people who will be displaced, so to speak, following the abolition of the Land Commission.  These people have a major role to play in the areas in which they now live as development officers and co-ordinators for the rural development programmes proposed under the recent EC initiatives.  Instead of putting these people back into offices in Dublin I ask the Minister to leave them in the areas in which they now live and use them to promote the various programmes which are coming on stream.  These people have a role to play in their areas, having lived there for 20 or 25 years and gained much knowledge of what is required.  Why should we throw out the baby with the bath water in this case?  These people have a contribution to make and there is an opening there for them.  I ask the Minister to use these people as sales persons for the proposed rural initiatives.  This function is of major importance.</P>
    <P>People talk about the difference between urban and rural areas but we should all remember that, when the farming community are doing well our small towns and villages and cities do well and when agriculture goes into recession the whole country goes into recession.  We must use every power available to us to prevent a recession in rural areas.  If farmers have money they will reinvest it in their farms and houses. This generates employment and revenue for the State.  However, if farmers do not have confidence in their industry they <Col N="858" /> will not reinvest their money.  This means there is no spin-off to the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been hanging around since 1989.  We all knew it was coming. The Land Commission need to be replaced by some mechanism which will control land distribution.  With the advent of the Single Market we will not be able to prevent an EC national from acquiring land in this country.  However, there is still a major role to be played in regard to the acquisition, division and allotment of land to farmers.  There is still an amount of commonage, especially in the west, which needs to be divided.  This is an issue which should be looked at. In cases where there is agreement by a majority of commonage holders, commonages should be divided and brought into full production.  As they say, what is everyone's business is nobody's business and commonages are everyone's business. The only question which arises in many cases is whether Jack can get three more sheep on the commonage than Joe even though their allotments are the same size.  This is the type of thing which happens.  It is time this issue was addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes to complete the sale of the remaining estates before the end of this year.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the cheque book is not used as the mechanism for these sales.  I know a small farmer who was recently prevented from acquiring land because of his lack of cash resources.  Because the Land Commission officer was making a cash sale only a large farmer was able to prevent the small farmer from acquiring ten acres of land.  This land did not matter to the large farmer but it mattered greatly to the small farmer.  It meant the difference between his ability to make his farm viable some day or his having to depend on social welfare to make up his income with no possibility of someone being able to take over his holding in the future and making it viable.  We should ensure that the criteria used in the distribution of the remaining allotments of land are the same as those used previously, <Col N="859" /> that is, those most entitled are given the allotments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it is time to put old ghosts to rest.  This Bill has been hanging around since 1989 and it is time it was completed.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the mechanisms available to him to deal with the problems being caused in rural Ireland, especially in the west and the north west, by the uncontrolled acquisition by private groups and companies &mdash; mainly funded by Irish banks &mdash; of land which has a bigger contribution to make to the economy if left in agricultural production instead of being planted.  At a time when we are all talking about quotas it is important that as much land as possible is retained for agricultural production.  Nobody can say that 100 acres of plantation is of more benefit to our economy than 100 acres of land which is farmed for agricultural purposes. It is not, and we have to accept that.  The myth has been created by well financed people in the media business that forestry is good for the west of Ireland.  This is not the case.  At present meetings are being held about the depopulation of rural Ireland, something which has been happening for the past 50 years.  It is up to us politicians to try to address the problem and ensure that farming communities are allowed to become viable by removing the mechanisms which prevent them from becoming viable at present.</P>
    <P>As I said, I welcome the Bill.  I hope the Minister and his officials will take into consideration the points I have made.  I again wish the Minister of State well during his tenure of office.  He is an able man who understands the needs of the people he represents, the people of rural Ireland.  He has an enormous contribution to make to the Department of Agriculture and Food, especially in the area of rural development, which is his primary responsibility.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been an extraordinarily long time coming before the House.  The decision to abolish the Land Commission was announced in <Col N="860" /> 1984 and all lands were to have been disposed of by 1986.  The Bill was not published until March 1989 and it has taken a further three years for it to come before the House.  One of the results of this has been the strange arrangement highlighted in the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General whereby over £1.6 million was paid out in salaries to former Land Commission staff while they were not engaged in any productive work.  This was clearly unsatisfactory. On the other hand, those who worked for the Land Commission have certain rights as public servants.  They should be entitled to transfer to other Departments under similar terms and conditions.  I note that this Bill makes no provision for the former staff and I would ask the Minister to outline in detail what exactly is the position.</P>
      <P>It is more than 100 years since the Land Commission were established.  It goes without saying that the structures and the problems of Irish agriculture have changed dramatically since then.  The Land Commission were part of Irish rural history.  They played a central role in the transfer of land from landlord to tenant and in the breaking up of old estates.  As a result the phenomenon of the tenant farmer, still quite common in many EC countries, is very rarely found in Ireland. The basic element of the social structure of Irish agriculture is the owner occupied family farm where most of the work is done by the farm family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said many times but it needs to be said again that land is our greatest natural resource.  We have an ideal climate and potentially some of the most productive land in Europe, but our agricultural methods are still quite primitive and our productivity far below the levels of that in many other European countries. We certainly have not made the best possible use of this resource.  Much Irish land is poorly farmed.  At least part of the reason for this is the structure of Irish agriculture.  Despite calls for land redistribution in the early part of the century the Land Acts essentially gave each tenant the holding already occupied and, hence, preserved the existing uneven <Col N="861" /> structure of land holdings.  Attempts by the Land Commission to improve this uneven structure since the establishment of the State have been largely ineffective. Therefore today great inequalities persist, with the bulk of farms consisting of less than 50 acres and only a small minority in excess of 100 acres.  The fact that the smaller farms are concentrated in those regions, especially in the west, where land is poorest means that farm incomes in these areas tend to be below the national average.  However, farm size and poor land are not the only reasons for low incomes; poor technical ability is a major factor.</P>
    <P>While the Land Commission have served their purpose there is still need for some sort of agency, perhaps a national land authority, to ensure that Irish society as a whole and not just those in occupation of land will get the best possible output from this natural resource.  The immediate aim should be to devise a policy to maximise usable output from our national land resource and to provide the materials for an expanded processing sector.  In the case of small farms this requires an energetic programme of consolidation of holdings in order to create new farm units capable of providing a family with a reasonable standard of living.  Research has shown that medium sized farms of this kind tend to be the most efficient.  I would appeal to the Minister to perhaps consider the idea of co-operative farming.  Taking into account the high unemployment rate, we must realise that there is no alternative employment for people who are forced off the land.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems in regard to land use is that unless a person is in a position to inherit land there is virtually no way into farming.  In a recent very good submission by Macra na Feirme, which is referred to very infrequently, they call for the establishment of a national land authority as a matter of urgency and suggest that such a land authority must have special responsibility and power for monitoring and controlling land purchase, for development and for implementing farm mobility measures <Col N="862" /> such as retirement, partnerships, leasing and young farmer installation schemes. These are very laudable suggestions but no effort was made to follow them up. Consequently there is no policy to enable people to invest in land.</P>
    <P>My experience of the Land Commission in the early eighties is that they carried out very good work, but some people got so wealthy that they could pay double the price of the agricultural value of the land.  Consequently the Land Commission had to pay the going rate, and thus holdings were not viable.  I support the plea made by previous speakers in relation to the payment of their demand annuities because people's lives have changed and they can no longer afford to pay them.  The inflationary price of land upset the whole structure of the scheme for the Land Commission and the farmers who were relying on them.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a structure which will enable those who will use the land to most effect to acquire it.  This would require the payment of adequate compensation to those who give up their land. Newly created farms could be allocated in single blocks to farmers with specific training qualifications, thus ensuring that land would be properly used.  That matter was referred to in the submission of Macra na Feirme.  There can be no return to the old Land Commission system whereby political considerations caused acquired land to be frequently allocated in tiny fragments to the farmers in a particular locality.  Options need to be considered such as long term leasing of land to young people who want to get into farming but do not have the resources to purchase land.</P>
    <P>A proper land use study should be carried out to ensure that land is used in the most effective way possible.  Areas which are most suited to traditional farming must be identified as well as those areas suited to non-traditional farming, including forestry.  One development that offers the hope of making some land available to those outside the traditional farming sector is the use of cutaway bogs. It is estimated that an area as large as County Louth will become available <Col N="863" /> between now and the end of the century. The matter was considered by an expert committee on cutaway bogs, and I read their report which was published last month.  It was reported that about 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the total area of cutaway bogs could be suitable for conversion to grassland.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in the debate to the statement made by the Minister that there is no longer any pressure for an initiative in land policy and that it seems to be generally accepted that, given the range and scale of the structural aid now available, land mobility could be left to market forces.  I ask the Minister to take on board the points already made about that by two previous speakers. There must be a policy and there must be an urgency in the provision of that policy.  We must keep as many people on the land as we possibly can and there must be a system to accommodate those who are involved and who want to utilise the potential existing under programmes such as the Leader programme.  I call on the Minister to set up structures to ensure that local groups will be involved in monitoring the implementation of the plans and the expenditure of money in the regions.</P>
    <P>The committee on cutaway bogs to which I referred suggested that some of the new grasslands be made available to groups of aspiring farmers by way of either outright purchase or long term leasing arrangements.  I hope that suggestion will be given favourable consideration at the earliest opportunity by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>With the days of the Common Agricultural Policy numbered, Irish agriculture faces into a very difficult period. If we ensure that the most effective use possible is made of our land then we will help to minimise the problems to be faced.  If we do not do that the problems will be intensified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to join other speakers in wishing the Minister of State, Deputy Liam Hyland well in his new appointment. Like other Members, I have no doubt <Col N="864" /> that he, as a very capable, hard-working man, will apply himself to his new job in the way that he has applied himself since coming into the House.  I am sure that he will make a success of his appointment.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, we were talking about the Land Commission about two and a half years ago but, with an election approaching, it is only now that the issue has come before the House again.  This legislation provides the House with an opportunity to examine recent developments in farming.  In the early days of the Land Commission many large estates were divided up.  As the years went by, the Land Commission became involved in the division of smaller holdings, which made allotments more expensive for those who received them.</P>
      <P>While, as public representatives, we would often be frustrated and concerned about the delays in the division of specific estates and the lack of speed in land allocation generally &mdash; and over the years I tabled many questions in that regard &mdash; at the end of the day one would have to say that the Land Commission did very good work and improved the farming structure greatly.  Many farmers had their holdings made viable and were able to rear their families on what was originally a very small holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in common with other Members, I regret the position of the remaining Land Commission staff.  Many of those people are fairly young, well suited for many posts and have great experience in rural areas.  I join in the appeal to the Department and the Minister concerned that they seriously consider the re-employment of those staff members in other positions.  As has been said, those people would be ideally equipped to take part in and administer the programmes for greater rural development.  I pay tribute to Commissioner Ray MacSharry, a man who has been much maligned, for his contribution towards the provision of substantial funding in rural development programmes.  An issue that is of concern to me and to many other Deputies is whether there has been set up a structure under which we are able to make the <Col N="865" /> best possible use of the funding provided within the time limits imposed on its expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that farming has undergone a transformation.  Thirty years ago the Land Commission had a target size of 40 acres for a viable farm.  Farmers would now need twice or two and a half times as much land to have any chance of making a reasonable income from farming.  That acreage would apply only if one were involved in fairly intensive production, such as milk production; it would not apply to store cattle management.</P>
    <P>The integrated rural development programmes such as the Leader programme and the INTERREG programme provide an opportunity for the re-employment of Land Commission staff.  I know several of those staff members from my own constituency and I know that if they are not able to obtain alternative employment within the Civil Service they will be forced to sell their homes, take their children out of local schools and move. The impact on the families concerned should be taken into account.  Land Commission staff would be able to identify schemes that would suit particular rural areas.</P>
    <P>Only recently I tabled a Dáil question asking about the tonnage and value of grass seed imported in the most recent year for which records were held.  I was informed that £5 million worth of grass seed was imported.  It is a shame that we should be importing so much grass seed when we have areas, such as mine and County Louth, that are noted for high quality grass seed production.  That should not happen at a time when people are having to leave the land.  For many years we also imported large quantities of potatoes, a position which has now been turned around, principally by the efforts of former Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Kirk.  We now export potatoes to countries such as Sweden.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Land Commission would be well able to examine and give an up-to-date view on alternative enterprises for the use of land.  I agree with other speakers in their request for some <Col N="866" /> alternative structure within the Department of Agriculture when the Land Commission are abolished.  The Minister in his speech said that statutory control would be exercised over the subdivision of farms and over the purchase of land by non-qualified persons, namely, companies and non-nationals.  Rural Deputies are concerned about the amount of control over companies purchasing land and competing against landowners unable to raise the type of money required to compete with those companies, many of which are purchasing land for forestry with the aid of State grants.</P>
    <P>There have been delays in registering title deeds in the Land Registry.  The Minister should ensure that the registration of titles is expedited.  We could improve on the present situation, although I admit that individuals, perhaps requiring land from the family in order to build a house, for instance, have been facilitated.  However, many people who purchased land years ago are still awaiting title deeds.</P>
    <P>Prior to Christmas Deputy O'Kennedy, as Minister, following many parliamentary questions and much representation from Deputies, set up a working party to look into land annuity arrears.  The problems in this area were created over ten years ago when the Land Commission bought land at a high price and annuities were set at a high rate.  Many farmers now find it impossible to pay them.  Some farmers are required to pay an annuity of £70 per acre.  One would not need to be an agri-economist to know that one would not get £70 per acre in profit from cattle or any other projects at the moment.  These annuities are putting a big drain on farm finances.  A man with 20 acres could be required to pay something in excess of £1,000 per annum in land annuities.  The Minister set up a working party in his Department to look at the problem and propose an effective solution.  I hope the working party will soon report and suggest a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that retirement schemes and other incentives to move the land into younger hands were not really <Col N="867" /> successful.  The EC made a big effort in the 1974 scheme but it was not successful. At the time many of us saw this as a great opportunity to encourage farmers to transfer land to younger people.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Land Commission officers and staff on the work they have done through the years.  I would ask for the establishment of some structure to ensure strict monitoring of land sales in the future.</P>
    <P>I conclude by wishing the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a significant debate.  At long last we will see the abolition of the Land Commission.  Since 1983 only about 2,500 hectares of land remained available for distribution and no land has been acquired since 1983.  It is remarkable that it has taken up to now to arrange for the dissolution of the Land Commission.  Questions have to be asked as to what some personnel in the Land Commission are doing.  This has been dealt with at length by many speakers. We cannot fault the personnel in the Land Commission.  The intentions of the Minister were questioned at the time and the whole thing was handled in a hamfisted manner.  I hope the personnel with a lot of experience will be used on other schemes.  Many speakers referred to developments in relation to agri-tourism, in relation to the Leader programme and so on.  There is obviously a lot of work in which Land Commission personnel can be involved in the future. Deputy Hogan dealt at length with the history of the Land Commission personnel and what has happened to them. It would be wrong of me to go over the same ground again but I would ask the Minister to consider these people in relation to what is to take place in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must acknowledge the significant achievements of the Land Commission since 1923.  They have allocated over one million hectares of land and 2,000 families have migrated to new holdings.  New dwellings have been built and a lot of land has been drained, reclaimed and <Col N="868" /> fenced.  The Land Commission also provided roads and water supplies.  There were difficulties attending the achievement of these targets but in recent times confidence in the Land Commission has eroded.  Land was held by them for many years and when it was rented out on an 11 month basis a lot of people were disappointed.  The Land Commission were discredited.  They ran into many difficulties in the late seventies and early eighties in purchasing land because it was at a high price then.  When they were reallocating the land to farmers the land annuities were set at a high price.  This has been dealt with by many speakers.  I welcome the Minister's decision prior to Christmas to look compassionately at the situation which has evolved in relation to land annuity arrears.  It is regrettable that in recent times headage grants were taken by the Department in compensation for land annuities.  There is definitely a need for more compassion in this area.</P>
    <P>There is much concern over foreigners coming here and buying land and in relation to wealthy people purchasing land.  Previous speakers touched on the necessity of replacing the Land Commission with some type of land agency that would monitor and co-ordinate the work involved.  This is a good recommendation.</P>
    <P>There is scope for some agency to get involved in tidying up the loose ends in land distribution in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We all know that land is and has been an emotive issue down the years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record my commitment to ensuring that opportunities are provided for regular, detailed and well-informed Dáil discussion of developments in the Department's area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>I believe that an Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs would help to promote this kind of discussion and the Taoiseach and myself are well disposed towards the establishment of such a committee. In my view, the existing Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, in their seventh report published last February, made a persuasive case for establishing a new committee with wider terms of reference.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated in the Dáil on 18 February that proposals in relation to a Foreign Affairs committee will be brought forward shortly.  The terms of reference of such a committee will be a matter for the Oireachtas and there will be an opportunity for discussion with other parties in this House before decisions are taken.  This may be done through the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from any decision that may be <Col N="870" /> taken in relation to an Oireachtas committee, I envisage keeping the Dáil fully informed of developments in my area of responsibility through Question Time and through statements to the Dáil on appropriate occasions.  The Department will also continue to publish the six-monthly report on developments in the European Communities and the annual report on Ireland's Official Development Assistance.</P>

My good wishes are genuinely meant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, I congratulate him on taking the ball on the hop from the Opposition's demand for the setting up of a Foreign Affairs committee.  I am very glad the Minister has accepted the idea in principle.  I wish to see this committee set up with the minimum delay.  Will the Minister assure us that he will consult with the Opposition on the terms of reference of the proposed committee?  Bearing in mind our experience on other committees of the House will the Minister ensure that the committee have the power to send for persons, papers and records and also have the power to engage and remunerate advisers to assist in a particular field of inquiry if the committee so decide?</P>

      <P>I welcome the setting up of a committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Minister will agree I have had an interest in this area for some time.  On consultations on the appropriate terms of reference, will the Minister favour the strong end of the spectrum of a Foreign Affairs committee rather than the weakened, as for example the Foreign Affairs committee of the House of Lords?  Even if the committee were to fall short of the powers of the Danish Committee on Foreign Affairs I ask the Minister to consider striking the balance towards the Danish rather than the British end of the spectrum. Will the Minister comment on his personal orientation to such a suggestion?</P>

      <P>On the question of the orientation and terms of reference of the committee, it would be helpful if Deputy Higgins would discuss his views with his party Whip so that they can be discussed during the consultation process on the terms of reference. We would benefit greatly from his experience and wisdom in this area.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Title V of the Maastricht Treaty, which contains the provisions governing the future common foreign and security policy, Ireland's particular concerns in the field of security and defence are fully addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> Under the new Treaty the limitation in the Single European Act which confined the discussion of security issues to the political and economic aspects of security is removed so that security questions in the broadest sense will now form part of the future common foreign and security policy (CFSP).  The distinction between security and defence drawn by Ireland in the negotiations is upheld in the Treaty. Security issues are matters for the European Union.  Issues with defence implications may be referred to the Western European Union at the request of the European Union, acting by unanimity.</P>
    <P>These provisions do not change Ireland's position as a country outside military alliances.  They will not oblige Ireland to join a military alliance or involve us in a mutual defence commitment. Of particular importance to Ireland is the provision in the Treaty which states that the policy of the Union in the security area &ldquo;shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member States&rdquo;.  This provision echoes the conclusion of the European Council in Rome in December 1990 that the prospect of a role for the Union in defence matters should be considered without prejudice to the traditional positions of certain member states.</P>
    <P>The Treaty makes clear that discussions and decisions on the scope and content of a common defence policy are left to future negotiation at the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 1996.  Ireland has accepted this in keeping with our long standing commitment to enter into negotiations on a defence policy for the Community.</P>
    <P>The security dimension of the European Union should, of course, be seen in the broader context of the commitment in the Maastricht Treaty to the progressive development of the Union's political identity, including common action in the international sphere.</P>
    <P>Since before Ireland became a member of the Community there has been a process of consultation and co-ordination on matters of foreign policy known as European Political Co-operation.  This process, <Col N="875" /> which is codified in the Single European Act, has enabled the member states to co-ordinate their positions on foreign policy and to act together on a wide range of international situations &mdash; for example, in the Middle East, South Africa, Central America and Eastern Europe as well as on issues such as disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and human rights.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will share the assessment that the Twelve acting together have been able to play a positive role in international affairs.  The measures now being taken to strengthen existing procedures are designed to enable the European Union to play a fuller and more coherent role in international affairs commensurate with its standing in the world and its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The common foreign and security policy (CFSP), which under the Maastricht Treaty will replace European Political Co-operation however, is essentially a development and a taking forward of EPC and will share many features with the existing arrangements. The intergovernmental character of foreign policy co-operation will remain.  All important decisions will be taken by unanimity.</P>
    <P>A Government White Paper on the Maastricht Treaty will be published in a matter of weeks and will set out in detail the implications of the CFSP.</P>
    <P>I would add that the Government intend to bring to discussions under the CFSP and to the formulation of the Union's policies the values that have long informed our approach to international issues &mdash; respect for the rule of international law, commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, support for the United Nations and UN peacekeeping, concern for human rights and fundamental freedoms, a commitment to conventional and nuclear disarmament, our sense that security is broader than defence, and our conviction that causes of instability such as underdevelopment must also be tackled.</P>
    <P>As a small country heavily dependent <Col N="876" /> on a stable international environment, we will be in a position under the CFSP to contribute, in concert with like-minded democratic countries, to the building of an international society responsive to the values and concerns I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I apologise for the length of the answer.</P>

I am anxious to explore the Minister's own attitude to the question of neutrality and how that may inform his thinking while he holds office. Does he accept that the policy of neutrality evolved out of conditions that no longer pertain?  Does he further accept that we are in an evolutionary process that will inevitably lead to closer political union, with a common foreign and defence policy, that it would be disastrous for Ireland to stand on the sidelines while other member states shape the future of Europe and that we should be making our case at all levels?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential distinction to be drawn in the Treaty is between security and defence.  There are three options open to this country and a declaration in this regard has been sought. The options are: first, to join the Western European Union; second, to take up a position as observers within the Western European Union; and three, to opt out entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Collins, <Col N="877" /> attended the Western European Union as an observer on three occasions and that would certainly be the direction in which this Government would be thinking, that is, observer status.  This would not in any way undermine our general concept of neutrality, taking account of the fact that throughout Europe east and west, but more particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia, barriers are breaking down and the possibility of war becomes less likely.  We have a role to play as a neutral nation &mdash; for example, by participating in peacekeeping missions abroad as in the Congo and Lebanon. There is a question on the Order Paper about our commitment in Yugoslavia. That would be the general direction of our policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I encourage the Minister along the road towards observer status at the Western European Union. We can discuss membership at another stage.  Does he not accept that as the European Union evolves and as members of that union, we must ultimately face the decision that if that union is worth being in, it is worth defending?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter that will have to be decided by successors to this Government whether it be a Fianna Fáil Government, a Fine Gael Government, a Labour Government or whatever sort of Government we may have in the future.  It is not an issue we have to address immediately.  The Intergovernmental Conference, which I have mentioned, will take place in 1996 and we can take a position in respect of that. I do not feel that full commitment is the answer.  As the Deputy obviously supports me, if I am thinking on the same lines, observer status, in the first instance would be the proper position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has made clear the high priority attached by this Government to finding ways of achieving political progress in relation to Northern Ireland and of bringing violence to an end.  The policy of the Government is to support the process of round-table talks in the search for a solution which will address the three relationships involved &mdash; those within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between Ireland and Britain, the so-called three strands.</P>
      <P>The Government will take every opportunity to encourage agreement which will enable fresh talks to get under way and to promote a successful outcome. In this connection, the Taoiseach will be reporting separately to the House on the meeting which he had yesterday in London and with the British Prime Minister.  The prospects for political progress in relation to Northern Ireland were a major topic of discussion at that meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the opportunity afforded by yesterday's meeting to have separate discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Brooke, <Col N="879" /> which dealt with the scope for political progess.  I look forward to further discussions of this issue at the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I was also present, along with the Minister for Justice, at a very useful meeting which the Taoiseach had this morning with the Leader of the British Labour Party, Mr. Neil Kinnock, his Deputy, Mr. Roy Hattersley, and the party's spokesman on Northern Ireland, Mr. Kevin McNamara.</P>
    <P>The Government also attach great importance to the fullest possible contact with leaders of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach and I had the opportunity of a wide-ranging meeting with the SDLP on 24 February which dealt with all aspects of the current situation, including the prospects for political progress.  We have also indicated publicly our readiness to meet representatives of the Unionist parties of Northern Ireland at any time and at any venue of their choosing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if, since taking office, he has communicated directly with the Unionist parties and the Alliance Party specifically offering to meet them, or is the Minister simply reiterating the open public statements made by the former Taoiseach? Does he not think it would be worth-while, in the event that he has not already done so, to write directly to the leaders of those parties inviting them to meet him at a venue which would be suitable for all parties concerned?  May I ask him also if he would indicate in his talks with the British Labour Party &mdash; he may feel he is not in a position to say this at present &mdash; whether or not the British Labour Party are considering a review of their policy with regard to Northern Ireland which, as I understand it, is one of actively seeking the unity of Ireland which is clearly causing an obstacle to talks within Northern Ireland at present?  Finally, may I ask the Minister if he would indicate in what sense the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which has been referred to a <Col N="880" /> number of times by Government spokes-persons, must be on the table?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is over long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four parts to the question.  Regarding the question of a meeting with the Unionist and Alliance Parties, as the Deputy is aware, both the Taoiseach and I have indicated, albeit publicly, that we would be willing to meet them on any part of the island of Ireland of their choosing or at any mutual venue outside this island.  That stands and is a reflection of the previous Government's position in that regard.  The former Taoiseach indicated there was an open door so far as the Unionists are concerned and that still stands and is part of our policy.  The question of writing to the Unionists is something that, quite frankly, might be considered.  I will certainly have a look at it and I am grateful to the Deputy for the suggestion.  We had a very full discussion this morning with the leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Kinnock, Mr. Roy Hattersley and Mr. Kevin McNamara, in the Irish Embassy.  The meeting, over breakfast, lasted for an hour and a half.  The discussions were very far-ranging.  As I understand it, the Labour Party have not departed from their policy, the keystone of which is unity by consent.  I would have thought that that policy does not represent a threat to any tradition, as such; rather it indicates clearly what their intentions are.  The Government of Ireland Act, 1920, in the context of Articles 2 and 3, which aspire to the integration of the national territory would be a Nationalist position.  The Government of Ireland Act, 1920, set up Stormont and provides for the sovereignty of Britain in relation to Northern Ireland &mdash; that would be the Unionist position.  Both those positions in the second strand in the three strands of talks would be on the table in a discussion on the totality of relationships with all parts of the island.  It is a practical position to take, on the one hand Articles 2 and 3, which concern the Unionists and, on the other, the Government of Ireland <Col N="881" /> Act, 1920, which concerns the Nationalists. To extend the matter further, if the Deputy refers to Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement he will see enshrined there a balance and a desire to bring about the situation I have just described.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate whether he intends to establish contact, prior to the general election, with the various parties in the UK to ensure continuity after the general election?  Does he see further scope to expand the operation of the Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I was an original member of the Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier. Within its present functions, it appears to be operating very well.  Certainly it has done a number of things but more particularly it has shown our fellow trade unionists from the Westminster Parliament that we are normal human beings and we discovered that they have the same weaknesses as we have and so on.  In that regard it has broken down barriers.  I believe it will be very helpful and very successful.  I take the view that it is not a good thing to upset something that is a success and seems to be doing good.  If it is doing something else we can have another look at it.  In relation to the establishment of contacts in the United Kingdom, the position is that we have just returned from those contacts.  The Taoiseach has met the Prime Minister; I have met independently and concomitantly with Mr. Brooke and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, has met with Mr. Mawhinney, the Northern Ireland Minister on Security.  In addition to having met with Mr. Kinnock, Mr. Hattersley and Mr. McNamara, I met Mr. Douglas Hurd at the Lisbon Conference at the Council of Ministers on last Monday week.  Independently of all that, I met with Mr. Kevin McNamara <Col N="882" /> and the SDLP.  In the last fortnight there have been many meetings and a great deal of discussion.  As I said, we have met every shade of opinion bar the Unionists. That brings us back to Deputy De Rossa's question and it is one which must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it makes political common sense, that if everything is to be on the table at the talks, that the Government of Ireland Act should also be on the table?  Would he accept my gratitude that at the press conference yesterday evening the British Prime Minister emphasised his commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement? This should be of great importance in terms of what might happen after the general election if no one party are in control.  May I ask the Minister to watch carefully what appears to be a developing debate in Britain in relation to devolution in Scotland and Wales and the way in which Northern Ireland might get caught up in that debate which would amount to integration.  In that context, could I say, almost <i>sotto voce</i>, I was surprised that the Taoiseach used a particular word outside No. 10 Downing Street last night.  It must have been the first time in recorded history that a Nationalist spokesman, North or South, used the word &ldquo;mainland&rdquo;.  I assume that it was a slip of the tongue but I wonder about the thought processes that led to its use.  This is something that must be watched very carefully, particularly in the context of integration to which I have already alluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;mainland&rdquo; was a slip of the tongue.  It is a bit like the loose use of the words &ldquo;the British Isles&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that far off the mark; one is as bad as the other as far as I am concerned but I think the Deputy can take it that it was not intentional. It is interesting that the Deputy should remark on the question of devolution in <Col N="883" /> Scotland and Wales because that question was addressed this morning in our talks with the British Labour Party, without giving anything away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite correct and I bow to his experience in relation to Northern Ireland.  He certainly touched a chord and is on the mark. In relation to the continuation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and to who may be in Government after the general election, we got undertakings &mdash; I do not know whether one can get those things in politics nowadays &mdash; and indications that the Anglo-Irish Agreement and its processes will continue apace.  We received a commitment, on the one hand, from the Labour Party and from the Conservative Party on the other.  Therefore the bipartisan approach, as I understand and appreciate it, is still in place.  The Taoiseach will address the House on Tuesday next when the Leaders of the Opposition will have an opportunity to respond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take the opportunity to confirm, in relation to Articles 2 and 3, that he sees those Articles as a political aspiration to unity rather than a legal imperative? Second, in relation to his references to the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier, would he make it clear in any contacts he may have with Unionists that all sides of this House want to see the two vacant seats which have been reserved for the Unionists filled and that we want to see the Unionists take part in the process so that they can share in what the Minister described as the good feeling which has developed within that parliamentary body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will <Col N="884" /> appreciate, there are vacant seats at the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier and, as Deputy Currie knows, there were also empty seats at the New Ireland Forum. Unfortunately, this is nothing new.  We would certainly welcome the seats being filled.  Once more, in common with the rest of the House, I send a message to the Unionists that if and when they are willing to take their place in those seats they will be most welcome.  In relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, as I have already indicated, when we move to the second tier of the three strands of talks &mdash; the so-called Brooke initiative &mdash; Articles 2 and 3 may be discussed in conjunction with all other related matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, first, welcome the Minister's openness in responding to the questions being put to him? When the Minister replied to questions with regard to the British Labour Party he said that it was their policy to seek unity by consent.  Indeed, that would be the position of virtually everyone in this House.  The problem which arises is that the British Labour Party have no interim position.  Their spokesperson, Mr. Kevin McNamara, has indicated that in Government they would actively encourage unity by consent.  Clearly, that is causing considerable unease, to say the least, on the Unionist side of the equation in Northern Ireland.  In that regard I am concerned that the relatively underdeveloped position of the British Labour Party may be causing an obstacle to the talks process in Northern Ireland.  On that basis I ask the Minister to look again at the British Labour Party position and perhaps have further private discussions with them on how they may better express their position.  In regard to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 and Articles 2 and 3, our Supreme Court has clearly said that Articles 2 and 3 are not simply an aspiration but a legal obligation, if not a legal pledge.</P>

      <P>No.  That is in conjunction with the opening clauses of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and does not upset it in any respect.  So far as the British Labour Party are concerned, that is their policy.  They are a political party in another jurisdiction and while I would be sensitive to what the Deputy says, I am not certain that I could twist the arm of the British Labour Party spokesperson and the Labour Party in general to change their policy overnight but certainly I will tease out the views expressed by the Deputy and let him know in time the outcome of such talks.  In relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and the constitutional position as articulated by the Supreme Court, I assume that the Deputy is referring to the McGimpsey case.  I have nothing further to add in that regard.  As I said, the Articles will be on the table in the discussions in the three strands of talks, in particular in strand two.  Interestingly enough, the Deputy will have seen in the newspapers in recent days that Mr. Molyneaux has indicated that at that stage he will be prepared to discuss those and other matters.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 51 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child entered into force on 2 September 1990, one month after the twentieth state had ratified it.  It was signed by Ireland subject to ratification on 29 September 1990.</P>
    <P>The Convention is the most complete statement of children's rights ever made and is the first to give these righs the force of international law.  It establishes a set of common values and aims, valid everywhere, while at the same time taking account of the different cultural, social economic and political realities of individual states so that, within the rights common to all, each state may seek its own national means of implementation. The Convention acknowledges the primary role of the family and parents in the care and protection of children and the obligation of the State to help them in carrying out these duties.  The Convention has been ratified by 96 countries to date.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully committed to ratifying the Convention at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Foreign Adoptions Act and the Child Care Act, which were enacted before the summer recess last year, contain provisions necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention. The views of the Attorney General are being sought with regard to what additional measures, if any, are required to enable the Government to proceed to ratification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give any indication of how soon ratification can be undertaken and if the Attorney General has indicated what further steps may be necessary?  Will he indicate when the Attorney General was asked to give his opinion as it is now some time since the former Taoiseach agreed that the Convention would be ratified?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that late last year his predecessor, Deputy Collins, was in touch with me in regard to this issue?  He told me that the examination by Government Departments had been completed and that the matter had been referred to the Attorney General.  Is the Minister also aware that his predecessor stated that Ireland had played an active role in the drafting of the Convention and in contributing to ensuring that the rights of the unborn would be fully protected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

Therefore, it is very much in the public interest, particularly for child development legislation, to move to a position of acknowledging rights directly and later, if necessary, having ensuing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 41, 50, 58 and 63 together <Col N="890" /> as they have been put down in identical terms.</P>
      <P>During the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union last year Germany proposed that the number of its representatives in the European Parliament be increased from the present 81 to 99 to take account of the addition to its population arising from the unification of Germany.  It did not prove possible to reach agreement on this proposal. However the conference agreed that the member states of the Community will examine the questions relating to the number of members of the European Parliament before the end of 1992.  The aim will be to reach agreement on the number of MEPs and to carry through the necessary legal arrangements in good time for the next European Parliament election which will take place in mid 1994.  The agreement reached will have to take into account the possibility of further enlargement of the Community and the need to decide what should be the overall size of the European Parliament in such an enlarged Community.</P>
      <P>Discussions on these issues will take place in the near future in the Council of Ministers.  Ireland is positively disposed towards an arrangement which would ensure adequate representation in the European Parliament of the people of the eastern part of Germany.</P>
      <P>We will, of course, also be conscious of the need to ensure that Irish representation remains at an adequate level in any new situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the request by the German authorities for 18 extra members is not unreasonable in the context of the additional population as a result of a reunified Germany?  Will the Minister accept that if we support the German request in this regard it does not really affect our situation from the point of view of the numbers we have in the European Parliament, which amounts to 15 members at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If an application is made by the German Government in that <Col N="891" /> regard we would not be found wanting. However, for the formation of the House, the European Parliament, as the Deputy is aware, currently has 518 members.  The size of each national allocation is determined by the EC Treaty. The large states each have 81 members, giving representation of one member for 600,000 to 800,000 people.  The smaller states have fewer numbers.  Ireland has 15 seats, giving representation of one member for about 230,000 people.  The common complaint among larger states is that their populations are under-represented relative to the smaller states in the European Parliament.  As evidenced by the above approximation of representation this complaint is understandable and account will have to be taken of the reunification of Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the issue raised by Germany has much wider implications for eastern Europe on the one hand and northern Europe on the other, where there are also applications for membership?  Within a very short time on the basis of current ratios we could see a European Parliament closer to 1,000 members, which would clearly be unworkable as the Parliament is currently structured.  In that regard will the Minister circulate to Deputies a range of views on how the Irish Government see the European Parliament developing in future and how representation from countries like Ireland can be maintained in a way which gives some balance to the smaller countries of Europe?  There is a lot of pressure at European parliamentary level for more powers.  Clearly, that also must have a bearing on how the numbers in the Parliament develop and how the ratio of national members in that Parliament has an impact on decisions to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

An analysis of the future structure of the European Parliament in <Col N="892" /> the context of enlargement would not be unreasonable.  With this in mind, it is my intention to request the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs to assist the House in respect of the Deputy's request.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>Work on the White Paper on the Treaty on European Union is at present well advanced and the White Paper will be published next month.</P>
      <P>The White Paper will outline the course of the negotiations which led to the Maastricht Treaty.  It will contain the Government's assessment of the outcome and will comment in some detail on the contents.  The Houses of the Oireachtas and the people will shortly be asked to endorse the Treaty.  The aim of the White Paper will be to ensure that in reaching their respective decisions the Houses of the Oireachtas and the people will be fully informed of the impact of the issues involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister &mdash; I want to be reasonable in my request at this stage &mdash; if it is his intention that as much attention will be given in the White Paper to the economic implications of the proposals as to the monetary ones?  We should bear in mind that the monetary consequences of the <Col N="893" /> Maastricht proposals have been expressed with such specificity and there has been much public concern about the lack of clarity on the economic side.  Will the White Paper contain comprehensive information in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will presume to interpret what the Deputy has said and if I am wrong I am sure he will correct me.  As presently envisaged the White Paper will outline the Government's approach to the intergovernmental conferences on political union and economic and monetary union.  It will assess the outcome of the negotiations and indicate why the Government will recommend to the Oireachtas and the people that the Treaty be endorsed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the White Paper, I have asked my Department to issue a booklet outlining the key aspects of the Treaty mentioned by the Deputy and the reason Ireland signed the Treaty at Maastricht on 7 February last.  Copies of the Treaty in both Irish and English are available in the Library, but if any Deputy requests a copy for his personal use I will be glad to make it available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that we have a fair bit of ground to make up from the point of view of having a reasoned and reasonable debate on the Maastricht Treaty and that this has been contributed to by the fact that a Foreign Affairs Committee were not set up last year and we did not have a White Paper setting out the Government's position before the Treaty?  In view of this would the Minister now accept that there is a need, both on his part and on the part of the Government, to pursue a very active policy to ensure that people fully understand the issues and that the predictable opponents who are already producing ill-founded and emotional arguments against the case will not carry the day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Deputy for his support in advance of the publication of the White Paper.  I appreciate his support for the Treaty.  It <Col N="894" /> is my intention, within my competence, to produce a document which contains a formula of words which is as brief and simple as possible and which is in no way patronising to the community.  Hopefully, this document will set out the Government's position in simple language, language which people will understand and appreciate.  In other words, I want to ensure that there will be no confusion as regards the meaning, our intentions and the future of this country so far as Maastricht is concerned.  As the Deputy said, there will be certain opposition to the Treaty.  Of course, people are entitled to oppose the Treaty. If the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty fails, the consequences for this country over the next ten or 20 years in economic and development terms are too horrendous to contemplate.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe knows they are making a case for democracy and the tolerance of democracy. These questions which were put down by members of the Labour Party make reference to a White Paper and no more or less than that.  Would the Minister agree that the constitutional and parliamentary obligation of a White Paper is to set out options and not to sink to being simply an electoral document which is judged as successful if it gets the right outcome, like Deputy O'Keeffe's point of view, and unsuccessful and emotional if it facilitates people in weighing several different options and exercising their vote upon them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear <Col N="895" /> that it was not I who suggested that there should not be an emotional response to this issue.  In a democracy anyone who is opposed to the Maastricht Treaty is entitled to be so opposed.  We will have to try to convince those people who have a counter view that our view is right. They may seek to do the same thing with us.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other part of the Deputy's question, as I said, the White Paper will outline the Government's approach to the issue.  I am sure all the issues of concern to the Deputy will be encapsulated in that document.  Having studied the document we will then be able to hear and appreciate the Deputy's party's point of view on the matter.</P>

      <P>I rise simply to ask if the booklet the Minister intends to produce will present a balanced view of the Maastricht Treaty.  In other words, will it present the down side as well as the up side of the aspects on which the electorate will be expected to pass judgment?  There is little enough purpose in having a referendum for approval of something if people are not aware of what precisely they are agreeing to and what the good and bad points are.  I know it will be difficult for a Government who have entered into negotiations and agreed to a Treaty amendment to do this as well as they might otherwise do. Nevertheless, in the interest of a calm and rational debate it is important that the Government produce material which is seen to be balanced, calm and rational.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The United Nations have faced serious financial difficulties over the past decade. This situation is in large measure due to the regrettable failure of a number of countries to pay their assessed contributions to the budget of the United Nations, as they are obliged to do under Article 17 of the charter.  The situation has been made more difficult in recent years, as member states' demands on the United Nations have continued to increase, while the budget of the organisation has failed to keep pace with the added responsibilities placed on the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adequate financial resources must be made available by the member states if the United Nations are to discharge their responsibilities effectively.  This requires that member countries still in arrears honour their obligations in full and without further undue delay.  It also requires that all United Nations members meet their assessed financial shares so that the organisation can carry out their mandate fully, in particular in the area of peace-keeping <Col N="898" /> operations which has been expanded considerably in recent years.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will outline for the information of the House, the latest available figures provided by the United Nations Secretariat detailing the amounts owed by member states.  At the end of 1991, contributions outstanding amounted to $439 million, comprising $375 million for 1991 and $64 million for previous years. I would hope that with the new climate of confidence in the ability of the United Nations to function in an effective manner, those states still in arrears will soon be in a position to meet their obligations in full.</P>
    <P>The Government are owed £14.67 million from the United Nations arising from Ireland's participation in UN peace-keeping missions in Lebanon and Cyprus.  I am also circulating details of the amounts owed in respect of these missions.  The Government have repeatedly raised the issue of these arrears in statements at the UN General Assembly and in representations made to the UN Secretariat at the highest levels.  I can assure Deputies that I will take every opportunity to convey to UN headquarters our serious and continuing concern in relation to these arrears.  The Government remain committed to securing full reimbursement of the amounts outstanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate who is responsible for the bulk of the $439 million that is outstanding? My understanding is that the United States and the former USSR are responsible. Will the Minister indicate who, if anyone, is accepting responsibility within the former USSR for the money owed and is there any possibility that it will be paid given the serious position in which those countries now find themselves? Will the Minister indicate the period over which the £14 million due to Ireland has been accumulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the amounts owed to Ireland by the United Nations is a matter of continuing concern <Col N="899" /> to the Government and we are in regular contact with the UN Secretariat on the matter.  We also take every opportunity to raise the issue under appropriate agenda items at each session of the United Nations General Assembly.  The largest sum owing to Ireland is in respect of arrears of payments of our UNIFIL account.  The Secretariat recently authorised a modest increase in the monthly payment on account but this still falls short of the rate of reimbursement we would wish to see.  I am reasonably optimistic, since the overall question of UN financing is now a priority item on the agenda, that we will see a further improvement in the position this year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question about the length of time involved, subject to correction, I understand that sums of money have been outstanding to Ireland by the United Nations over a considerable period.  I am not certain about the time but I can find out for the Deputy the exact number of years and the amounts outstanding for each year over that period.  The Deputy asked another question but I cannot remember it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>Following the receipt of an informal request from the UN Secretariat, the Government have decided to make available up to 20 Garda officers and up to five Army officers for service with the UN peace-keeping mission for Yugoslavia. The precise numbers of Garda and Army officers will be determined within those limits as soon as the Secretariat has received responses from the 30 other Governments which were also approached to contribute personnel to the force.</P>
      <P>The UN force for Yugoslavia, to be called the UN Protection Force, or UNPROFOR, was formally established by the Security Council in its Resolution 743 which was adopted unanimously on 21 February.  The force is intended to be an interim arrangement to create the conditions of peace and security required for the negotiation of an overall settlement of the Yugoslav crisis.  Subject to any further decision by the Security Council, the force is established for an initial period of 12 months.  The Secretary-General has been requested by the Council to take the measures necessary to ensure its earliest possible deployment.</P>
      <P>The force will be under the command of the United Nations, vested in the Secretary-General under the authority of the Security Council.  The overall command in the field will be exercised by a force commander, to be appointed by the Secretary-General after consultations with the parties and with the consent of the Security Council.  The force will comprise: a military component of about 13,350 all ranks, including 100 military observers; a police component of around 530 personnel, under the command of a UN police commissioner who will report to the force commander; a civilian component, consisting largely of existing UN staff, which will perform a range of political, legal, information and administrative functions; and an air unit consisting of four fixed-wing aircraft and 27 helicopters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UNPROFOR will be deployed in the three UN protected areas which, for <Col N="901" /> operational purposes, will be divided into four sectors, as follows: western Slavonia, eastern Slavonia and the northern and southern parts of Krajina.  These areas will be demilitarised and all armed forces there are to be either disbanded or withdrawn.  The role of the UN military component will be to ensure that those areas remain demilitarised and that all persons residing there are protected from fear of armed attack.</P>
    <P>The role of the police component will be to ensure that the local police forces carry out their duties without discrimination. The UN mission will also, as appropriate, assist UN humanitarian agencies in the return of all displaced persons who so desire to return to their homes in the UN protected areas.</P>
    <P>The UN force is to be deployed in two stages: as a first step, the Secretary-General will immediately deploy elements of the force to assist in developing an implementation plan for the full deployment of the force.  It is intended that full deployment would follow upon the conclusion of the first stage, after the Security Council has reviewed the operation and its budget.  The main purpose of this two-stage deployment is to maximise the contribution the Yugoslav parties can make to offsetting the costs of the force, and secure the most efficient and cost-effective operation possible. Precise cost estimates for the operation are not yet available but will be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the detail of the Minister's reply.  Will the Minister seek an inter-departmental review between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence on the increased risks being taken by Irish troops and other forces working abroad on peacekeeping missions, and if such a review has been sought will it be published without delay?  Secondly, and importantly, will the Minister, in consultation with the Departments of the Defence and Justice, ensure that practical conditions such as remuneration available to Irish personnel working in those new areas is commensurate with <Col N="902" /> their idealism and generosity and is also at a level comparable with those applicable to other United Nations forces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Deputy's very helpful intervention in respect of the two heads to which he referred.  Certainly in the light of what the Deputy has said, special account will be taken of those suggestions.  I do not consider it unreasonable to expect that people who go abroad in the service of an international body and at the same time represent their country should be properly compensated so far as money can do so &mdash; altogether apart from the idealism involved, as mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am sure that all of us, both inside and outside the House, are proud of the role played by the Irish Army and the Garda in various peace-keeping missions around the world. Given the Minister's reply to the earlier questions relating to the £14 million owed to the State arising from our commmitments in a peacekeeping role, could the Minister say whether the further commmitment is expected to add to that sum or whether an arrangement has been made to ensure that the sum owed does not increase?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the answer is yes, there will be an additional burden.  I am not sure that one can put a price on peace.  However, I do recognise that, if we do have to dig a little deeper to bring that about, it is the taxpayer who takes up the tab.  It brings about an even more urgent position in relation to the discharge of what moneys are owing to us.  I should certainly be anxious to clear the slate in that regard.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one brief point in order to seek balance. I laud in every way the efforts of our peacemakers on the various UN missions and I encourage the Minister to get in the moneys due to us.  But does the Minister <Col N="903" /> not accept that we are deploying abroad troops and a small number of gardaí whom we would in any event be paying out of the national Exchequer and that to a degree we are being paid by the United Nations the cost of troops and gardaí who would otherwise have been paid out of the national purse?  It is as well for us to remember that for the sake of balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point of view. I understand, subject to correction that the payments will be made through the United Nations.  I assume that the Deputy does have a point that yes, we would in the ordinary way be paying those people as members of the Garda and Army personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 32, 33, 44, 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Article 3b of the Treaty on European Union provides that the Community shall act within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the Treaty and that action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty.  The Article sets out the principle of subsidiarity in the following terms:</P>
      <P>In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this is that the Community is to act only where it can do <Col N="905" /> so more effectively than can individual member states acting alone.</P>
    <P>Article 3b falls within those parts of the Treaty for which the European Court of Justice has jurisdiction.  It will therefore be possible for the court to adjudicate on the principle of subsidiarity.</P>
    <P>I believe that this principle, properly applied, is in Ireland's interest and that the definition of subsidiarity is not too restrictive.  It will not impede the evolution of the Community and will not undermine the operation of Community policies.  It represents a reasonable compromise and it is sufficiently flexible to allow for the continued dynamic development of the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask one brief supplementary question, as I know that my colleague, Deputy Connor, is anxious to have the next question taken.  Does the Minister not recognise a real danger that this principle may not be, in his words, &ldquo;properly applied&rdquo; and that the thinking behind subsidiarity as enunciated in the 1891 <i>Rerum Novarum</i> may not be the thinking applied?  Would he accept that there is an active danger that member states of the Community who want to restrict the development of the Community and who want in particular to restrict the Community budget may use, or perhaps abuse, this provision to reinforce their case for a tighter Community budget, which is not in Ireland's interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As with everything else, the possibility does exist.  I understand that the Government drew attention to it during negotiations.  However, the principle of subsidiarity is sufficiently flexible in the Government's view to allow it to achieve what it seeks to do.  I do not consider that the dangers as articulated by Deputy O'Keeffe are particularly high.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the principle of subsidiarity needs to be applied in a way that <Col N="906" /> ensures that the benefits of Community decision making are applied across the board to all citizens of the European Community and cannot be used by national governments to restrict, for instance, the application of beneficial social decisions at Community level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <P>Before the break I dealt with the history of the Land Commission and the necessity for change and for putting something in place to deal with land problems.  The original intention of the Land Commission was to give small farmers a livelihood.  Small farmers have been the subject of many discussion in this Chamber.  When we talk about small farmers I am concerned about the heavy dependence of farmers in disadvantaged areas on headage payments.  I am deeply concerned about a proposal under the 1992 headage payments in relation to an RSI or tax clearance number for farmers. This would be a new departure.  Many farmers to which headage payments apply are on unemployment assistance and there is a rather convoluted process involved in applying for that assistance. If these people are on unemployment assistance, have a medical card and have already been means tested, in most cases they are not eligible to pay tax.  While we are all concerned that everyone should pay their fair share of tax will the introduction of this RSI tax clearance number be an extra penalty on small farmers?  A leading farming organisation are meeting Deputies over in Buswells Hotel, as we are having this debate, to discuss this situation.  We have experienced a lot of pressure with regard to this new departure. Many people have predicted that this Minister will be a good Minister with regard to rural development.  I hope he will look at this whole scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to farming in general, concern has been expressed in this House on many occasions about afforestation. There is probably not enough planning <Col N="942" /> for afforestation and we have seen some communities being practically dwarfed by forests.  Either Coillte Teoranta or a private organisation often buy 60 to 100 acres of good land for afforestation.  If a farmer is interested in acquiring a small amount of good land from Coillte, Coillte should be sympathetic towards him.  In many cases that extra little acreage will only supplement an inadequate acreage belonging to the farmer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transfer of farms, there is quite a process involved for a person who wants to transfer a farm to a son or daughter having regard to eligibility for old age non-contributory pension. There is a need for some help in that area.</P>
    <P>It is time to dissolve the Land Commission. I trust that the Minister can gainfully employ the people who were employed by the Land Commission in other areas, making use of their skills and that he will consider the establishment of a land agency to succeed the Land Commission, or some body with an overview of developments.  I wish the Minister the best of luck in his new appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in congratulating Deputy Hyland on his new appointment.  We are very fortunate to have a man of his experience and wealth of practical knowledge of working the land who knows the requirements of the farming community. Deputy Hyland will no doubt live up to our expectations of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which was held up for a number of years.  Through no fault of the Land Commission they were semi-sterile. They had no work to do and they had no targets.  They were in a state of limbo for a long time.  I am delighted with this breakthrough.  Integration is to be the key note and a new agency is to be set up incorporating Land Commission staff in a new role.  The modern land section in the Department will have many new chores.  There should be continuity in the various areas and people with experience of dealing with problems on the ground should be retained in their local areas.  Staff from the rural areas <Col N="943" /> should not be shafted into Dublin and <i>vice versa.</i>  The experience of the people on the ground will be a great help in doing the new chores which will be allocated to former Land Commission staff.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is looking for chores for the Land Commission staff I can give him a list.  The first area would relate to scientific interest.  I have a list of over 100 locations in Mayo and Galway which have been designated as areas of scientific interest.  The people in the wildlife section of the Department in Bray, without any consultation with farmers, without even visiting the west, decided in their wisdom to identify certain tracts of land in every county as being of scientific interest.  The Department have no statutory power to designate tracts of land as areas of scientific interest.  A person whose lands were designated as an area of scientific interest in the Clifden area &mdash; Deputy McCormack is aware of this &mdash; brought a case to the High Court against the designation and won his case. I am glad the Judiciary found that the Department have no statutory right to designate land as areas of scientific interest.  Quite recently the members of Mayo County Council decided to set aside those areas designated as of scientific interest and as a compromise we added them as an appendix to the review of the county development plan.  There is no statutory basis for designation of lands as areas of scientific interest.  I suggest that the Minister give this job to the new land commission section within the Department.</P>
    <P>Land can be designated as an environmentally sensitive area.  In this case the Department of Agriculture and Food consult with the farmers concerned who are allowed to have controlled grazing in the particular area and they are also paid on a hectare basis under an EC Directive that deals with the control of flora and fauna.  As the farmers are consulted and are part of the scheme I would therefore encourage the establishment of environmentally sensitive areas.</P>
    <P>The EC also issue a habitat directive. <Col N="944" /> I believe I submitted the first habitat directive to the Office of Public Works but this is also relevant to the Minister's area of responsibility.  The EC has issued a directive to preserve and control habitats. It allows controlled use and controlled grazing of the land but it pays the farmer compensation.  I suggest that the Department should become involved in this area.</P>
    <P>We need to take a new look at afforestation. Forestry must be productive and the nation must recoup its investment. Thinnings are now coming on stream but we are not geared to deal with them.  The thinnings are piled up on the piers and harbours and rot before they are exported.  We do not reap the benefit of this product.  For that reason I believe we must have some programme to ensure that we reap the benefits of afforestation.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission officials did not have time to deal with our offshore islands and I suggest that they should now be dealt with under their new structure. Turbary rights are running out in some areas.  Unless we acquire turbary rights immediately people will be unable to acquire new plots in order to harvest the turf.  Bog can be acquired and divided in such a way that the turf can be harvested by machine.  The day of the slane is gone. Very few are now cutting turf with the slane and the work is now done by machine.  For that reason it is important that plots are divided in such a way that the machine can harvest the turf.</P>
    <P>The EC provide assistance for areas of high altitude.  We should have a look at this because no area in this country has been deemed an area of high altitude.  I ask the Minister to ensure that his officials treat this as special work.  Some areas would qualify for special grants.</P>
    <P>There is also work to be done on mountain grazing.  This will provide work for the existing staff.  At present it is impossible to get a Land Commission official to go out and subdivide commonages. Commonages have been sterile over the past number of years because it was impossible to get a Land Commission official to subdivide them.  The Land Commission officials felt that they were <Col N="945" /> in a limbo situation because they did not know what the future held for them.  I can assure the Minister that there is plenty of work to be done in subdividing commonages, for which there is a big backlog of applicants.  Farmers are now in favour of dividing the commonages.  In the past, there were a great many absentee landlords and the commonage was used by only a few, but people are now becoming aware that it is a very valuable asset and they want to ensure that they have their share and have the commonage subdivided. I ask the Minister to look at this again.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the land around our coasts does not belong to any particular tenant but for coastal protection purposes it is required that somebody owns it so that the county council, the Department of the Environment and other State agencies ensure that the land and housing is protected from coastal erosion by the continuing rising tides.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to hear about land drainage any more because we were overproducing agriculture produce, but I think that is a fallacy.  Drainage is always a necessity.  Arterial drainage is still necessary.  I ask the Minister to take account of this because there is still a great deal of work to be done under the Arterial Drainage Act, and the drainage schemes.  It is important that the Department officials liaise with Teagasc, the research body.  There is great scope for this liaison.  There is a great deal of work to be done on the installation grants for young farmers and some of this work should be taken from the overburdened Teagasc staff.  The Minister's officials could help in many ways to assist small farmers with tax returns.  Many farmers are unused to these forms and are paying large sums for the services of accountants.</P>
    <P>Officials could also assist the inspectors with regard to sheep tagging and cattle headage.  A sheep farmer receives a notice telling him to have his sheep ready for inspection on a given date.  That date may not be suitable with regard to his lambing programme.  If ewes and lambs are put into small pens for inspection <Col N="946" /> there is generally some fatality, at great loss to the farmer.  If there were organised tagging and headage inspections the loss would not be as great to those farmers. Inspections should be held at a time when it is convenient for farmers to bring their stock down from the hills.  Anybody who is familiar with sheep farming areas is aware of the climatic conditions and the problems which can be caused by poor visibility and so on.  It could take weeks to round up sheep and make them available for tagging.  It would be a great relief to farmers if the departmental staff could be involved in this work and it might prevent the trampling of lambs in pens.</P>
    <P>We have fallen behind in the TB eradication scheme.  For many years we have been trying to achieve a reduction in the incidence of TB in the national herd and we could speed up that process with the assistance of the staff in the Department.</P>
    <P>It would be invaluable if we could complete the work of land allocation.  Farmers, especially those who have completed 100 EC hours or who have completed farm apprenticeship schemes, as well as installation farmers, should get priority in any land distribution programme.  Some support must be given by the Department to those small farmers who are trying to eke out a living with very limited resources.  Any land that becomes available should be given to people in the three categories I have mentioned.  Farmers could also be subsidised to buy land or else be enabled to borrow the necessary money at a very low rate.  The Department could also be very helpful in implementing the Leader programme and the staff are also well equipped to deal with the extension of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Land Commission who did wonderful work with limited resources.  Their main achievement when they took over from the congested district boards was to institute the change whereby land annuities were paid to the Irish Government rather than to Britiain. That was a great breakthrough.  The acquisition of land is not always easy. They did away with the landlordism which some of us remember.  Under that <Col N="947" /> old system a tenant could be evicted at the whim of the landlord.  Those days are gone and people now own their land. Most people own their houses also and this is to the credit of successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission were also responsible for the valuation of land.  In some cases they over-valued and in others they under-valued the land, but they did the best they could.  Some farmers have experienced difficulty in paying land annuities in latter years, perhaps because the original valuation was too high.  Land annuities are assessed by the purchase price of the land.  The Land Commission cannot be blamed for the severe financial strain which some people are suffering.  They carried out their task with sensitivity and patience.</P>
    <P>Land division is a cemetery for a politician and if he puts his head into it he will not be around much longer.  If one farmer gets land, ten others are disappointed. We never got involved in that field of activity and, perhaps, that is why we are here today.</P>
    <P>The expertise obtained by the Land Commission is invaluable and must not be lost to the State.  I welcome the integration of the existing staff into a new section in the Department of Agriculture and Food and I am confident they will meet the challenges of today and of the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I compliment the Minister on his recent appointment. Indeed, it is with a sense of optimism and confidence, given the new look team in the Department of Agriculture and Food, that many farmers welcome the appointments and await with expectation the achievements which are heralded with their arrival.  I thank my colleague, Deputy McCormack, for allowing me to speak ahead of him: the train does not wait for seniority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with a sense of nostalgia that we are here closing the final chapter on the Land Commission.  The Land Commission had a very positive impact on the development of a rural economy and <Col N="948" /> gave many farmers a viable holding when they were involved in the distribution of land acquired among smaller holdings.</P>
    <P>The question of land policy in Ireland has always been an emotive one and was probably best captured by the recent film &ldquo;The Field&rdquo;.  The graphic story of the attachment which the Irish people had to the land and the whole impact which that had on our politics for generations &mdash; indeed for centuries &mdash; was truly captured in that film.  That attachment to land is equally strong today.  In closing the final chapter on the Land Commission I do not think this House can walk away from its obligations and responsibilities in policing land policy.  While the Land Commission have outlived their usefulness, I am of the opinion &mdash; and I would like to hear the views of the Minister and the Department on this &mdash; that some regulatory body will have to be put in place to police land policy in Ireland.  I do not believe that an unfettered market approach to land sales is socially, economically or environmentally desirable.</P>
    <P>I have had no direct dealings with Land Commission farms being subdivided but, coming from a political household, I vividly recall representations from farmers interested in acquiring additional land to make viable their existing smallholdings. In that regard I see evidence of the success of the Land Commission in many parishes and townlands throughout my constituency.  That visual success reinforces the belief that we cannot walk away from this area of responsibility in agricultural matters.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that some unfinished business with regard to the Land Commission's dealing in the subdivision of commonages remains to be completed. This work is of considerable importance and is controversial in my constituency. Many of us are awaiting the outcome of a court ruling on a particular case.  For those who are in a limbo at present it would be desirable that judgement be delivered on that matter as soon as possible. Subsequently, when that decision is given, what mechanism will be in place to police the possible subdivision of commonages if that is the outcome of the <Col N="949" /> court hearing, or is that matter to be left unresolved?  That is certainly unfinished business that has to be taken into account in the winding up process.</P>
    <P>I would like also to express concern, as has been done by a number of speakers, with regard to the staff.  It is my understanding that in any winding-up of State or semi-State bodies the procedure adopted is voluntary redundancies or redeployment of all existing staff.  Given the provisions in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that there are to be no compulsory redundancies in the public service, I would like to know what is happening with regard to the staff who were former employees of the Land Commission?</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult time in agriculture, given the proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and the conclusion of the GATT negotiations.  I had occasion to attend a farmer's meeting recently where those present understood that not alone was reform of the Common Agricultural Policy affecting their livelihoods but its place in the renegotiation of the GATT agreement was widely understood by the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>One of the principal planks advanced by the EC Commission for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy was that it would facilitate a return to more environmentally friendly farming.  That is a welcome development, but it is illogical to have that principle as a plank in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy when our own national Government are involved in grant aiding the destruction of many environmentally sensitive habitats, when land reclamation grants are still in existence when the Commission are paying money to set aside the best quality land in the country. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that anomaly.</P>
    <P>Despite efforts &mdash; inadequate efforts &mdash; over the past number of years, the trend has been towards fewer and bigger farm holdings.  In the absence of a body like the Land Commission to police land sales that trend is likely to escalate and the number of people employed in agriculture <Col N="950" /> will decrease rapidly.  It is regrettable that there has been no co-ordinated rural development policy by any Government for many years which would recognise that a central plank of job creation has to be the maintenance of the maximum possible number of people on farm holdings in rural areas.  The preservation of barely viable holdings was enhanced by the activities of the Land Commission over many generations when they provided additional land for smallholdings.</P>
    <P>In the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy it is likely that part-time farming will be of greater significance in the rural economy.  I fear that if we do not have a policing body, such as the Land Commission, to facilitate the creation of viable units the march of bigger landowners in swallowing up the available land at the expense of smallholders will result in the numbers directly employed in agriculture being significantly reduced and the capacity to participate in part-time farming will be eroded.</P>
    <P>One of the more welcome developments in relation to the incoherent approach adopted by the European Commission in reforming the Common Agricultural Policy is the introduction of the Leader programme.  It gives us an indication that there is light at the end of the tunnel and the first semblance of a rural development policy.  I hope that post-1993 the pilot programme will be significantly enlarged and the funding available for it will be greatly increased because it has enormous potential to revitalise rural economies.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food have been extremely helpful in assisting the groups involved.  I am familiar with two successful applications from my own constituency and I would like to make an appeal to the Minister on one issue.  I am not sure, however, if responsibility rests with his Department or with the Commission but the regulations which require each successful applicant to submit information to the Department on the extent of the Leader project impinge on the flexible approach adopted <Col N="951" /> to date.  The individual project managers are currently considering certain programmes and submissions which transcend the immediate area concerned.  I understand the Department have requested that a map delineating the extent of the project be submitted.  This is the first indication of obtrusive interference on the part of the Department and it is not helpful.  The project managers should have maximum discretion. The bottom up approach has been exploited to the maximum extent under the Leader project to date and any restrictions would be counter-productive.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me return to my original contention.  I do not believe the Department can walk away from their responsibilities with regard to policing land sales in this country.  Now that the Land Commission are being wound up we need a regulatory body, under the aegis of the Department, to police land policy.  I do not believe that it is either socially, economically or environmentally desirable to have no regulations laid down by the Department in that regard.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to dissolve the Land Commission and provide for attending matters, to quote the Minister's speech.  It is significant that this Bill has been before the House before.  It was first introduced in May 1989 but before Second Stage was completed the Dáil was dissolved.  I am confident, with the new team in place, that Second Stage will be completed on this occasion.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I suppose if Second Stage had been completed on that occasion I would not be here now to make a contribution on the Bill.</P>

      <P>Such an expression of humility is very unusual for Deputy McCormack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the purpose of this Bill is to wind up the Land Commission.  However, the matter <Col N="952" /> should not end there.  We should have a land policy or a land body to deal with the matters which will have to be dealt with once the Land Commission are dissolved. Such a body could utilise the expertise available in the Land Commission. Indeed, there is a necessity to establish such a body.</P>
      <P>We have to accept, however, that it is no longer necessary to carry out the functions that the Land Commission were established to carry out and that the commission have outlived their usefulness. They acquired land, and or an estate, sometimes by way of compulsory purchase orders, and then subdivided it among smallholders.  It was their policy to try to establish viable holdings throughout the country of approximately 45 to 50 acres.  However, that figure no longer holds true as the Land Commission would now find it impossible to establish viable holdings on that basis. Given the way agriculture has developed one would need to have a farm approximately three times that figure if it is to prove viable.</P>
      <P>Their policy at that time, as I said, was to buy and hold land for a number of years and then subdivide it.  Sometimes this system worked.  Indeed, Deputy O'Toole said that it could prove to be a graveyard for politicians if they tried to interfere in this process.  I bow to his wisdom in that matter, but there was a famous politician in my own area, who shall remain nameless, who believed that he should make representations on everyone's behalf.  If six or seven farmers in an area &ldquo;were in for a piece of land&rdquo; at least four or five were given a piece. Therefore, he got it right four or five times out of six.  He believed that it was a fairly good system.  I would not go along with him but then again I have never been involved because no large tracts of land have been subdivided since I became a Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission also relocated smallholders from the west, principally from my own constituency &mdash; they gave up their unviable holdings which were then subdivided among local people &mdash; on larger farms in Counties Westmeath <Col N="953" /> or Meath.  This was partially successful because the transition proved too difficult for some.  However, it was of help to the counties which adopted those good people from places such as Clonbur and Cornamona in Galway.  Indeed, a Gaeltacht was established in County Meath. We exported our culture to County Meath and helped them in that regard. We also exported a few footballers.  I noticed that a few of the people on the Meath football team which won the All-Ireland title were of Galway descent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they have played their part in County Meath, too. Much of the work the Land Commission carried out was useful.  With this in mind we need a body to replace them.  Not alone did Deputy O'Toole ask for such a body to be established but he spoke confidently about the work that they could do.  Perhaps he knows something that I do not know and that such a body is on the way.  There is plenty of work that they could do.  They could be involved in the division of commonages, which has been referred to.  Much work remains to be done in this regard, given the test case taken in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>There is other work that such a body could do without the need to acquire land at all.  I noticed that there is great fragmentation of holdings in County Galway.  Often in a townland there are five or six farmers, each with a little division of land, separated from another person who has a similar division of land. While it is always very difficult to get local people to agree on the allocation of their land, to bring all their units into one, very often a person from an agency such as the Land Commission &mdash; or what will now be a land authority &mdash; will be successful in having this work carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much work remains to be done in this area, particularly in County Galway.  The new body should also look at the whole aspect of areas of scientific interest.  I have been interested in this matter since it became a great problem in County <Col N="954" /> Galway in 1990.  At that time people discovered that large tracts of their land were in areas of scientific interest although they did not have any knowledge that this was the case.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance on Thursday, 8 February 1990, asking him to outline the powers which the Office of Public Works have to designate areas of scientific interest.  He replied that, in accordance with the overall functions of the Minister for Finance to conserve threatened species of flora and fauna, it was necessary to list areas which contain these species and which are known as areas of scientific interest.  He said the Wildlife Act empowered him to create reserves in areas of scientific interest.</P>
    <P>Without consultation with people in County Galway, mainly in Connemara, large areas were marked on maps as being of scientific interest.  I do not think anybody visited them to discover what they contained before they were designated as areas of scientific interest but farmers discovered when they applied for relevant grants that this was the case.  On 22 February 1990 in this House I raised on the Adjournment the case of a person who had applied for a forestry grant.  The forestry inspector visited the area and told him to proceed with the work. However, when he had about one-third of the land planted he received a letter from the forestry division saying they were sorry they had not contacted him sooner but, due to a problem with his application, they could not do so before now.  Apparently most of the townland of Ballyquirke falls into an area of scientific interest, they referred to No. 32 on the map, sheet 14, County Galway.  They went on to say that because of the regulations to which they had to adhere, they could not recommend any areas which fall within those of scientific interest for grant-aid.</P>
    <P>That farmer was clearly discriminated against.  Indeed, this happened on a widespread scale in Connemara, if that farmer or somebody else wished to offer their land or part of their land for sale it was reduced in value by a quarter &mdash; and maybe by three-quarters &mdash; depending <Col N="955" /> on what use could be made of it because it was declared an area of scientific interest.  This caused great anxiety and inconvenience to farmers in Connemara and led to public debate.  It became a national issue when there was an application for the building of an airport on a strip of bog outside Clifden.  Later, when they applied to Galway County Council for planning permission, it was discovered that the proposed airport strip was in an area of scientific interest.  Planning permission was subsequently refused. A case was taken by two landowners in the area, it was recently heard in Dublin and it was ruled that it was unconstitutional to declare areas of scientific interest without the knowledge, consent or consultation with the landowner. That is as it should be but it took two farmers in Connemara, who could ill afford it, to take a case to prove that their constitutional right was being interfered with in having their land declared an area of scientific interest without their knowledge.</P>
    <P>Other unfinished work of the Land Commission which must be dealt with by a land body &mdash; or whatever the new body is called &mdash; is land acquired by the Land Commission and subsequently divided. Farmers obtained land at an annual annuity of probably £90 per acre.  That is now over the 11 months' rated renting value of the land and, with the decline in farm incomes, farmers were unable to meet the annuities.  It would have been better for some of them if they had never acquired this land because they are not able to meet their financial obligations. Something must be done to clarify and rectify this.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention environmentally sensitive areas which are totally different from areas of scientific interest. The Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, has already taken action in this regard, he announced details of a programme last week and kindly sent me a copy.  He designated those lands as special areas of operation and some of them are in my constituency near Clifden, Errislannon, Doonloughan and Bonowen, places I <Col N="956" /> know well as I had occasion to visit them before to negotiate business successfully. It is a beautiful area and there is nothing wrong with what the Minister proposes to do there because those areas will be designated only where people agree to co-operate in reducing stock rate and natural farming practices.  It would not be very hard for the people of those areas to continue natural farming practices because of the quality of the land.  I have no doubt that a scheme will be taken up and welcomed enthusiastically in those areas.</P>
    <P>With the dissolution of the Land Commission I do not know whether there should be a watchdog committee in relation to the fact that non-nationals, or at any rate, those outside the EC, can acquire any amount of land here provided they are able to pay for it.  Of course, they are probably in a better position to pay for land than nationals or local people who wish to acquire more land. Even now, in areas like Connemara, when an old house, site or a few acres come up for sale they are generally bought by non-nationals.  I do not know whether we can do anything about this. It is probably not a desirable practice because it makes it impossible for people who wish to stay in their own areas to acquire a house, site or an addition to their holding.  They are not able to compete on the open market.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that any body set up to replace the Land Commission &mdash; everyone seems to be in favour of such a body, and I presume they will be set up &mdash; will examine the previous role of the Land Commission in sanctioning the purchase of land.  We have to face up to this issue and see what can be done.  Farming is going through a difficult period at present.  These problems will not be alleviated if farmers are not able to increase their holdings by buying land on the open market.  This is the area in which the Land Commission will probably be most missed.  I look forward to the establishment of a body to replace the Land Commission.  Hopefully, they will use the expertise gained by the Land Commission over many years in regard to <Col N="957" /> such issues as fragmentation, subdivision and allotment of land to farmers.</P>

      <P>The abolition of the Irish Land Commission was first mooted in 1983.  We were told then that they would be replaced by a land authority.  We have been waiting since then for the establishment of a land authority, but they have not appeared on the horizon. Around the same time the Department of Finance decided that farmers were not paying their fair share of income tax.  At that time some farmers were in the happy position of being able to pay income tax. However, very few farmers are in that position at present.  The amount of income tax paid by farmers during those years was based on the poor law valuation of their farms.  The constitutionality of this system was tested in court.  During the last century a valuation was put on the land in each county which for one reason or another was not very equitable. Some parts of Counties Roscommon, Leitrim and Mayo were valued as highly as some of the more fertile plains of County Laois, the Minister's county.  The unconstitutionality of that system was upheld by the courts and no tax could be collected from farmers for a certain period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not to be defeated, the Department of Finance instituted a soil survey of land in the Twenty-six counties.  The people employed to carry out the survey were former employees of the Land Commission. This survey, which began in 1985, was based mainly on soil type, soil depth, the altitude of the land and general topography &mdash; the ability of land to grow crops, including grass.  Needless to say, the Department of Finance knew that farmers who had fewer than 40 acres, 50 acres or 60 acres would not be liable to pay much income tax.  Therefore, the <Col N="958" /> first farms surveyed in each county had more than 250 acres; the next farms surveyed had between 200 and 250 acres, and so on.  The survey was carried out from August 1985 until 1 March 1987. Approximately 20 per cent of the farms in County Roscommon &mdash; I would say this was typical of the entire country &mdash; were surveyed.  Because of the vagaries of political thinking, the then Government were deposed and Fianna Fáil plus their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Most certainly not.  One of the first things Fianna Fáil did when they took office in 1987 was to abandon the soil survey.  I understand that the information which had been collected by the survey team up until then was destroyed. This meant that the survey was of no use.</P>
      <P>Since that time the Irish Land Commission have found themselves in no man's land.  At present approximately 60 Land Commission inspectors are located throughout the country.  These are mostly based in the five counties of Connacht, Counties Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Longford, Clare, parts of Kerry and parts of Cork.  What will become of those people when the Bill is enacted?  We have been told that some of them will be brought back to Dublin where positions will be found for them.  If the Land Commission inspectors are brought back to Dublin rural Ireland will lose a valuable asset.  These people know the quality of the land and the type of farming carried out in various counties.  It will be a pity if their services are lost to rural Ireland at this vital time in the history of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When land comes on the market farmers must pay the open market price. Some people have formed companies to buy land for afforestation.  I am not against afforestation in certain parts of the country.  Indeed some land should have been planted years ago.  However, this does not mean that we should allow for a situation where every plot of land can be bought by companies for afforestation purposes.  If a 40 acre farm comes on the market it should be possible to <Col N="959" /> divide it in three so that three local farmers get 13 or 14 acres each.  Alternatively, the land could be divided in two so that two farmers get 20 acres each.  This could mean the difference between a farmer having a viable holding or a non-viable holding.  A farmer with 30 acres, 35 acres or 40 acres of land will not be able to compete on the open market for any land which becomes available.</P>
    <P>I mention this point because I believe the former employees of the Land Commission have a role to play in this area.  They are very highly qualified and they know more about soil types and farming types than anyone else.  They could have a role to play in deciding whether land should be sold for afforestation purposes or sold to local farmers who are trying to eke out a living and make their holdings viable.  This point is of the utmost importance at present, especially since the alternative appears to be the transfer of these men from rural Ireland to the cities, where the knowledge they have gained over the years will be of less value and where they will possibly vegetate.  The main problem with farming at present is its non-viability due to very low incomes.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Farrelly gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the plans the Minister for Education has for the development of accommodation at St. Mary's Diocesan School, Drogheda, and if he will allocate sufficient funds in 1992 for the commencement of this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate the new Minister of State at the Department of Education and wish him well in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Mary's Diocesan School, Drogheda, was built in 1967 for the accommodation of 250 pupils.  The total <Col N="960" /> number of pupils in that school today is 590.  This is one of the worst cases of overcrowding I have witnessed in all my time in public life.  In 1990 the school authorities applied for planning permission to build two extra prefabs.  Planning permission was given on condition that by January 1993 they would be removed.  The only conclusion I can come to for the inclusion of that condition is that there is a possible fire hazard in this case.  The school consisted of a total of eight prefabs, but unfortunately a few months ago two of these prefabs were burned to the ground.  As a result some classes have to be held in the home of the school principal, which is very unsuitable.</P>
    <P>I visited the school last Friday and on my tour with the principal, Fr. Rice, we met a teacher with 30 pupils looking for a classroom in which to teach the class.  I never witnessed anthing like this before. It was not a set-up but is a daily fact of life at this school.  I would ask the Minister to accept the contribution from the school management board and to provide funds from the Department to ensure that the school is completed by September 1993. This problem has reached crisis proportions. I have never witnessed such conditions in any school.  The majority of the prefabs are 40 years old.  I know that this problem is not the fault of the present Minister or indeed the last Minister.  It has been ongoing for years.  The prefabs will collapse if there is a heavy fall of snow.  I would ask the Minister to provide funds for this project in addition to the contribution from the school authorities so that it can go ahead within the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Alyward)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank Deputy Farrelly for his very kind comments.  I am grateful for this opportunity to respond to the matters raised by Deputy Farrelly regarding St. Mary's Diocesan School.  I am indeed aware of the unsatisfactory position at St. Mary's where the school is housed entirely in prefabricated accommodation. This is not the most desirable <Col N="961" /> form of long term school accommodation and I am glad to say that plans to alleviate the problem are well advanced.</P>
      <P>In 1985 the Department approved a proposal to provide permanent accommodation for 600 students.  This accommodation was to be provided in two phases.  Phase one was to provide for 350 pupils with phase two to follow at a later stage.  As with all such major projects in planning, it was necessary in 1989 to carry out a detailed review of the proposals in view of the declining demographic trend which had become evident throughout the country.  A review of the figures by my Department suggested that the capacity of the school be reduced to 500 in the long term.  However it was decided that in the context of the long term projections and the poor condition of the overall accommodation at St. Mary's the proposed phase one extension should proceed as planned.  It is estimated that the first phase will cost £1.4 million, including building, furniture, equipment and fees.  The accommodation which will be provided in phase one will include five general classrooms, two lecture rooms and eight specialist rooms as well as a general purpose area, kitchenette, staff accommodation and other facilities.  In all the total area of the school will be 1,800 square metres.</P>
      <P>I was distressed to hear about the recent fire at the school which destroyed two prefabs.  My Department have given approval to the school authorities for their immediate replacement.  In addition, approval has been given for an extra prefab to cater for the increasing number of pupils in September 1992. Although architectural planning for the new school has been completed, I am not in a position to give a precise date for the commencement of the project.  Nevertheless, I fully appreciate the difficulties currently affecing St. Mary's Diocesan School.  Every effort will be made, having regard to the availability of capital resources, to allow the project to proceed this year.  I will keep the Deputy informed of the progress in the matter.</P>

    <Col N="962" />
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The story of the Ballymun interchange is a story of secrecy, deception, lack of public consultation and misuse of EC funds.  From start to finish the Dublin County and City Councils involved in this interchange have shown little regard for the interests of the rights of the inhabitants of Ballymun or Glasnevin North.  They have also shown little regard for the public representatives of this area and adjoining areas.  They have gone so far as to suppress documents which show the true extent of the devastation caused by their plans.  They have misled and manipulated councillors and have generally acted in a Stalinist and totally Fascist manner, as if the requirements of democracy, fair play and openness are just disruptive impediments to their grand plans.</P>
      <P>The motion passed in the Dublin City Council for a section 59 agreement did not refer in any way to the Ballymun interchange on the route and all local public representatives have gone on record as being unaware of the proposal. The only public consultation was through an advertisement which just referred to the Dublin County Council area and obviously did not attract the attention of the people in Ballymun or Glasnevin North who are in the Dublin Corporation area.  The first time the residents learnt of the proposed interchange was in November 1990.</P>
      <P>The effects this road will have on the local community are devastating.  The Dublin County Council laid them out in their Community Impact Assessment, which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traffic using the Ballymun Road is likely to increase substantially with the Northern Cross route as it will provide a good fast access road... the increase in traffic will mean that it will be generally dangerous to cross the dual carriageway at grade and all crossings will have to be made by subway or bridge... a heavily trafficked dual carriage with a busy roundabout is not <Col N="963" /> suitable for cyclists.  Consequently a separate north/south cycleway will be required. </P>
    <P>None of this assessment made its way into the published Environmental Impact Study, which says merely that &ldquo;There will be some severence at local level on a number of individual properties mainly for cyclists and pedestrians.</P>
    <P>None of the measures to provide cycle-ways or pedestrian crossings proposed in the Community Impact Assessment are planned.  The Community Impact Assessment itself has been suppressed by the council and corporation officials and the City and County Manager has denied its existence.  But a copy of this document has come into my possession.  It makes shocking reading &mdash; no wonder these Stalinist officials suppressed it.</P>
    <P>I have to say also that the EIS assessment is a sham.  It fails to take into account any indirect problems caused by the motorway.  It makes predictions which are obviously wrong, such as predicting a decrease of noise levels on the Ballymun Road from 67 to 59 decibels despite an increase in traffic.  In its section on the socio-economic environment it mentions Portmarnock Golf Club and Howth Marina but makes no mention at all of Ballymun, which is recognised as one of the most socially deprived areas in the country.</P>
    <P>On a persistent basis in the Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation the officials have misled councillors.  Contrary to the Community Impact Assessment, councillors have been told that the Ballymun Road is suitable for cyclists and that pedestrian bridges can be provided &ldquo;if it were found necessary at some future date&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Wildly divergent figures for forecast traffic levels have been supplied to the city and county councils based on two conflicting studies.  Dublin Corporation are predicting a decrease of 44 per cent in traffic on the Ballymun Road leading to the interchange, whereas Dublin County Council predict an increase of 70 per cent on the same stretch of road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> Council officials have even been willing to solicit letters from Aer Rianta to back up their case and then present them as if they were written on Aer Rianta's own initiative.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been lodged with the European Commission and the European Parliament about the lack of consultation and the failure to publish an adequate environmental impact study but council officials deny any knowledge of the investigation which the Commission is carrying out.</P>
    <P>The effect on the local community, as I have said, would be devastating.  The increase in traffic would pose a major traffic hazard for 8,000 local pupils and students attending schools along the Ballymun Road.  The children of the Ballymun flats will find one of their open spaces has been converted into a roundabout and one of the internal roads of the flats converted into an access road for this roundabout.  The existing road without the additional traffic is a major hazard in that it runs right through the centre of a large community.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Mary Harney, promised the residents she would put their case to the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, and the Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>She said: &ldquo;It is obviously unacceptable for a development of this sort to go ahead without proper consultation with the community&rdquo;.  I would ask her and the current Minister for the Environment to stand over this and to delete the interchange from the Northern Cross Route.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity of putting on the record the procedures which were observed and followed in reaching a decision on the Northern Cross Route Motorway scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Northern Cross route is the northern leg of the Dublin Ring Road and is a continuation of the Western Parkway Motorway.  It will run between the N3 Navan Road at Blanchardstown and the <Col N="965" /> N1 Belfast road at Turnapin.  There are also ancillary roads including an extension from Turnapin along the line of Turnapin Lane/Belcamp Lane to the Malahide Road, and the re-alignment of the Ballymun Road where it intersects with the proposed motorway.  The new road will be 10.1 kilometres long with a dual two-lane facility.</P>
    <P>Interchanges are proposed at four locations &mdash; Navan Road, Ashbourne Road, Ballymun Road and at Turnapin on the new Airport Road.</P>
    <P>The motorway scheme for the Northern Cross route was prepared by Dublin County Council acting on their own behalf and on behalf of Dublin Corporation in so far as sections of the proposed scheme lie in the administrative area of the corporation.</P>
    <P>The county council also prepared an Environmental Impact Study for the scheme in accordance with the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Motorways) Regulations of 1988, which give effect to the requirements of the EC Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment in so far as motorways are concerned.</P>
    <P>These regulations require that, before making a motorway scheme under section 4 of the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, a road authority must have regard to the preservation of scenic and natural amenities and must prepare an environmental impact study of the proposed motorway which must identify, describe and assess the direct and indirect environmental effects of the construction of the proposed motorway on human beings, fauna and flora; on soil, water, air, climate and the landscape; on material assets, and on the cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>The regulations lay down the type of information which must be provided in an environmental impact study.</P>
    <P>On 2 April 1990 Dublin County Council gave public notice of the making of the motorway scheme.  The notice advised the general public of the availability for inspection of maps, plans and the Environmental Impact Study relating to the scheme.  It also advised the general <Col N="966" /> public that a public inquiry would be held into all matters relating to the scheme and that the Minister, before approving a scheme, would consider the report of the person who conducted the inquiry and any objections which had been made to him and which had not been withdrawn. Notice of the motorway scheme and the Environmental Impact Study were sent individually to persons directly affected by the scheme and to prescribed bodies such as the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and An Taisce.</P>
    <P>On 19 June 1990 public notice was given of the holding of a public inquiry into the motorway scheme, including the environmental impact of the proposed motorway, and objections which had been received against its approval.  Persons directly affected by the scheme and those who had lodged objections were notified individually of the arrangement. The inquiry was held over three full days from Tuesday 26 June to Thursday 28 June 1990.  A total of 39 submissions were lodged with the then Minister before the inquiry and a further five submissions were made by members of the public at the inquiry.  After considering the evidence taken at the public inquiry, the report of the inspector who conducted the inquiry and the Environmental Impact Study, the then Minister approved the motorway scheme, subject to modifications, on 7 February 1991. Public notice of the making of that order was given on 28 February 1991.</P>
    <P>I point out to the Deputy that the situation following the publication of notice of the approval of a motorway scheme is that persons aggrieved may, not later than 21 days after publication of the notice, apply to the High Court questioning the validity of the motorway scheme as confirmed.  No such action was taken in this case.</P>
    <P>I am aware of some of the problems which the Deputy has raised.  I am equally aware that meetings have been held between Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and representatives of the Glasnevin North Community Council, the Ballymun Environmental Task Force and the local elected representatives. <Col N="967" /> These meetings are being held with a view to identifying whatever problems there are and, having identified them, to come up with a solution to them. My understanding is that these meetings are continuing.</P>

      <P>I commence by wishing the new Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, well in his new job.  I hope that he brings to his Department the same refreshing attitude that he has brought to the House over a long period.</P>
      <P>In the budget speech of the Minister for Finance he stated that £22 million would be paid in 1992 for the purpose of making substantial retrospective payments. I ask the Minister when payment of that £22 million will commence.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's budget speech he also said that there would be further substantial payments in 1993 and 1994. Could the Minister for Social Welfare tell the House what percentage of the retrospective payments due will be paid in 1992; what amounts will be left until 1993; and what amounts will be left until 1994?</P>
      <P>Both the House and the public need to know whether it is only women who will benefit from these payments.  Are there any benefits due to men under the equality payments?  I know that substantially the payments are due to women but are they due exclusively to women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know when the payments will come about because increasingly people are contacting the Department of Social Welfare, the Department are not able to tell them anything, and those people are coming to see their TDs, TDs are getting in touch with the Department and nobody knows precisely what is the position.  In the meantime, there is increasing expectation building up.  I hope the Minister will use this opportunity to clarify the position as far as he can and that he will be in a position to announce when payments will commence.  There is a huge <Col N="968" /> expectation among people who may not qualify at all, people whose husbands did not lose payments and people who were widowed at the time, who perhaps were not affected by the equality payments, and are unsure of their position.  The sooner this matter is dealt with and people know where they stand the better it will be for this House and for the Department.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that these payments will commence this year.  I regret that we have to wait until 1994 to clear up the matter completely.  The people who will be paid this year should know, as should the people who will be paid next year and the year after, so that we will not have a huge number of people building up expectations and perhaps even making commitments which they will not be able to keep.  I hope the Minister will be able to indicate the average level of payment to each recipient under these arrears and that he will be in a position to give as much details as possible, because this is of increasing concern to members of the public.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for his kind remarks.  I hope to live up to some of his expectations.  I am sure I will disappoint him in others, but I will do my best.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mitchell knows, this is a complex area.  The Deputy has raised a number of important points and I hope to be able to answer some of them.  This has gone on now for a long number of years.  Eventually there will be a legal case with a severe cost to the State.  At least the Government this year have gone some way towards relieving the problem in accepting the court decision and in back-dating these payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas of the social welfare code which were discriminatory within the terms of the equal treatment directive related to the entitlements of certain married women.  There were four such areas. Married women received lower personal rates of benefit in the schemes of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational <Col N="969" /> injuries benefit.  Married women received unemployment benefit for a maximum duration of 12 months as against 15 months for claimants generally.  Increases were not normally payable to married women in respect of adult and child dependants and married women in general were precluded from qualifying for unemployment assistance.  The deadline for implementation of the Directive was 23 December 1984 and the necessary provisions to introduce equality treatment were provided for by way of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985.  The provisions of that Act were brought into force by way of commencement in two phases in May and November 1986.  In May 1986 provision was made for an increase from 12 to 15 months for the maximum duration of unemployment benefit payable to married women and at the same time reduced rates of certain benefits payable to married women were replaced by the standard rates.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced in November 1986 provided for equal treatment in relation to increases for adult and child dependants and for the admission of married women to the unemployment assistance scheme on the same basis as claimants generally.  The delay in implementing the necessary provisions resulted in a number of court proceedings arising from which three separate references were made by the Irish court to the European Court of Justice for preliminary rulings under Article 177 of the Treaty.  Following detailed consideration of the most recent decision of the European Court, the Government have decided to provide for equality of treatment in respect of the period of delay in implementing the Directive.</P>
    <P>As announced by my predecessor, the necessary legal provisions will apply retrospectively from the deadline for implementation, that is December 1984, to the actual dates of implementation in May and November 1986.  The retrospective payments involved will be made on a phased basis over the period from 1992 to 1994.  Under the first phase, all married women who received a reduced rate of benefit during the period of delay <Col N="970" /> will receive a higher amount this year. At the same time, married women who exhausted their entitlement of 12 months of unemployment benefit during this period will be paid for the additional three months subject to appropriate evidence of unemployment in respect of any such period.  The cost of this phase, which will be made this year, is £22 million, a sum the Government have provided for in the budget.  The necessary resources are being made available by the Government.</P>
    <P>Details of the payments to be made under the second and third phases will be announced as soon as the proposals are finalised.  At the same time, the necessary legislative provisions which are being made by way of statutory instrument under the European Communities Act will be introduced.  Work on the overall package is at a very advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to announce the precise details of the payments to be made under the second and third phases within the next month or so.  Work on the necessary administrative arrangements to enable the payments to be made is already underway in the Department. A very significant volume of claims will have to be processed under the retrospective legislation and it is not possible as yet to provide a precise date in the current year as to when amounts payable under first phase will be made, but in fairness to Deputy Mitchell, I do not expect the payments to be made within the first six months of this year.</P>

The areas of the social welfare code which were discriminatory within the terms of the Directive related to the entitlement of certain married women only.  Consequently, payments will not be made to <Col N="971" /> married men under the proposed legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address this lamentable problem but before doing so I offer my congratulations to the new Minister for Justice.  I do not congratulate him because it is conventional or timely but because I have genuine faith in him in bringing to that Department the expertise, consideration and success he demonstrated elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I am gravely concerned, almost revolted, by the growing incidence of the most unwelcome and unnatural crime of incest with its devastating consequences for the victim, the family and for society. The obvious failure of the existing legal structures and its practitioners to grapple with the menace and protect the rights of the victims is alarming as is their failure to reflect the will and wishes of all right minded, normal citizens.  Almost weekly now, we have evidence of this inadequacy and, at times, of court decisions which appear indifferent to the crime, in so far as technical and puerile points of law take precedence over natural justice, commonsense and reason.  My real concern is for the unfortunate victims and for true justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the subsidiary and important point of respect for and faith in our courts.  How can I or any fairminded, <Col N="972" /> reasonable citizen accept a situation where a father accused of incest by his daughter and who did not deny that the girl was his daughter walked away in innocence from judge and jury because his wife was not present to satisfy the legal nicety and nonsense deemed necessary to prove his guilt?  What will happen if the mother is dead or unavailable? Does that mean that henceforth the unfortunate daughter or child victim cannot have justice against an accused father because of this idiotic and nonsensical precedent?</P>
    <P>In my opinion in this and in other matters law reform is urgently needed.  I think there should be an input from people who are not themselves legal practitioners with, one might say, vested interests.  We must take a new approach to the whole system and perhaps introduce a European or Scottish style system where the accused will not get the protection which heretofore has been his right under our system.  I look forward to hearing the response from our new Minister who is a reformer &mdash; I would not want him to be a revolutionary &mdash; and I hope he will reform the present laws so that justice will not only be done but be seen to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his kind words at the start of his contribution.</P>
      <P>In so far as this particular case is concerned, there is concern inside and outside this House about the level of child abuse.  I am glad that the Deputy has brought up the matter as it gives me the opportunity to say a few words this week and I hope to have the opportunity to say a great deal next week on another related matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to a particular case so I should make it clear formally &mdash; though I know that Deputies are aware of this &mdash; that I have no official responsibility for the initiation or conduct of prosecutions. What I take responsibility for is seeing that in so far as possible the law, and especially the law of evidence, does not hinder bringing persons guilty of <Col N="973" /> incest to justice.  As regards the general law, the Law Reform Commission in their report on child sexual abuse recommended that there should be no change in the present law on incest.  As regards the law of evidence, the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992, which is now coming before the House, makes a number of important amendments in that law following other recommendations of the commission in the same report.  I am happy that we will be debating that Bill next week because it is genuinely reforming legislation.</P>
    <P>Turning to the actual case that gave rise to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's question, the difficulty lay, I understand, in proving a relationship between the accused and the alleged incest victim. There are two further provisions in the Criminal Evidence Bill that we will be dealing with next week and these will deal with that particular difficulty.  As the law stands, a birth certificate is admissible only as evidence of the birth and not of the family relationships.  Under section 5 of the Bill to be introduced next week such a certificate will be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein and, secondly, the Bill makes it clear that the spouse of an accused person is compellable to give evidence for the prosecution in the case of a sexual offence committed against a child.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Whips to agree to give priority to the examination of this measure and Second Stage will be taken in the House next week.  I am sure there will be full co-operation from all sides of the House in having this important Bill placed on the Statute Book at an early date.  It is non-political legislation and I hope it will be treated as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir for giving me the opportunity to ask the Minister about the maintenance of courthouses. I take the opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 the then Minister for Justice stated that the maintenance and provision of courthouses should become the responsibility of the Department of Justice <Col N="974" /> and be taken out of the remit of the Department of the Environment who fund the maintenance and provision of courthouses through the local authorities. In fact, it is worth nothing that Kilkenny County Council provided a sum of £80,000 in the estimates for 1992 for the upkeep and maintenance of courthouses. I can assure the Minister that they are a collection of ramshackle buildings throughout the county where justice is seen to be done.  I can enumerate the locations but I am sure the Minister is quite well aware of them.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Government announced in 1990 that this would come under the remit of the Department of Justice, I would be grateful if the Minister would sanction this measure as soon as possible and that it be done without any loss in the rate support grant to the local authorities.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If you insist, Deputy, to the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of most of the Dublin area, the provision and maintenance of courthouse accommodation is the responsibility of local authorities under the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935.  This arrangement has not worked satisfactorily in recent years because of the reluctance of local authorities to spend money on the courthouses.  For this reason, and also because it was considered that courthouses ought to be a central rather than a local responsibility, Government approval in principle was sought and obtained in March 1990 to transfer this financial responsibility to the Exchequer. The intention is that the State will bear the full cost of approved courthouse capital projects and recoup local authorities at least part of the running costs of the courthouses that they provide.  Unfortunately the very difficult financial situation <Col N="975" /> and the continuing need to contain public expenditure has meant that it has been possible to implement the Government decision only to a very limited extent.</P>
    <P>To date the available funds have been sufficient to enable only a small number of capital projects to be approved and it has not been possible to recoup any part of local authority expenditure on courthouse running costs.  Regrettably, there can be no change in that position for the current year.  Local authorities are accordingly expected to continue to make provision for courthouse running costs and essential repairs as heretofore.  On the plus side, however, the Minister for <Col N="976" /> Finance took a decision to write off outstanding Local Loans Fund charges with effect from 1 January 1991.  This means that any local authority which in the past and up to the end of 1990 borrowed money from the Local Loans Fund to pay for the renovation of a courthouse now has nothing more to pay back.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping the matter under consideration and under review and it is my intention to implement the Government's decision in full as soon as the financial situation permits.  I am satisfied that in due course new arrangements will lead to a significant improvement in the standard of courthouse accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 28 February 1992.</P>

      <P>In February 1987 detailed proposals for a Bill of Rights were put forward by the then Government.  The question has subsequently been raised on a number of occasions in meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference, most recently at the Conference which took place in January 1992. It has also been the subject of ongoing discussion at official level in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.</P>
      <P>In these exchanges, successive Irish Governments have made clear their support for the introduction of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  They have also drawn attention to the case made in its favour by all political parties in Northern Ireland and by organisations such as the Committee on the Administration of Justice.</P>
      <P>The British side have responded that, while they are not yet convinced of the need for a Bill of Rights, they are open to further discussion of the matter and will keep it under review.</P>
      <P>The Government are in favour of measures to enhance protection of human rights in Northern Ireland and consider that an enforceable Bill of Rights would provide valuable guarantees to members of both communities that their basic rights were protected from legislative or executive abuse.  We shall continue to press the British Government to reconsider their position on this proposal, which we believe could be particularly relevant in the context of any new arrangements which might be agreed as a result of fresh political talks.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 17, 19, 20, 60 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Single European Act, the role of the Secretariat in European Political Co-operation is to assist the member state holding the Presidency in preparing and implementing EPC activities. The secretariat is not an independent body but carries out its duties under the authority of the Presidency. Although the Commission is fully associated with the work of EPC it does not have in EPC the same functions it has under the EC Treaty, for example the sole right to make proposals, an independent power of decision, the duty of implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These arrangements reflect the different natures of the European Community and EPC.  The European Community is a supranational body whose primary objective is economic integration achieved through the actions, including legislative acts, of its institutions.  EPC is a less developed arrangement.  It falls outside the framework of the European Community as such and is governed by a separate Treaty contained in Title III of <Col N="911" /> the Single European Act.  It is an intergovernmental arrangement for consultation and co-ordination on foreign policy questions.  It does not have independent institutions like the Community's and acts primarily through the member states.  The Maastricht Treaty will strengthen the role of the Commission in the formulation and conduct of the common foreign and security policy of the new European Union.  In particular, the Commission will be given the same right to make proposals as the member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 24 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, 19 November 1991, my predecessor called in the Ambassador of Israel to express on behalf of the Government the deep sense of shock and anger felt here at the shooting dead of Corporal Michael McCarthy and the wounding of Private Richard McGrath, two Irish soldiers serving with UNIFIL in South Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> He emphasised to the Ambassador that the Israeli-sponsored militia in South Lebanon, the so-called De Facto Forces, were responsible for the killing and wounding of the Irish soldiers.  He left the Ambassador in no doubt that we deplored this unwarranted and unprovoked attack, which was the culmination of an increase of activity by the De Facto Forces in the area and against which Ireland and the United Nations had already protested.</P>
    <P>It was also impressed upon the Ambassador that Israel should comply with UN Security Council Resolution 425 and withdraw fully from Lebanon.  So long as Israel continues to provide logistical and moral support to the De Facto Forces, it must accept responsibility for the actions of these forces.</P>
    <P>The Ambassador was asked to convey to his authorities at the highest level the deep displeasure and grave concern of the Government at the killing and wounding of the soldiers.  He was further asked to clarify what action the Israeli Government intended to take to control the De Facto Forces and to prevent the recurrence of any attacks on UN peacekeeping forces.  The Government's view that the perpetrators should be brought to account and punished was also made clear.</P>
    <P>In reply, the Ambassador expressed his sympathy and regret for the incident and undertook to convey our views to his authorities.  A further response by Israel is still awaited.</P>
    <P>It was also arranged to have the incident raised at United Nations level. A special report was prepared by the Secretary-General, Perez de Cuellar, on the killing of Corporal McCarthy.  Following consideration of this report, the President of the UN Security Council issued a statement on 4 December 1991 on behalf of the members of the Council. In this statement the members of the Council conveyed their deep-felt sympathy and condolences to the Government and people of Ireland and to the bereaved families.  They expressed deep concern about the heightened tension and hostilities in the UNIFIL area of <Col N="913" /> operation and the risks to which this has exposed UNIFIL personnel as well as the Lebanese civilian population in the area; and they committed themselves to support the efforts of the Secretary-General in this regard.</P>
    <P>The statement concluded:</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the safety of members of a United Nations peace-keeping operation is endangered.  The members of the Council urgently call for restraint on the part of all concerned. </P>
    <P>Further incidents took place in the UNIFIL area of operations on 20 February. Following this, I directed that the Government's concerns about the safety and security of Irish personnel be conveyed to UN Headquarters in New York and that a protest be lodged with the Israeli Embassy in London.  Fortunately, those incidents did not result in injury to any of our personnel.  I should, however, like to express my sincere regret at the injuries suffered by Fijian soldiers in the course of the incidents.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the safety and well-being of our personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions both in Lebanon and elsewhere, who frequently have to carry out their duties in very difficult circumstances, will continue to be of paramount concern to the Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> The Maastricht Treaty text, both in the revised Articles on economic and social cohesion and in the new Cohesion Protocol, provides a solid basis for ensuring that disparities between the more developed and less developed regions will be progressively reduced.  The means available to achieve the reduction of disparities include the three existing Structural Funds, which are to be improved and made more flexible, and the new Cohesion Fund, specifically created by the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>For the Structural Funds, the whole island, North and South, is at present treated as being among the least developed regions of the Community, the so-called Objective 1 regions.  As far as the Government are concerned, there should be no change in the substantial benefit to Northern Ireland of Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds, which will continue to provide most of the Community's development finance for the rest of this decade.  If there were to be any question of changing the North's status, I would certainly oppose such a change.</P>
    <P>As regards the new Cohesion Fund, this was established at Maastricht to ease the situation of the national budgets of the poorer member states.  The important point about the Cohesion Fund is that it operates on a member state rather than a regional basis and that it is additional to the Structural Funds.  It will help the poorer member states to finance projects in the fields of the environment and transport infrastructure at a time when the rules of Economic and Monetary Union will require them to observe strict budget discipline. It will be available for member states with a <i>per capita</i> GNP that is less than 90 per cent of the Community average.  Those which fulfil this criterion are Greece, Portugal and Spain, as well as Ireland.</P>
    <P>The new Treaty, along with the Protocol, was agreed by the Heads of State or Government, and has been signed.  The question of changing it does not arise. Nevertheless, the Cohesion Fund is only one of a number of instruments in favour of cohesion.  Northern Ireland will benefit from the substantial improvements of the <Col N="915" /> Structural Funds which are set out in the new Treaty and in the Protocol on Cohesion, and from the increased levels of those funds that will follow.</P>

      <Quest>whether the EC Council of Foreign Ministers has agreed to send development aid to Cambodia; if so, when such a decision was taken and the amount of such aid to be sent, and whether any specific aid is being sent to assist the people to de-mine the country as the existence of mines is causing untold hardship to the people of Cambodia.</Quest>

      <P>The General Affairs Council, meeting on 4 November last, invited the Commission to prepare proposals on development aid for Cambodia.  Since then the Commission has engaged in consultations with other donors, including the UN agencies, in order to ensure a co-ordinated response to the need of the country.  The Commission proposals are expected to be communicated to the Council in the near future.  In the meantime, 10 million ECU in food aid was pledged on behalf of the Community on 21 January last through the UN.  This is in addition to 6.7 million ECU which the Community previously agreed to spend in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is correct in identifying the presence of landmines as a serious hardship.  They pose a dangerous hazard threatening the people of Cambodia and are a major impediment to the reconstruction of the country.  The mandate of the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC), currently preparing the ground for the larger United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), includes training in mine clearance and the initiation of the mine clearance programme.  The UN Secretary General is at present making arrangements to begin the deployment of UNTAC as a matter of urgency.  The EC Commission is co-financing an aerial <Col N="916" /> mapping project which is expected to be helpful in locating mines for clearance.</P>

      <P>The question of ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is the subject of separate questions and will be answered separately.</P>
      <P>The Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in the Nineties, and the associated plan of action, were adopted by the World Summit for Children, which was attended by the Taoiseach in New York in September of 1990.  The declaration called for action at both national and international levels.</P>
      <P>Domestically, the provisions of the declaration are being put into effect by my colleagues the Minister for Health, Education, Social Welfare and Justice, primarily through the Child Care Act.</P>
      <P>On the international level, the Government demonstrated their commitment to the aims of the World Summit for Children by significantly increasing our voluntary contribution in 1991 to UNICEF.</P>
      <P>My Department are currently implementing a series of child-related development projects under the Bilateral Aid Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of disease prevention, we have instituted a number of new Irish aid projects which will be of particular benefit to children.  These include an immunisation programme in Sudan and micro-projects to control malaria and water borne diseases in Tanzania.  Another example of our commitment is the new well-contribution programme in the Mbala District in Northern Zambia.  This project, with a budget of over £650,000 for a three year period from 1992, should help to significantly reduce children's vulnerability to cholera.  Water supply <Col N="917" /> projects in Sudan and Lesotho costing £700,000 are also under way.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, we have recently embarked under the Bilateral Aid Programme upon an ambitious programme for the rehabilitation of primary schools in the Kilosa District of Tanzania. The programme has a budget of over £442,000 for its initial two year pilot phase, 1991-93.  Following completion of the pilot phase it is intended to draw upon the lessons learned so as to prepare a more extensive programme of rehabilitation of local primary schools.</P>
    <P>The Bilateral Aid Programme is involved in the provision of primary health care in Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia.  For example, it supports a programme for the rehabilitation of maternity clinics in Lusaka, and a small anaesthetist training programme in Tanzania which contributes significantly to mother and child welfare through the provision of safe delivery at child birth.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the Government also co-financed a number of primary education and mother child health care projects with non-governmental organisations under the 1991 NGO co-financing scheme.  These include grants to the Loreto Sisters in Kenya towards the construction of a primary school in a slum area of Nairobi; to the Little Company of Mary Sisters towards the contribution of a rural health clinic in Haiti, and to the Sisters of Mercy in South Africa towards the construction of a primary school which caters for pupils from Soweto.</P>

      <P>Ireland is deeply concerned about developments in Haiti since the military coup against the country's first democratically elected President, Jean-Bertrand <Col N="918" /> Aristide, on 30 September last. We have condemned the coup and we have supported the suspension of economic assistance to Haiti under the Lomé Convention.  We have also co-sponsored a Resolution at the UN General Assembly calling for the restoration of the legitimate authorities and for full respect for human rights.  The situation of those who have been forced to flee Haiti is a matter of serious concern to the Government and to the international community.  It is being examined by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and a report on their repatriation is being prepared by him for the United Nations. While awaiting the outcome of this report we welcome the agreement signed in Washington on 23 February under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the Organisation of American States which should allow for the reinstatement of the legitimate government in Haiti and an early return to Haiti of the refugees.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government have made their views known to the Iranian authorities about the situation of the Baha'i community in Iran and, of course, have also been associated with the views expressed by the Twelve member states of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland co-sponsored the resolution on the &ldquo;Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran&rdquo;, which was adopted by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on 7 March 1991.  This resolution referred specifically among other issues to the findings of the <Col N="919" /> UN's special representative on the situation of the Baha'is in Iran.</P>
    <P>The current session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which will be meeting until 6 March, is considering the human rights situation in Iran in the light of a further report by the special representative, Mr. Galindo Pohl, which has just been published.  In this report, Mr. Pohl records that he received information that Baha'is have been required to stop educating their children in Baha'i values, that Baha'is are generally denied passports and that Baha'is continue to be discriminated against in economic matters ranging from employment in the public sector to control over their private property.</P>
    <P>Mr. Pohl has recommended that his mandate as special representative to report on human rights in Iran should be renewed for a further year.</P>
    <P>Having considered Mr. Pohl's report Ireland has decided to co-sponsor the draft resolution at the Commission on Human Rights concerning the situation in Iran.  This draft resolution provides for the renewal of his mandate.</P>

      <P>While there is no requirement on Irish citizens to register at Irish diplomatic missions or consular offices, my Department maintain close contact with our emigrants through our missions in both EC and non-EC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards present contacts, in so far as welfare issues are concerned, committees which are representative of the main emigrant groups have been set up under the auspices of the Irish Embassy in London and the Irish Consulates in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. These committees discuss the range of <Col N="920" /> problems facing our emigrants, seek to identify and publicise solutions to these problems and prepare recommendations regarding the payment of the funds allocated by the Government to assist emigrant advice groups in the various areas.</P>
    <P>In addition all our missions provide appropriate consular advice and assistance, including information about living and working conditions in their countries of accreditation, to all Irish citizens who request it.</P>
    <P>Beyond this, of course, Irish diplomatic and consular missions abroad, both within the EC and elsewhere, maintain close and regular contact with various Irish societies and cultural and social groups in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>I would envisage that the existing high level of contact will be further intensified as a result of the decision to allocate special responsibility for all emigrant issues falling within my Department's remit to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.  I am confident that this step will be widely welcomed and indeed I recall a proposal by Deputy Deasy in February 1989 that a Minister of State should be given special responsibility in this area. It would be our intention to draw up a programme of action addressing the various issues of concern to emigrants for implementation over the period ahead.</P>

      <P>On present estimates expenditure on ODA will amount to about 0.17 per cent of GNP this year, a drop from 0.19 per cent in 1991.  Clearly we are still well short of the UN target.  I am anxious that we should make steady progress towards improving our performance.</P>

      <P>The entry of Israeli forces into Lebanon was also serious, both from the point of view of the civilian population in South Lebanon and of UN personnel, including Irish soldiers serving there.  I conveyed those concerns to the Israeli Embassy and in particular the Government's grave concern at the indiscriminate and unprovoked shelling of Irish battalion positions.  The Israeli forces have since withdrawn to their self-declared security zone in south Lebanon. The situation there has become less dangerous but remains tense.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government attach very great importance to the application of the principle that the armed forces &mdash; which include the Ulster Defence Regiment &mdash; operate only in support of the civil power in Northern Ireland, with the particular objective, as set out in the Hillsborough communique, &ldquo;of ensuring as rapidly as possible that save in the most exceptional circumstances there is a police presence in all operations which involve direct contact with the community&rdquo;.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with our partners in the European Community, has been following very closely recent developments in Ethiopia.  We are encouraged by the attempts to restore peace in a country which has endured more than 30 years of civil war; a war which not only brought immense human suffering, but also impoverished the entire country.</P>
      <P>The Twelve welcomed, therefore, the peace talks under United States auspices in London at the end of May last year. We followed with interest the national conference which took place in Addis Ababa at the beginning of July and welcomed its successful conclusion, noting with satisfaction that the Charter adopted at the conference explicitly guarantees individual human rights, including freedom of expression and association.  In congratulating President Meles Zenawi on his election, the Twelve expressed the hope that the parties and factions would join together to reach a broad consensus that would lead Ethiopia towards democracy.</P>
      <P>I shall continue to follow closely political developments in Ethiopia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with Ethiopia.  Our network of diplomatic relations, both resident and non-resident, is small and must remain so for the foreseeable future, given our limited financial and personnel resources.</P>
    <P>The European Community is committed to assisting economic and social reconstruction in Ethiopia within the framework of the fourth Lomé Convention which came into operation on 1 September 1991.  Under the Convention, the Community will make available to Ethiopia some 265 million ECU.  Ethiopia also receives both routine and emergency food aid from the Community. In 1991, this amounted to about 173 million ECU.  My Department estimates that Ireland's assessed contribution to this was in the region of IR£1.8 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to our contribution to the EC aid effort Ireland provided bilaterally a total of IR£505,000 in 1991 in allocations from the Disaster Relief fund to assist victims of the famine and conflict in Ethiopia.  This included an allocation of £90,000 to the United Nations Special Emergency Programme for the Horn of Africa.</P>
    <P>According to the latest world food programme assessment, the total emergency food aid requirement for 1992 comes to some 719,000 tonnes, of which 155,000 tonnes have already been pledged.</P>

      <P>The Government have taken a close interest in the difficulties faced by the Crossmaglen GAA Club caused by <Col N="926" /> the proximity to the club of the British Army base at Crossmaglen, which has expanded in size since the early 1970s. This expansion has involved the compulsory requisitioning of land and the ordering of rights of way across club property.  Difficulties have also arisen from the British Army's attitude to the club's own expansion plans which involved the development of a new club house and changing rooms.  As recently as autumn of 1991, the club was faced with a number of problems caused by substantial refurbishment of the British Army base at Crossmaglen.</P>
      <P>The Government are anxious to ensure that the club is in a position to function with minimum disruption to its activities and the issue has been raised repeatedly in the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference with this end in view.  The British Army have now adopted alternative access arrangements to the Army base.  In relation to last autumn's refurbishment of the base, the Government sought and received assurances that structural alterations necessitated by the refurbishment work would be fully compensated for and that rights of way required for machinery access would be only temporary.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to monitor closely developments affecting Crossmaglen GAA Club and, where appropriate, to pursue matters arising in this regard through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question I have noted reports that the legal representatives for the families of the three individuals shot dead in Gibraltar in March 1988 have, under the procedures provided for this purpose, filed papers with the European Commission on Human Rights alleging that the actions by the British Government in this case were in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. The question of referral of the case to the European Court of Human Rights is a matter for determination by the parties directly concerned in the light of the findings of the Commission on the matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second point, the question of access to evidential material of the kind referred to is a matter to be pursued with the Spanish authorities by the lawyers concerned.</P>
      <P>In relation to the third part of the Deputy's question, as has been stated previously in this House, it is not the practice of the Government to make publicly available confidential reports of this kind.</P>

      <P>I applaud the very valuable work which is being undertaken by organisations in the field of North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation.  The object of this work is to achieve better understanding and to promote reconciliation between people in both parts of Ireland, and between Ireland and Britain.  The organisations in question are endeavouring <Col N="928" /> to foster links and contacts in the economic, social, cultural and educational fields.  Some of them also play an important humanitarian role by organising holidays for people, and in particular for children, of both traditions who are living in deprived areas of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>A number of the organisations which are active in this field are assisted under subhead F of my Department's Vote. Regrettably, due to the seriousness of the present budgetary situation, the Government have been obliged to reduce this year's subhead F allocation to £115,000 as compared with £200,000 in 1991.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise, however, that the reduction in this year's allocation in no sense implies diminished appreciation, on my own part or that of the Government, of the importance and value of the work being done by the various organisations assisted.  I hope that the budgetary circumstances next year may be such as to permit a higher allocation to be made to the subhead in question.</P>

      <P>Waterford was designated by the Government as the location for a regional sports centre and a 400 metre, eight lane synthetic running track to full international standards, together with the development of the infield area, fencing, car parking area and access road has been completed with grant aid of £0.5 million from my Department.  These facilities complement the existing indoor sports centre, tennis courts and 18 hole pitch and putt course provided some years ago.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the next phase of their overall development, comprising dressing room facilities, storage accommodation and fixed terrace spectator seating adjoining the existing athletic track, for which an additional grant of £0.2 million has been allocated, are under consideration by my Department.</P>
      <P>Following examination of these proposals my Department will be in communication with Waterford Corporation. It is not possible at this stage to provide additional funding for the project.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit since 1985. In January of this year she was seen by a medical referee who expressed the view that she was capable of work.  Subsequently, it was established that the medical referee concerned had previously, in 1989, expressed the same view in this case.  His 1989 finding was overturned by an appeals officer at the time.</P>
      <P>Because of the exceptional circumstances in this case, it was decided that the January 1992 examination should not be used as a basis for a decision. Accordingly, payment of benefit was restored.  It is believed that this action relates to the reference that the person concerned was found incapable on 27 January 1992.  At no stage in the last few years was she examined by a medical referee who found that she was incapable.</P>
      <P>A new medical refree examination was arranged involving a doctor who had not previously examined the person concerned. After a thorough examination the medical referee expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. On the basis of this report, the deciding officer disallowed the claim with effect from 2 March 1992.</P>
      <P>It is open to the person concerned to appeal the decision to disallow her claim to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
