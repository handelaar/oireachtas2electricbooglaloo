    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call the Deputies in the order their requests were submitted to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 on a matter of extreme importance, namely, the plans to press ahead with the ending of 24-hour accident and emergency services in Ennis General Hospital.  There is chaos at Limerick Regional Hospital this week where there is a large number of patients on trolleys, 28 on Monday morning, 17 on Tuesday and 21 yesterday.  Limerick Regional Hospital will not be able to cope with the extra patients from Ennis and Nenagh.  Talks have collapsed between the unions and the Health Service Executive.  There is no agreement with GPs and we have no details of what additional resources will be made available to the ambulance service.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children gave a commitment that 24-hour accident and emergency services would not be removed from Ennis if the resources were not in place.  As the resources are not in place the Minister must immediately re-examine the decision to close 24-hour accident and emergency services in Ennis from Monday next.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss an urgent and specific matter of public interest, namely, concern by carers groups that their limited entitlements would be targeted in the forthcoming budget.  Carers work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  There are approximately 150,000 carers across the country playing a vital role in community health care and it is estimated that in providing those services carers are saving the Exchequer in the region of &euro;2 billion annually.  They are performing a considerable service to their families, the community and to the country and it would be foolhardy in the extreme to tinker with their payments.  I therefore request an urgent debate to discuss this serious matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that carers who look after a relative in the home and the people they care for are not adversely affected by the proposed cutbacks in the health service.</P>

	<P>In respect of <i>a</i>7, I note that 35 minutes are allocated for the debate on the funding of horse and greyhound organisations next Wednesday.  With respect, there should be a longer period allocated for that debate.  Is it on Wednesday or Thursday?</P>

	<P>Is the proposal to amend the time slot from 35 minutes to 60 minutes agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals to take Nos. <i>a</i>7, 7, 8, 9 and 10 without debate agreed?  Agreed.  I call Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Does the T&aacute;naiste have in her possession the Exchequer return figures to be published today and out of courtesy to the House will she announce what they are?  Things seem to be deteriorating.  The implications of food lines in Dublin speak for themselves.  Bord na M&oacute;na has announced that it is unable to pay the defined benefit pension to its workers, some of whom have spent 40 years in the bogs.  Despite the Labour Court recommendation in respect of SR Technics, a number of workers are to be let go tomorrow.  Will the T&aacute;naiste extend a courtesy to the House and tell us what the Exchequer return figures are?  They will be published later today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As the House is aware, the Exchequer returns will be published this afternoon.  They are not yet available and I do not have them in my possession.  As indicated by the Taoiseach yesterday afternoon, the decline in the tax receipts evident in January and February of this year has also continued into March.  I do not have the figures available and they will not be published until 4 p.m. or 4.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they on the Internet?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two matters.  First, members of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland are protesting outside the House this morning in connection with the failure of the Government to honour a commitment given that a unit would be provided for sufferers of cystic fibrosis at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  The promise was that the unit would be provided in 2010, but the Government has reneged on that commitment.  Does the Government intend to honour the commitment it gave that the unit would be provided by 2010?</P>
        <P>Second, the committee which has been dealing with the issue of the protection of children sent a report to the House on 8 September 2008 and recommended that legislation be presented by Government to the House to legislate for the protection of children.  The committee recommended specifically that the legislation should be presented in the following parliamentary session, which would have been the session between September and Christmas.  The legislation did not and has not yet appeared.  When will it be presented to the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to the cystic fibrosis unit, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, indicated that she is looking at innovative ways in which we can ensure the delivery of this valuable project in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  She is working with the relevant authorities to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>She is trying to get the private sector to pay for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about innovative ways through which something that is extremely important can be delivered.  I am sure the people outside the House could not care from where it comes, as long as it comes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should keep its promises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the clear intention of the Minister and Government to follow through on it.  On the second issue, was the Deputy asking about the child care Bill?  That is due this session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I was talking about the legislation for the protection of children.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="470"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, an extension was given to the committee to examine the matter further.  We are not in a position to indicate when that legislation will be forthcoming.  Did the Deputy want to know about the child care Bill or the referendum on children?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know when we can expect the legislation that is to take place instead of the referendum, as recommended by the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the issue of the dissemination of soft information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That has not been decided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response to Deputy Gilmore on the issue of the Government&rsquo;s current position regarding the cystic fibrosis unit promised for St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  In the course of the Order of Business yesterday, the Taoiseach responded to my colleague Deputy Ferris by stating: &ldquo;We will see what we can do.&rdquo;  Will the T&aacute;naiste elaborate on what is being considered?  When will we have clarity as to the Government&rsquo;s intention regarding this most important facility for people with cystic fibrosis?  Given the extent of the concern, will the T&aacute;naiste advise the House as to what exactly the Taoiseach referred?</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children announced the establishment of yet another expert group on the allocation of resources for the health services.  She also published terms of reference for this so-called expert group which are totally inadequate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is.  I am coming to that.  The key point is that the terms of reference do not require the expert group to address one of the most fundamental and significant failings within the health services, namely, the continuation of the two-tier system of health care delivery.  Will the terms of reference be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Does the Government intend to have the terms of reference of this expert group debated in the Chamber?  The Minister has indicated that this expert group is not to report until April 2010.  Will that be used as a further excuse for the delay of many years in bringing forward the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill? That Bill has been long delayed.  Is this just another excuse to leave it until beyond April 2010?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reiterate what has been said about the cystic fibrosis facility.  We are examining ways in which this will be delivered.  There is no proposal to discuss the terms of reference for the expert group in the House.  The Minister announced that the matter will be examined under the chairmanship of Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane.  It is extremely important that the work is ongoing.  I beg the House&rsquo;s pardon, I meant Francis Ruane.  Northern Ireland is in my head.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane might do a very good job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it was looking at the Deputy that caused me to name her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>She is also from Mayo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not easy.  It is an international thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not.  It is a Northern Ireland thing.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="471"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms of reference have been agreed by the Minister and Government and the group is proceeding.  I am sure that when the group makes its recommendations in 2010, there will be ample time to discuss the outcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the eligibility for personal and social services Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no date for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the grave difficulties in the agricultural area, where 50% of REPS farmers have still not been paid &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy something relevant to the Order of Business to raise?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>This is very relevant.  Dairy and beef farmers are losing significantly.  When will we have a full debate on agriculture in the House or can the T&aacute;naiste organise that?</P>
        <P>I reluctantly welcome the comments of my colleague, Deputy Breen, on Ennis hospital, because they prove Ennis hospital is in the same situation as Monaghan hospital and they have been misinformed on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not in order on the Order of Business.  The Deputy should raise the issue in an Adjournment debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>We have raised this matter on the Adjournment, but we are sick, sore and tired&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is the Deputy cannot raise the issue on the Order of Business.  Is a debate on agriculture promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but I am sure it could be arranged with the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>What I want is honest, straightforward information on health.  A health information Bill has been promised, but every time we ask about it, we are told it will be in the future.  We want honest information now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter of a debate on agriculture could be discussed by the Whips.  The health information Bill will be later this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the Chair&rsquo;s assistance.  It is a fundamental right of Members to ask questions of Ministers and to get whatever information the Minister has on the issue.  It is a mainstay of democracy that we have that right in this House.  I asked the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, a parliamentary question, code No. 13421/09, on 31 March.  The Minister chose to ignore the question I asked and responded with a whole lot of waffle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>They all do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, the Chair has no control over answers given to Deputies. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a fundamental matter.  Recently, the Ceann Comhairle wrote to Ministers, arising particularly from the attitude of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to the House, asking them to answer the questions they are asked.  The Minister for <Col N="472"/>Transport, in his usual arrogant and contemptuous manner, has again ignored both the Ceann Comhairle and the rules of democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy want me to explain the answer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not give me the answer.  He is an arrogant man.  He ignored my question completely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy obviously feels strongly about this matter, but we must find another way of dealing with it.  I call Deputy Brian Hayes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an expectation today that the ECB will cut its interest rate, which will be good news for many people on variable rate mortgages.  However, those on fixed rate mortgages are now being charged between &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000 to switch to a variable rate mortgage.  Given the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s responsibility to the House for consumer affairs and the recent recapitalisation of the new pillars of society, namely, the banks, will she use her good offices to ensure that people will not be screwed, as they currently are, for attempting to reduce their monthly mortgage repayments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows full well he will have to find another way to pursue this important issue.  The Deputy should ask his question on legislation or seek to change the rules pertaining to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the context of what will happen today, will the T&aacute;naiste state when the consumer and competition Bill is likely to be before the House?  Will she assure us that the recapitalised, bailed out, nationalised banks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not allowed to make speeches on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will give some comfort to people who want to switch from a fixed rate mortgage to a variable rate mortgage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are appropriate ways of dealing with such matters.  The T&aacute;naiste on the consumer and competition Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The position on the consumer and competition Bill is that my Department intends to amalgamate the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority and also reform and amend the Competition Act.  The Deputy&rsquo;s point has nothing to do with this but I do not disagree that it is very important.  In all our consultation with the banks, and with reference to all our portfolios, these issues have been mentioned on an ongoing basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Mentioned&rdquo; is great news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Today some carers are coming to make their case on the circumstances in which they find themselves.  These are the people who look after the elderly, the sick and children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask an appropriate question.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="473"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">They feel they are under attack and are very concerned that the forthcoming budget may undermine their position further.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure that the status of carers is recognised in law?  The health (miscellaneous provisions) (No. 2) Bill should acknowledge in law the valuable health care and social care that carers provide to those who need it, such that their interests will be protected into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That subject is not part of the health (miscellaneous provisions) (No. 2) Bill.  That Bill will be introduced later this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>On promised legislation, in light of the fact that an employer in County Roscommon who has been supplying local authorities with safety equipment for many years has now received information from Cork County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>There is legislation, namely, the local government Bill.  Many small businesses around the country have been supplying local authorities for many years without any problem whatsoever.  The additional conditions pertaining to turnover are now being imposed on them and will actually put them out of business.</P>

It is to regulate property management companies, particularly the rogue management companies and agents operating in the market, so many of whom, unfortunately, are in my constituency.  When will this Bill be before the House?</P>
        <P>In light of the collapse in the property market, can the T&aacute;naiste compel insurance companies to reduce their premiums, mainly because the value of houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>

	<P>I will assist the Chair.  When SR Technics lost its contract the relevant Ministers, my predecessor, the Minister for Transport and the Taoiseach were involved with the unions and SRT to facilitate the smaller contracts which were carried out.  All of us in this House knew that arising from the loss of the large base maintenance contract that SRT would face huge difficulties.  My agencies had been working with SRT and continue to do so.  During the intervening period, arising from all of our concerns about the long-term viability of SRT after it lost the contract, my agencies worked with management.  I met it on three occasions.  The IDA was working with it until last Christmas to facilitate it in the reorientation of its business plan.  This work arose on the basis of our <Col N="477"/>concerns about the full-time viability of the company.  I know Deputy Broughan is aware of this because the unions were a part of process.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, at the beginning of this year the company in Zurich decided that it would not continue with SRT and, as we all know, it decided to close the company.  However, it is important to state that the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the team put together under my agencies are working continuously with a number of people who have a keen interest in taking on this company and those discussions are ongoing.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;That , pursuant to Standing Order 130 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, the Broadcasting Bill 2008 be recommitted to the Select Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is important that we take seriously the requirement of the Government to ensure that whatever new structures are put in place, they will not be cumbersome, inefficient and expensive.  If we proceed with the structure that is proposed in this Bill to set up a broadcasting authority, that is exactly what we will get.  At a time when we need lean government, we will get bloated government in the area of broadcasting.  That would be an opportunity lost.</P>
        <P>The structures proposed in this Bill would put an unnecessary financial burden on broadcasters at a time when they must cope with major cutbacks due to plummeting advertising revenues.  Telecommunications regulatory and licensing matters are currently handled by ComReg, whereas broadcasting regulation licences will be the responsibility of this new authority.  There are now many instances in which these functions overlap and there have been major changes even in the past year.  For example, there have been changes in video on demand and mobile broadband.  As the technology advances, it is up to the regulators to adapt also and reflect the convergences that are already in train.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a converged age, many of the issues facing the communication sector transcend the old boundaries, and therefore need a converged response.  This brings financial benefits with it.  For example, the converged UK regulator means that there is one regulator dealing with telecommunications and broadcasting.  This new system has benefited from lower operating costs since its establishment in 2003.  Ofcom&rsquo;s budget for 2004 and 2005 was, on a like for like basis, 5% less than the combined budgets of its predecessors.  During the year, it reduced its costs by 5%.  That kind of model is what we need in Ireland.  I regret the fact that the Minister appears to be blind to the necessity to think again in terms of meeting today&rsquo;s needs, and not to reflect on a report that was issued in 2002.  Time moves on and technology leaps on, yet we have a Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am being brief.  It is quite a complex issue, but it is very important.  I appreciate that the Leas Ceann Comhairle has given me a moment.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s letter to me on this issue reiterated the old argument.  If he is open to today&rsquo;s needs, then I urge him to support this motion.  It seems to me that he is trapped in his Department.  He has an agile mind and he understands the industries we are talking about, yet he is caught in this stasis at a time when we need appropriate thinking, lean and keen government and appropriate structures of regulation.</P>
        <P>If we proceed with this Bill, we will end up with two parallel organisations.  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is already costing a lot of money.  In one year its cost went from &euro;6.6 million to &euro;7.2 million.  That kind of spending in the overall requirements of the Government may be quite small, but in order to ensure that we get efficient governance, it does matter.  I <Col N="485"/>urge the Minister to accept this motion so that we can address the issues as convergences occur.  We need a converged regulator to meet the needs of today and the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy McManus and what she says.  The Minister may recall that I raised this issue on Second Stage.  What we are proposing to do in Ireland does not seem consistent with what many other countries across Europe are doing, with the best example being our closest neighbour.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the delivery of broadcasting services is changing, as the Minister has conceded many times.  He often watches the news via his computer screen because he is not home on time for the &ldquo;Nine O&rsquo;Clock News&rdquo;.  We are rapidly entering a period in which people will be able to access various broadcasting services on demand through next generation broadband connections, whether fibre or mobile, as in the case of many people in rural Ireland.  The regulatory model should take account of this convergence.  The idea that there should be two large regulatory structures, one regulating telecommunications infrastructure and operations and the other, a new structure which we are setting up in quite a complex way to regulate broadcasting, whether radio, television or digital, should perhaps be reconsidered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate that the Minister&rsquo;s officials and the Department have put a great amount of time and work into the legislation and I expect him to reject the motion, but that is not a good reason to proceed.  There is a fundamental idea which Deputy McManus and I hold, that is, circumstance and technology are overtaking the work we do and we should be agile and flexible enough to respond to that.  There is a great deal of sense in proposing an alternative regulatory model for broadcasting that could merge the regulators of broadcasting, telecommunications and, perhaps, other regulatory systems.  These could be merged into one larger, streamlined, more efficient regulator.  I am pleased to support the recommital motion, although it means more time and work for all of us should the Minister accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not reject the idea out of hand because serious consideration should be given to the regulatory structures given the technological changes and the convergence between the computer, broadcasting and telecommunications industries.  I accept there is an argument in that regard.  However, in respect of the correspondence from Deputy McManus and the motion before the House, in the past two years and for some time before I have come to the conclusion that it is not best for us at present to establish a single regulatory system for both broadcasting and telecommunications.  There are real concerns with respect to such a move and there is a possibility the broadcasting sector could be swamped.  The economic importance of the telecommunications sector is approximately &euro;4 billion whereas the figure for the broadcasting sector is only in the order of one eighth of that figure.  There is a real risk and concern that the interests of one industry could tend to get ahead of the other.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The broadcasting industry does not believe that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the position as far as I can see.  We will keep the matter under review and consider the synergy to be gained.  Let us consider what would have to be done were there to be such a unified regulatory system.  One would have to consider everything in the Bill, including all the provisions, such as those related to codes, right of reply, or structures in RTE.  All of the detail of the Bill would be still required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a certain urgency with the matter because it has taken some time to get the Bill to this stage.  While I can appreciate the argument and understand some of the thinking behind it, at this stage that is not the correct or appropriate step to take.  We do not envisage a great, new bureaucratic structure.  Such are the constraints and difficulties at present that the proposed new regulatory system will not have substantial additional resources, or will not be able to <Col N="486"/>consider major additional costs to be applied to the broadcasting sector via these levies.  It must be a very efficient, tight service which builds on the successes that existed in the past 20 years.</P>
        <P>Recently, I attended the annual event for broadcasters.  Let us consider the introduction of local radio stations, some 20 of which were founded in 1988.  The sector has been a significant success and one reason for this has been the success of the independent regulatory system.  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, its standards, its logic and the thinking it has applied in terms of standards and licensing has worked well.  The system has worked and continues to work well.  I support the system by recognising that work and reconfiguring the commission into a new authority, by giving it additional powers over the public service broadcasters, additional codes and additional systems that it must manage.  I am confident it can manage these changes.  Given that it works well, I believe our current structures are right and appropriate and not something I intend to turn upside down.</P>

I understand Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s concern was that the word &ldquo;sectoral&rdquo; might not be read as encompassing the impact of such a proposed activity on commercial broadcasters.  The proposed definition makes it clear that the phrase &ldquo;sectoral impact&rdquo; will be read as meaning the impact of a proposed activity on the provision of broadcasting services generally.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 17, line 4, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;shall be estimated and planned by the Minister on a multi-annual basis and&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The amendment raises very important issues in respect of the costs of setting up this quango.  I propose that the costs of administration should be estimated and planned by the Minister on a multi-annual basis.  It creates some certainty, especially for broadcasters, which are expected to have an input in financial terms.  It also sets a certain requirement on the Minister to ensure there is cost containment.  Earlier, I made the point that this is not the way to proceed nor is it cost effective.  However, if the Minister is proceeding in this direction he should at least have a multi-annual estimation of the cost.  He promises rather vaguely that it will be efficient, but he does not tell us how so.  This is merely a small measure in that regard.  How much does he expect it to cost in its year of establishment and how much will the State coffers be required to fund?  Has the Minister met an bord snip nua and has this matter been discussed?  We live in times when people cannot get an indoor toilet because there is no money in the kitty for disabled persons grants and when children cannot afford school books, yet the Minister will create an unnecessary body that will cost a great deal of money.  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, which has fewer duties, cost &euro;7.2 million in previous years.</P>
        <P>We live in different times and Ministers must justify every decision.  How much money are we discussing?  If the new body will be the same as the BCI, why should the latter be replaced?  If the new body will not be the same, the duties contained in the Bill indicate that greater costs and expertise and further structures in the form of committees will be required.  What is the likely budget and can the Minister ensure that it will be planned, as this would provide people directly affected by the quango&rsquo;s running costs with certainty?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="488"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On cost and given the constraints on public service numbers, a quantum increase in resources or budgets will not be available.  While this is a difficulty for regulators and other agencies, it is the environment in which we work.  The process outlined in the Bill will transfer the cost from the Exchequer to the industry.  While this will place an additional burden on the industry, it is common practice for regulators.  For example, the energy regulator, CER, is provided with funding through a similar industry provision, as is ComReg.</P>
        <P>This method is of benefit as it does away with the annual budgetary process and it provides certainty not only to the agency, but also to industry in the form of its involvement.  Under section 37(1), the agency must publish a three-year estimate of its expenditure.  Given the fact that the agency will be funded by broadcasters, it is expected that the agency will provide them with advance notice of developments in the levy.  This is a normal business practice that works well within our other regulatory systems.</P>
        <P>I cannot accept the amendment, although I understand its basis.  Section 4 is a standard provision that appears in most Acts.  As the Bill requires that advance notice in the form of a three-year plan be given, however, a generic provision would not be appropriate.</P>
        <P>Regarding an bord snip or whatever its real title is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and reform of public service numbers, it is due to enter into discussions with my Department next week.  It will also consider broadcasting.  We must determine whether we can include other content services so as to improve efficiencies.  In this light and given the range of content regulation, we must determine whether we can amalgamate some of it to provide a better system.</P>
        <P>We are reviewing everything.  On an ongoing basis, we are considering how to connect the telecommunications network side with the content side.  The outcome will not be as major a shift as the Bill constitutes, but the two agencies involved can be fine-tuned and integrated in a number of ways.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of points on section 4.  Will the Minister be clearer?  Will the implementation of this legislation cost the State anything?  He referred to the expenses that will be incurred by the Minister in the legislation&rsquo;s administration.  If the cost will not be zero, what will it be?</P>
        <P>I will wait for the debate on the levy to discuss it.  Just so that everyone is clear, how much will the industry need to pay for the establishment this year of the new structure?  Presumably, the Department has estimated the cost.  The Minister used the example of the telecommunications industry financing ComReg.  As he stated, telecommunications is a multi-billion euro industry, but it is in a different place from broadcasters, particularly given the collapse in advertising revenues.  The telecommunications industry has a different capacity to pay, as does the energy industry, some generators in which are too comfortable.  Broadcasting is different in terms of its revenue and the pressures on it.  If the Minister answers some of my questions, we will make progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 4 is a general provision of typical drafting convention.  For example, payments to TG4 could be managed in terms of its levy contribution.  During the establishment this year, the Exchequer&rsquo;s contribution versus the industry&rsquo;s will depend on how quickly we can do our business, which has been delayed for a number of weeks by the various emergency banking and pension levy legislation passed by the House.  This year&rsquo;s cost to the industry will depend on how quickly the D&aacute;il gets its business done, the Bill goes to the Seanad and is enacted and the agency is up and running.  If all of that takes half or three quarters of <Col N="489"/>the year, the industry&rsquo;s contribution will be &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million while the Exchequer will make up the balance.  The Exchequer will incur the main costs in the authority&rsquo;s establishment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not understand what the balance will be.  Of what will the Exchequer make up the balance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The balance of the estimated cost of running the BCI and the authority this year as one evolves into the other.</P>
        <P>Regarding the industry&rsquo;s contribution, I recognise that it is a difficult time for broadcasters in that the advertising market has been dramatically reduced.  However, good regulation will benefit the industry.  To use a sporting analogy, both teams playing a football match on a Sunday morning pay the referee.  It is a relatively small charge and makes sense for both teams, as there will be a better match and good regulations and rules.  A number of broadcasters recognise that some of the stringent standards applied by the BCI in the past 20 years have worked to their advantage by maintaining standards and ensuring a fair playing pitch, which is important if players are to be prevented from dominating the market and if single media ownership, one of a range of eventualities, is to be avoided.  The return on the levy will be of benefit to providers.  It should be a small cost as a percentage of overall budgets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should give the House a break.  No one is arguing against regulation or standards.  The Minister is establishing a costly body, although that is a guess because the Minister seems unable to provide us with even a ballpark figure of how much it will cost.  Will it cost &euro;7.2 million or &euro;10 million?  Broadcasters are on their knees.  RTE and TV3 are struggling with large holes in their revenue.</P>
        <P>If the Minister is talking about a referee on a football pitch, I am unsure whether he is in the real world.  I imagine that at some point, he may be obliged to face the fact that an inability to pay scenario has arisen.  At present, the Minister has not outlined how much this will cost.  However, he has stated the burden will fall on the broadcasting sector even though everyone is aware that it is under ferocious pressure at present.</P>
        <P>As for staffing this new body, will additional staff be taken on at a time when people are unable to gain access to special needs assistants, nurses or palliative care nurses?  Will this happen or will a form of embargo be extended to this new structure?  How many people will be employed, how much will it cost and what is the justification for levying the broadcasting sector?  While I ask these questions of the Minister now, I suspect they will also be asked of him during his discussions with an bord snip nua.  We now are in a different world and to carry on blithely as though another body simply could be created has a touch of empire-building about it.</P>
        <P>Everyone desires standards in broadcasting and recognises the need for regulation, but that is not the issue.  Such regulation and standards must be achieved in a cost-effective and efficient manner and the Minister is not reassuring Members in this regard, at a time when the public seeks reassurance that the Government is listening and taking on board the fact that we are in an economic crisis and cannot afford to continue with business as usual.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Briefly, the budget figures are closer to the first figure given by the Deputy rather than the latter, that is, they are closer to &euro;7 million than to &euro;10 million.  The cost this year to the broadcasters will depend on when the agency  is established.  This is not a time in which I will be able to provide massive additional resources in respect of staffing or <Col N="490"/>finance.  At present, I understand there are approximately 36 full-time equivalent employees working in the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.  They will be obliged to take on additional roles and seek efficiencies in their systems to be able to do this within existing resources.  This may be helped if we can use other content provision within the State and can achieve greater efficiencies in that fashion.  In addition, the manner in which my Department works with the new authority may bring greater efficiencies.</P>
        <P>Moreover, this Bill provides greater clarity and ease in the management of this process.  It will update and improve the regulatory system with a range of innovations in respect of the types of right to reply systems, complaint systems and commissioning systems that are available and they will bring efficiencies because this constitutes a modernisation and update of our regulatory system, which is the right thing to do.  Despite the difficult downturn, this is exactly what should be done because I believe it will make it easier for broadcasters.  The right to reply system included in this Bill is innovative and will keep everyone out of the courts, in which massive costs and delays are incurred.  Through this legislation, Members can do a favour for the industry and help them through a difficult time.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have tabled amendments Nos. 8 and 73 for clarity in respect of the new process of board appointments that is proposed under this legislation.  Amendment No. 8 relates to the board of the BAI while amendment No. 73 relates to the boards of RTE and TG4.  Subsections (1) and (2) of sections 8 and 81 are being changed to make the process to be followed by the Minister in respect of the appointments of board members, where the Oireachtas joint committee has a role, more transparent.  The amendment provides that the Minister will inform the Oireachtas joint committee of the nominees by him or her, together with details as to the relevant experience and expertise.  This will allow the Oireachtas joint committee to consider the type of skills mix and expertise of the proposed nominees it wishes to put to the Minister and enable it to decide on nominees which it considers would balance and complement the overall team.  While the requirement for the Minister to have regard to the advice of the Oireachtas joint committee stands, there may be instances in which the Minister cannot accept the proposed nominees and this amendment brings drafting clarity to that possibility, as advised by Parliamentary Counsel, allowing the Minister to nominate other persons as he or she sees fit.  The Minister is required to inform the Oireachtas joint committee of any decision relating to such appointments.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 14, 15, 74 and 75, which I have tabled, are consequential amendments that arise from the recasting of the relevant subsections.  Amendments Nos. 19 and 79 are minor amendments that are proposed for clarity, while amendment No. 18 is a minor drafting amendment consequent on an amendment from Deputy McManus that was accepted on Committee Stage.  I propose in amendment No. 78 to make the process regarding board appointments to the public service broadcasters consistent with the BAI process with regard to the publication of details of board membership and terms of office in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.</P>
        <P>Turning to the Opposition amendments, I will begin with amendments Nos. 9 and 13 tabled by Deputy Coveney, which deal with procedures in respect of appointment of board members of the BAI.  Amendment No. 9 proposes that rather than the model contained in the Bill, whereby five members are nominated by the Minister and four members are nominated by the advice of the Oireachtas joint committee, all members are nominated by the Minister but are then subject to an approval hearing and vote at the Oireachtas joint committee.  Members dealt with this issue at length on Committee Stage and I retain my preference for the approach set out in the Bill.  As I have explained previously, it allows the Oireachtas joint committee the <Col N="492"/>opportunity to propose board members and obviously its own internal discussions will ensure the suitability of such members, as well as leaving the Minister of the day to select five members.</P>
        <P>As I noted previously, it is particularly appropriate that there be balance and transparency in respect of board appointments, especially for boards dealing with broadcasting matters in which the organisations involved play key roles in ensuring media pluralism reflecting the democratic nature of the State.  I believe my amendments already discussed bring further clarity to the process and commit the Minister and members of the Oireachtas joint committee to a genuine and purposeful discussion.  This proposed approach requires genuine participation between the Minister and the Oireachtas joint committee in the selection of candidates, rather than one that could lead to confrontation.  For that reason, I cannot accept amendment No. 9 and, therefore, neither can I accept amendment No. 13, which is an associated follow-on from it.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, tabled by Deputy Coveney, propose representation from the disability sector and consideration of industry, technical and consumer affairs experience in the nomination of BAI board members.  Amendment No. 16 tabled by Deputy McManus proposes that the BAI should include members with experience in certain specific areas.  Amendment No. 76 proposes the same for public service broadcasters.  In general, these areas of expertise are already identified in sections 9(1) and 82(1), among many others, as areas in which board appointees may be experienced.  In general, I am opposed to sectoral appointees to boards.  While board members should be generally qualified for board membership and should be from diverse backgrounds, I do not believe they should perceive their role on boards as a narrow representation of one group.  Therefore, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 16 and 76 or amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 17 and 77 tabled by Deputy McManus deal with the issue of whether it is appropriate for board members to serve more than two terms.  The legislation currently intends that in the case of both the broadcasting authority of Ireland and public service broadcasters, no one will serve more than two terms.  Given that the proposed maximum term for each appointment is five years, this potentially will allow board members to serve for up to ten years.  That is a sufficient period and I believe that changes in board membership should occur periodically.  As a decade appears to me to constitute a reasonable period, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 17 and 77.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 21 proposes to remove section 19(2), which is a subsection that restricts the chief executive officer from discussing the merits of Government policy while attending the Committee of Public Accounts.  I cannot accept this amendment as the restriction on comments as to the merits of Government policies is a standard one in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts, the purpose of which is to focus on reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General and the use of resources and expenditure generally and on financial matters, and not on other issues.  I should point out that no such restriction is proposed in the legislation in respect of section 20, which deals with attendance and accountability pertaining to other Oireachtas committees.</P>

	<P>First, on a procedural issue, Members are discussing too many amendments together at once as a number of themes must be discussed.  The first of these is how we select, elect if necessary and approve the new board, from the point of view of the broadcasting authority of Ireland, the so-called corporation, RTE, and the compliance committees.  I want to address this first, then consider whether we should have board members from sectoral interests.  I hope the Acting Chairman will allow me to contribute a number of times on this group of amendments, otherwise I will stay on my feet and go through them all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair will be as helpful as possible but there are restrictions on me.  I will do my best.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not be difficult on this matter.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the Minister has shown initiative in changing the way the Government selects boards.  Many people are rightly cynical about the way State board appointments are made.  It is far too political and based on political preferences and background.  There have been many cases of preferential treatment and that should not be the case.  This is an example of an important decision-making body that must be selected and appointed on the basis of the knowledge, talent and intelligence required for a broadcasting authority.  The Minister is trying to take politics out of the appointment process to a certain extent.</P>
        <P>As I said on Committee Stage, the Minister has gone about this the wrong way.  The role of an Oireachtas committee is not to start selecting a panel of proposed people on whom the Minister can make a decision; rather, it is to hold the Minister to account on his decisions.  The role of the Minister is to make decisions on behalf of the Government in a non-partisan political way and for that decision to be tested by an Oireachtas committee to ensure it is fair and non-partisan.  That is how I see my role as an Opposition spokesperson.  If I am lucky enough to be in the Minister&rsquo;s position I will happily take on the responsibility of making these choices and I will happily be tested to ensure I am not abusing my position as Minister and decision maker.</P>
        <P>I suspect I will not be successful in this because of what the Minister said but I would like the Department to do the research to find the best people in the country for this role.  I would then like the Minister to bring this team of people before an Oireachtas committee and allow Deputy McManus and other committee members to interview the team and discuss the role of the new broadcasting authority of Ireland.  At the end of the process, which will not be the witch-hunt that some suggest, we would vote to give approval to the overall board.  This is similar to what the European Parliament does when it approves the panel of Commissioners appointed every five years.  It is a system that works.  I do not say that we should vote against individual appointments, we should judge the Minister on his overall team and cast a vote.  The Government will have a majority on the committee anyway and, therefore, there is no danger the committee would vote against the board unless the Minister makes an awful hash of it.  However, it would give us the opportunity to expose those who should not be there.  That would be a far braver stand by the Minister than what he proposes, even though I recognise this is a significant change.  It does not make the change in a courageous way.  The Minister, on behalf of the Government, will nominate a majority on the board and, in listening to what Opposition parties say, he will allow the Oireachtas committee to propose a panel from which to appoint a minority of the new authority.  At no point in the process will the majority or the whole team of the authority sit before a committee and outline their suitability for the job.  That is wrong.  If we are to reform State appointments in broadcasting, let us do it right.  The Minister will get a responsible approach from me and my party in respect of the appointments the Minister makes.</P>
        <P>I welcomed the appointment of many of the people on the new board at RTE.  They are good people and they would have passed an Oireachtas hearing system with flying colours.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.  In the absence of my proposal being successful I will play my role in the new structure proposed by the Minister, but it is not as transparent and accountable as what I am proposing.</P>
        <P>What the Department allowed to happen after the end of 2008, in January and February 2009, whereby RTE had no board to make strategic decisions and give direction to RTE, was negligent.  I understand why this legislation has been delayed and it is not the fault of the Minister, but there was no contingency plan to deal with the reality that the board of RTE was <Col N="494"/>no longer in existence at the end of 2008.  RTE continued to operate, arguably without a stable legal basis because it had no board for more than two months before the temporary board was appointed.  We should learn lessons from that.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to address these concerns and I will then speak on the less significant issues in these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Minister has tried to do something unprecedented in including the Oireachtas committee on deliberations regarding appointments.  That is welcome but I share the view of Deputy Coveney that the approach adopted is second best.  We must have a rigorous system of accountability for Government appointments.  The Minister&rsquo;s party has found, to its cost, that the existing system can lead to unexpected perils such as what happened to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  That could have been avoided had there been a scrutiny process as is the norm in more progressive parliaments.  The Minister has been cautious and I am not sure how productive this process will be.  We will play our part but it is disappointing he did not have the confidence to do it in a way that would enable the Oireachtas committee to have a real job of accountability and scrutiny.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I agree with Deputy Coveney in respect of the RTE board.  That was inexcusable.  When I discovered what was going on I was genuinely shocked.  In statutory terms, it was unacceptable but in regard to ensuring our national broadcaster had a good strong management structure, leaving it without a board for so long either showed inexperience from the Minister or lack of consideration of the importance of RTE.  It may have been lethargy.  Will the Minister give us an explanation as it is remarkable that it would reach the point where RTE would have been unable to continue to operate with regard to annual reports etc. because the Government had not bothered to establish a board?  It would be worth knowing what went on that led to such a delay.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 16, which I put down, relates to including at least one person with specific expertise.  It relates to matters pertaining to disability and aging but also broadcasting and digital media technologies.  I understand where the Minister is coming from when he says he does not want representative people on boards but I ask him to make an exception to that rule.  Yesterday we were given a presentation in an Oireachtas committee by the umbrella organisation promoting the right to access to television and radio by people with disability.  It went right across the board and involved Age Action Ireland, representatives of people who are deaf and blind etc.  It was a very professional presentation.</P>
        <P>It seemed there should be a special status accorded to people with a disability and older people.  For them, broadcasting of radio and television has particular significance and being unable to access television or radio is a particular punishment.  We must consider the matter seriously because if we simply say that such issues are important and look to encourage broadcasters to play their part, if the resources are not there the result will be the same as what happened with the diaspora channel.  Work was done in this House to ensure access to Irish broadcasting by our diaspora and everybody agreed on it.  The Government committed to this and it was put into law but now RTE does not have the required money to do anything about it.  This can happen very easily as good intentions fall by the wayside.</P>
        <P>I was very impressed with yesterday&rsquo;s presentation and I urge the Minister, if he has not done so already, to read about the practical approach presented by the disability groups.  Even if he does not accept my amendment he should ensure that somebody is in place who is not just representing the disability constituency because that is not enough.  We must have somebody who understands the constituency, represents the people&rsquo;s needs and also has expertise in the area of digital technology and broadcasting.  All elements are required.</P><Col N="495"/>
        <P>There are considerations regarding the equipment people have and whether they can use it or if it is accessible.  One must consider how it is possible for an elderly or disabled person to access television, what happens with DTT transfers and whether people are to be left out of the loop because their televisions are too old.  These are the kind of issues that must be concentrated on all the way through the technological changes.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the fact that Britain&rsquo;s National Health Service, NHS, has a dedicated service for people who may be ill or elderly and who would normally go to their doctor or go to hospital for advice or attention.  The NHS is using broadcasting to bring information to people so that there is a saving, in effect, on doctor calls or visits to the surgery as people can access the information through their television or radio.  That is the kind of potential which exists for people at a disadvantage but that potential must be understood.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to accept the amendment as this sector is particularly reliant on broadcasting and its needs should be at the highest level to ensure they are met.  Otherwise we will end up with lip service that does not deliver in terms of meeting the needs of people with disability and older people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will first deal with the gap in the re-establishment of the RTE Authority.  Deputy Coveney indicated the Department allowed that to happen but the Minister allowed that and I take responsibility for it.  I will explain why.  As good as my Department officials are &mdash; they are very good in this area particularly &mdash; with this type of appointment it is right that it be made at a political level.  Certain decisions are better made by politicians and there are very subtle balances and decisions to be tackled regarding the mix of people, character and abilities.  I agree with Deputy Coveney that the process should not be on a partisan or party political basis, as this does not lead to the wider consideration of how people could work together on a board.</P>
        <P>The reason for the gap was simple and was not down to a lack of attention to the issue or a real sense of urgency.  Sometimes it can be very difficult to get people.  On a number of occasions in that period I was not able to get the mix of people that I initially wanted.  I had to go back to talk to a number of different people.  I cannot even give details of the people who may not have wanted to participate for different reasons but there is the issue of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Minister not continue with the previous structure until there was time to put something in place rather than create a vacuum?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I intended to close the vacuum sooner and we were ultimately able to do it.  The board is up and running and the right people are there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue remains.  There is much concern out there that putting oneself in any way in the public domain or in public service is to put oneself in a position of scrutiny, ridicule and questioning so some people are questioning whether they should go forward for public service appointments.  I have a concern with regard to the whole approach suggested by the Deputy as it relates to appointments to boards.  There is a fundamental difference of views, which have been outlined on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>It is better to have the power to propose rather than oppose.  I listened very carefully to the Deputy&rsquo;s arguments on what the Oireachtas committee would do.  His central argument was that it would have the role &ldquo;as a test of partisanship&rdquo; and the crucial job of that committee was to ensure the Minister was not being partisan in the appointments.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="496"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It should hold the Minister to account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy indicated the role&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not misrepresent me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We can look back on the record.  The Deputy indicated it would expose people who should not be there.  I disagree fundamentally as to what the opportunity is as we change the way we appoint boards.  It is far better, more powerful and more useful to give any Oireachtas committee &mdash; I would apply this to any appointment to a board because it is a fundamentally good model &mdash; to have the power to propose.  It should have the power to suggest a person, skills or a balance as appropriate to a board.</P>
        <P>The amendment came from the discussions we had on Committee Stage and accepting some of the arguments made by the Deputies.  The process we are refining with this amendment is to say that the Minister indicates which people have been appointed, their skill sets and the reasons behind their appointment.  That makes it much easier for the Oireachtas committee to round off the board and add to it with its own proposals.  That is a far more positive and progressive step than operating on a partisan basis, as the Deputy suggested could happen.  I do not see how that would add to the quality or standard of boards.  That is why I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy and why I am adhering to the approach I have outlined.</P>
        <P>Deputy McManus referred to people who are members of particular bodies or organisations.  The model for which provision is made in the Bill will provide the Oireachtas committee with the opportunity to identify people who would make excellent candidates and nominate them for membership of boards.  I agree with the Deputy that when appointing boards, we must consider whether the membership is representative of different interests throughout the country.  For example, certain boards might benefit from having people with technological expertise or those who have worked with disability groups as members.  The Oireachtas committee, as well as the Minister, will have the power to ensure that a broad mix will apply in respect of the membership of boards.</P>
        <P>An amendment was made in the Seanad in respect of the audience council to the effect that the latter must include among its members someone who represents the disability sector.  Making such a provision in respect of the audience council is correct.  However, I do not wish to restrict the broadcasting authority of Ireland or the RTE or TG4 authorities in this regard.  It is our responsibility, as politicians, to make the call in this regard.  Politicians must be representative of the people and they have a duty to establish boards that are representative.  We should take our responsibility in this regard seriously because it is one of the most important responsibilities conferred upon us.  We are sharing our power in this regard and handing it over to those on the opposite side of the House.  This will lead to the creation of a better process in respect of appointments to boards.  I look forward to working with the Deputies opposite in the context of discovering how this will operate in practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will leave the argument where it stands in the context of our difference of opinion regarding the role of committees and that of the Opposition.  I was lucky enough to have been involved in the hearings process in another parliament and was extremely impressed by it.  That was my sole motivation behind my proposal that we adopt a similar structure in Ireland.  I will endeavour to play my part in ensuring that the system proposed by the Minister will work.  I accept that there is a benefit to having the opportunity to put people forward for membership on boards as well as the opportunity to test the decisions of Ministers.  I return to the point that the majority of the members of the authority the Minister will appoint will never be tested by the Oireachtas.  It will, therefore, continue to be possible to place on <Col N="497"/>the State board in question someone who might be termed a &ldquo;dud&rdquo;, without he or she ever being exposed as such.  That is not good enough.</P>
        <P>Deputy McManus referred to the disability sector.  The Minister made a strong point to the effect that he does not wish to be overly prescriptive with regard to whether the person appointed to the board from this sector represents a sectoral area or something else.  The Minister has taken action in this regard in an absolute way in respect of gender balance.  As such, he has already established a precedent with regard to being prescriptive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support Deputy McManus in respect of the disability-access sector.  There are many people who, for a variety of reasons, have difficulty accessing broadcasting services.  While I accept the principle that we should not prescribe the exact make-up of the board in the context of sectoral interests &mdash; this would essentially request the Minister and the Oireachtas committee, in terms of their nominations, to operate within the confines of a straitjacket &mdash; an exception could be made in respect of disability-access interests to ensure that at least one board member would represent those with such interests.  In that context, amendment No. 10 in my name states that the nomination and approval process &ldquo;shall have regard to the need for gender balance and representation from the disability sector&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 73 to 79, inclusive, deal with RTE.  How does the Minister plan to proceed in this regard.  The existing RTE board has been put in place on a temporary basis.  How does he intend to add to this board?  Will he merely add further members to the existing board when the committee puts forward a panel of nominees or does he intend to establish a new board?  Will the members of the temporary board comprise a percentage of the new board or will an entirely new membership be selected?  I presume the Minister will merely add to the six people who are already in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to labour the point regarding the needs of people with disabilities.  I am aware of the Minister&rsquo;s goodwill towards this issue and I would be extremely surprised if the first authority appointed did not contain some form of representation to ensure full access for people with difficulties.  However, legislation does not relate to any particular Minister.  In view of the current climate, I do not believe it is possible to state whether the Minister, Deputy Ryan, will even be in office in 12 months&rsquo; time.  I wish him well but we cannot be certain of anything at present.  All that is certain is that the legislation, once it is passed, will endure until it is amended.  That is extremely important in the context of providing certainty.  However, it is vital that we steer the legislation in a direction which is inclusive and involves a political dimension.</P>
        <P>The Bill is not merely concerned with administration and regulation; it makes a statement with regard to broadcasting itself.  On Second Stage, I made the point that it does not contain a definition of &ldquo;public service broadcasting&rdquo;.  The Minister replied by providing a definition.  The Bill is not merely concerned with the nuts-and-bolts issues; it is designed to ensure that access will be guaranteed to people across the country and to the members of the diaspora who live beyond our borders.  One of the aims of the Bill is to ensure that certain standards are in place.  Such standards must contemplate the needs of those with disabilities or the elderly.  We can put in place all the standards we wish but if certain people are excluded, such standards will not prove adequate.</P>
        <P>Regardless of the goodwill of the Minister or the Oireachtas committee, I do not believe that the needs of people whose access to services is restricted will be met unless provision is made in legislation.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment in my name, which makes provision on a one-off basis and which will not open the floodgates.  Deputy Coveney made an interesting point with regard to gender balance, which is something to which we have all become used.  However, there was a time when one was obliged to go out on a limb when one <Col N="498"/>argued in favour of gender balance.  To an extent, one was treated as somewhat hysterical and very unreasonable when one argued in favour of gender balance.  However, that is now the norm and it no longer comes as a surprise.</P>
        <P>We must address the needs of those with disabilities.  Those needs are not acknowledged in the legislation or in the Minister&rsquo;s approach.  There must be something concrete in it to give to people who experience many difficulties, and a great deal of discrimination.  It may not be deliberate but it happens every day.  One has only to try travelling in a wheelchair to experience the difficulties that are created by the obstacles in our environment.  I urge the Minister to accept that it would be a good marker to set down that we acknowledge that people with disability and older people have special requirements that must be addressed in legislation rather than on the <i>droit du seigneur</i> of a Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the disability issue, I cite the access rules developed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland as one example of what this regulatory process costs the industry.  It is progressive and delivers in terms of the targets set to 2014 of RTE being 100% accessible in terms of subtitling and so on.  Regulators do important work to deliver on some of our ambitions regarding disability and standards that otherwise would not get addressed and would not be delivered on.  That work is a example of the good that comes out of some of the spending on these regulatory systems.  We shall see what we can do to get that onto the various boards we will have to appoint, not only the TG4 board but also the new broadcasting authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To give details on the interim board that is in place in RTE under the 1960 Act, I asked two of the members of the existing board to stay on an interim basis for this period.  They bring particular experience, especially in the finance side which will be useful because the broadcaster is in a very difficult financial position.  That knowledge will then pass on to the new authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my intention then to take the six members from that authority, along with the four members proposed by the joint Oireachtas committee, and re-establish the new authority under the new legislation as soon as it is passed.  There is a timeline around that.  We have to get our business done.  Under the legislation a three month timeframe is given and we will face a tight deadline to get the work done to establish the RTE authority as a new authority under this legislation, taking six of the members of the current interim board with the names proposed by RTE.  Also, under the legislation there will be a requirement for the staff in RTE to vote through a further member to allow the staff representative to be on the authority on that basis.  The intention is that the interim members of the board would progress on to that new authority as soon as we have the four names from the joint Oireachtas committee and the legislation is passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the clarification on the RTE board.  We should just get on and do it in order that it can get clear direction and have a full sized board with all of the expertise it is hoped that will bring.  </P>
        <P>Deputy McManus has made the point repeatedly about the need for representation of the disability sector.  I agree with everything she said in that regard.  I suspect our committee will take that into account when we nominate names for the Minister to consider, but the unfortunate aspect is that there will not always be the same relationship between an Oireachtas committee and a Minister.  In five or six years&rsquo; time we could have an entirely different political structure here, never mind political personalities, and we will not have legislation that requires representation of a person from the disability-access sector on the board.  That is a missed opportunity.  Without being overly prescriptive, the Minister has a reasonably big board to fill <Col N="499"/>and to insist that one of those members would fulfil that role is not unreasonable.  I would consider it as being more important than having a precise gender balance on the board.  We should take account of gender balance but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is skating on thin ice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We might disagree on that but whether there is the exact same representation of men and women on the board is less important than having a representative who has expertise and knowledge in this area.  We must have general regard to gender balance on the board but being exacting in that area and not being prescriptive in the area of disability is wrong.</P>
        <P>My amendment No. 13 seeks to facilitate a speedier and more efficient decision-making process when there is a vacancy on the board.  If a person must leave the board for a reason, what the Minister is proposing in the legislation is that the Oireachtas committee would meet and go through the process of making a nomination, which the Minister will either accept or reject, to fill that role.  If that happens at the start of July there will be no replacement until, say, September because the Oireachtas committee might not be able to meet to consider the matter.  If there is a vacancy on a board it is the Minister&rsquo;s job to replace that person and then go to the Oireachtas committee to inform it of the reason the person has been chosen.  In terms of going through that laborious process, and I am speaking against my own interests in Opposition, the Government must be efficient as well.  It appears to be an overly laborious process for the Oireachtas committee to go through the process of interviewing, selecting and recommending a person to the Minister before he can make the choice to accept or reject that nomination to replace one person on the board.  Should the chair of the board take ill, have an accident or have to leave because of a scandal, we do not have an efficient system to replace that person quickly, and that is a flaw.  That is the reason I propose that the Minister would take charge in that scenario, make an appointment and stand over that appointment before a committee.  This is an efficiency of Government issue also in terms of making a decision like that.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 13 which I would have expected to come from Government rather than from Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On that last point, that provision was inserted specifically in case of prospect that I might be sitting on the other side of the House at some time in the future.  I would like to retain the ability to use the facility in the legislation to be proactive and nominate people because that facility keeps this process going.  It does not hand it back to the Minister.  I would prefer to do that.  If we cannot do our business here in the Oireachtas within 90 days, in terms of getting a committee to meet, that would be a sign of our own inefficiency.  I would adhere to the way the Bill is written to give that power to the Oireachtas committee and to continue to give it after the actual foundation.</P>
        <P>There are ways in which it can be done, and these are the details we can work out in the meetings we have to decide how this process works.  If the Oireachtas committee proposes 12 names in total, there would be no problem having a list of, say, 16 to ensure there is a substitute.  If, for whatever reason, a member was not able to be on the board, the Minister would be able to choose, say, No. 13 or, two years later, if the list is still intact, it gives us the ability to do something fairly quickly.  There are ways around that issue but I am reluctant to give the power to the Minister.  I would prefer to give it to the Oireachtas committee.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 24, to delete lines 33 to 37 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(11) Subject to any rule made under <i>subsection (3)</i>, meetings of the Authority or a statutory committee shall be capable of being held by telephone or other suitable electronic means whereby all the members of the Authority or the relevant statutory committee can hear and be heard.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendments in this group relate to board procedure and accountability.  They are intended to respond to concerns raised by Deputies on Committee Stage on the working of sections 13(11) and 88(7), which provide legal certainty on the use of electronic communications media for board meetings and decision making by RTE, TG4 and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in statutory committees.  The wording proposed for the amendment is drawn from section 28(<i>n</i>) of the Heads of the Bill submitted by the Company Law Review Group in association with the report on the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in May 2007.</P>
        <P>While I hope it would not be the norm for board members to participate by telephone, there will be instances where meetings are necessary at short notice and which may only be conducted by telephone or video conference.  These amendments are necessary to ensure that any decision made in such a meeting is afforded legal certainty.  It should be noted the application of such provisions will be subject to any rules or procedures set by the organisation concerned under sections 13(3) and 88(5).</P>
        <P>With regards to amendment No. 22, sections 21 and 22 of the Bill require that members of the board, staff or contractors of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and its statutory committees must disclose any conflict of interest to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  Section 21(2) and 22(1) provide for the steps to be taken on the disclosure of a conflict of interest.</P>
        <P>Section 21(3) requires that any conflict of interest raised by a member of the board, the BAI or its statutory committees must be noted in the minutes of the meeting of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland or its statutory committees.</P>
        <P>Sections 21 and 22 do not require the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to automatically place such information in the public domain as there may be instances where to place a disclosure into the public domain would serve no public interest but would infringe on that individual&rsquo;s right to privacy.  Sections 21 and 22 as constituted are appropriate so I do not propose to accept amendment No. 22.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I am suspicious at the idea of meetings of an important authority being conducted by telephone.  We should stick with the old ways.  If there is an emergency meeting that must be conducted by telephone, must every person on the authority be contacted and able to participate?  Only a quorum is necessary for a meeting.  I would be uncomfortable that a meeting could be held using the quorum to validate it if the meeting was being conducted by telephone.</P>
        <P>The amendments that are grouped together are supposed to relate to each other.  When the Leas-Cheann Comhairle announced this group, he stated that the amendments are related but there is no relationship between amendment No. 22, which concerns disclosure, and amendments Nos. 20 and 81.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="502"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wishes to dis-aggregate them, that is fine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to labour the point but I want to inform those who compile the grouping that the form of grouping used through this Bill is incredibly difficult, mainly because so many amendments have been bundled together.  In this instance, even though there are only a few amendments, they should not have been bundled.  We are not being well served in terms of the work we must do when there is such aggregation.</P>
        <P>In the interests of accountability I ask the Minister to look again at the amendment.  It states that where there is a conflict of interest, it would be recorded in an accessible manner.  If someone has a conflict of interest and declares it, I do not see a problem.  The amendment is formulated in a way whereby if someone is found to have a conflict of interest that was not declared, it can be addressed.  It simply formalises the requirement of a member of the authority to declare a conflict.  Putting a register in place would assist good practice because we have had bad experiences here.  This is an extra safeguard and I am disappointed the Minister is not proceeding with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 20 is a response to my concern on Committee Stage at the possibility that board meetings could be held where people telephone to give a decision on a question.  It is open to abuse in difficult decisions where the board is split.  To be fair the Minister has tried to address this concern.  In the unlikely event there is not a full attendance at the board meeting and members must be telephoned for their views on a certain issue, it would not be acceptable for the chairperson to be on the telephone when other members could not hear and a vote may be taken.  I have experience of controversial decisions made on the basis of telephone calls from people who were abroad at the time.</P>
        <P>I accept the RTE board will have to meet in emergency session when some members could be abroad.  I have no problem with telephone or video-conferencing whereby every board member can contribute to a discussion and give their decisions to the meeting.  It must happen, however, in a way where all members can hear what is being said and have the opportunity to contribute.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment covers this.</P>
        <P>My only concern is the drafting of the amendment.  It states, &ldquo;meetings of the Authority or a statutory committee shall be capable of being held by telephone or other suitable electronic means whereby all the members of the Authority or the relevant statutory committee can hear and be heard.&rdquo;  If one member cannot be heard, for example by not having access to a telephone, it would negate those who were contributing through other conferencing means.  There could be an awkward scenario of a board member being in hospital.  This would negate other members using telephone or video-conferencing facilities.  Even if a decision were taken by a large majority of the board, it would not be valid.  When entering the telephone or video-conferencing realm, it is either all or nothing.  Either every member is there as part of the process or else one goes back to the old-fashioned way of people turning up for a meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The thinking behind this amendment is not only to cover such circumstances where decisions must be taken quickly but to facilitate new technologies as they develop, such as halo and telepresence facilities which allow for instantaneous telecommunications links.  I have seen examples of where companies have reduced travel expenses and greenhouse emissions by up to half with increased conferencing.  This legislation will allow these new communications facilities to be used.</P>
        <P>It is important that it can only be done when &ldquo;all the members of the Authority or the relevant statutory committee can hear and be heard.&rdquo;  It cannot just be case of a chairman saying he telephoned someone and cleared it with them.  It must be a proper and instantaneous communications link.  It is a difficult balance to get right.  One wants to ensure proper order <Col N="503"/>and procedures in place but also that the board meets regularly on a physical basis.  One does not want to end up in a situation where meetings end up as teleconferences.</P>
        <P>There is a precedent under the company law review.  For example, section 10(2) the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act 2004 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Council may, if it thinks fit, transact any of its business at a meeting at which its members (or some of its members) participate by telephone, closed circuit television or other means, but only if any member who speaks on a matter being considered by the meeting can be heard by the other members.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I take Deputy McManus&rsquo;s point on disclosures although it could be argued it is a board procedure issue.  There is clear direction in the legislation for any conflicts of interest to be recorded in the minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The minutes will, however, not be published.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That depends on how they are dealt with under freedom of information legislation.  There is a requirement that where such a disclosure is made, the person absents themselves from the meeting.  The legislation provides that a member does not just disclose the conflict of interest but also must take action such as removing oneself from a decision-making process where the conflict might apply.  It also recognises that with our small population, it is impossible to pick people in the broadcasting area who may not have a conflict of interest with broadcasting institutions.  Any freelance journalist, for example, could be contributing to a RTE programme for which they would be paid or could be working for an independent radio station.  It is difficult to find people with the relevant experience that might benefit such a board without having a conflict of interest.  It is a subtle balance to decide whether a conflict of interest is so fundamental it precludes the board member from discussing an issue or whether the issue itself is merely an everyday matter.  That decision must lie with the board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that it is inevitable in a country of this size there will be conflicts of interest from time to time.  It is a question, however, of accountability.  Will the minutes be subject to freedom of information requests?  From my experience on local authorities, Oireachtas committees and this Chamber, from time to time people declare a conflict of interest in a matter.  Regrettably in the past, particularly in planning issues, people did not declare and we all know the terrible price paid consequently.  It is not an argument that there should never be a conflict of interest.  There will be conflicts of interest and that is why disclosure of such events is so important.  It must be recorded in a way that can be accessed.</P>
        <P>Freedom of information originally was envisaged to be just that, &ldquo;free&rdquo;.   Requests have been made more difficult with Fianna F&aacute;il in Government tightening up on the rights of people to access information.  I am disappointed and perplexed as to why a Minister, who believes in accountability, has such a difficulty with my amendment.  As conflicts do arise, it is important that some record of them are made and are easily accessible.  The Minister is saying that if one can afford to pay for a freedom of information appreciation, one will get the information; if one cannot, one will not get the information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is subject to freedom of information legislation.  The availability of the minutes of board meetings would be considered within that legislation which is better placed to deal with this matter.  Sections 21 and 22 set out in detail the authority&rsquo;s requirements when it comes to conflicts of interests which could influence decisions it will make.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 23: </P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 33, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) provide a regulatory environment that will sustain compliance with applicable employment law,</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>f</i>) protect the interests of children taking into account the vulnerability of children and childhood to undue commercial exploitation,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Amendment No. 23 places an explicit requirement on the broadcasting authority of Ireland and on statutory committees to protect the interests of children, especially in respect to commercialisation.  The amendment is intended to respond to the concerns raised by Deputies on Committee Stage.  I believe it addresses the essence of amendment No. 24 as proposed by Deputy McManus.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 23 also requires that the broadcasting authority of Ireland and its statutory committees ensure that, in setting the regulatory environment for broadcasting, such environment is conducive to and supportive of compliance with employment law.  The amendment arises out of concerns expressed that there have been a number of instances of exploitative treatment of persons employed in the sector.  In essence, the amendment requires the broadcasting authority of Ireland to be mindful of that issue and in setting the regulatory environment that it does not supplant in any way the role of employment law compliance bodies such as NERA.</P>
        <P>Section 26(1), in effect, lists the primary functions of the broadcasting authority of Ireland.  While each of these functions is specified and dealt with in greater detail in other sections, section 26(1) and sections 27 and 28 allow the reader of the Bill to distinguish between the respective primary roles of the broadcasting authority of Ireland, the contracts awards committee and the compliance committee.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 25 rewords section 26(1) with the following intent.  It re-orders the list to broadly reflect the order in which such functions appear in the Bill.  It provides a more comprehensive list of the functions of the broadcasting authority of Ireland, that is, paragraphs (h), (i), (j), (p) and (q), and makes additions to the text of existing paragraphs (c), (h) and (l).  It amends incorrect references in paragraph (h) of the existing text.  Amendment No. 25 does not in its own right require the broadcasting authority of Ireland to perform any additional functions.</P><Col N="505"/>
        <P>Section 27 outlines the primary function of the contracts award committee.  Amendment No. 27 amends section 27 to encompass the role played by the contracts award committee in respect of the award of multiplex licences.  Again, amendment No. 27 does not in its own right require the contracts award committee to perform any additional legislative functions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the inclusion of amendment No. 23.  It goes as far as anybody would expect a Minister to go in terms of the issues I raised about protecting children.  I appreciate that the Minister has taken the points on board.  I will withdraw my amendment in support of his.</P>
        <P>It is telling that we have the functions of the authority set out in an amendment on Report Stage.  It took approximately seven years to produce the Bill.  The forum report on which it is based was produced in 2002, yet it has taken until Report Stage of the Bill in 2009 to draw up the final list of the authority&rsquo;s functions.  I wonder at this whole process.  We are adding on further responsibilities to a body the Minister now confesses is not expected to cost any more than the existing broadcasting commission.  The authority is not going to take on additional staff, yet more and more functions are being added to the list of functions.  I have my doubts about this.</P>
        <P>We are now living in some kind of alternative reality when one considers, for example, that a report has to be made to the Minister in respect of preparedness for analogue switch-off.  It is a bit late in the day.  The switch-off that is occurring in Britain in a few months will have a severe impact on the east coast of Ireland.  We were promised that would be addressed and RTE has made certain commitments, but, as to producing a report, that kind of work should have been done at an earlier stage.  To include that point in a list of functions bears out the original point I made about the need to have some kind of convergence in terms of regulation because much of this area is technical and relates to developments in communications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I apologise for being so late in raising this issue but it only arose recently.  The ability of people to appeal a decision by the authority is of fundamental importance to a contractor or operator.  In this instance, a radio station serving Cavan and Monaghan was opened in 1989 and went on the airwaves at a particular frequency that is very close to a new station, 4FM.  It is so close that significant interference has been caused to the local station by the arrival of 4FM, which means for the first time in 20 years parts of east Cavan, including Virginia and Ballyjamesduff, are no longer able to hear their local station.  That is something that should not happen but it did happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When Northern Sound complained, the response from the BCI was pretty amazing: &ldquo;Both stations will suffer some interference, but this is the price to pay to give the diversity in programming that the BCI strive to offer.&rdquo;  That is not fair and it is not acceptable.  That is not a decent reply for somebody living in Ballyjamesduff who has lost the local station.  As far as I can see, what happened is that nobody thought out the technical problems that would arise by granting a licence.  I am not a technical person so I cannot make a judgment other than that, but it is quite clear that people have lost out.  The local station is concerned about the BCI&rsquo;s decision but there is no method of appeal.  In terms of the authority&rsquo;s functions, how can that issue, first, be prevented in the future and, second, if such a situation arises again, what are the means of appealing to protect the public interest?  It seems to me that sometimes decisions are made at the centre that do not relate to the particular problems people experience on the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of issues arise in regard to the amendments we are considering.  I wish to focus on a matter relating to an addition by the Minister in amendment No. 25 outlining the principal functions of the authority.  I share the concerns that we are adding <Col N="506"/>a whole series of new functions to the authority at the last possible opportunity.  I have some concerns about one of them, which we will discuss again at a later stage on an amendment that we will probably not reach today.  Section 26(i) and (j) relate to asking the authority to determine disputes arising under section 76(2) and section 77(5).  That relates to the &ldquo;must offer&rdquo; and &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; obligations on new networks that will be provided through multiplex systems and others.  We are basically asking the authority to become a dispute resolution body when it comes to what I anticipate will be significant differences of opinion between free-to-air broadcasters and the new networks to which they may be obliged to offer their programming for retransmission.  The whole negotiation process on how broadcasters will be compensated or paid for that could be problematic.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I want to flag this as a problem area for the authority and the Minister.  It adds a new role for the authority at a very late stage, when there is already a great deal of concern among existing free-to-air broadcasters who have entered into five or seven year contracts with sole rights in Ireland to transmit certain programmes.  New networks that will be put in place to broadcast free-to-air programmes in Ireland will face a &ldquo;must offer&rdquo; or &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; requirement and this will create an issue around compensation for moneys already paid for exclusive rights in Ireland for certain programmes.  We are asking that the broadcasting authority determine disputes arising in this area.  The Minister will be aware of what I mean when I say I am concerned about an amendment dealing with this issue that he proposes to put forward later in this legislation.  Clearly, somebody must have the role of determining disputes in this area.  It makes sense that the broadcasting authority should do that.  We are introducing a whole new area at a late stage without having had sufficient discussion on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McManus for accepting that what we are trying to do in amendment No. 23 encapsulates the thinking in her amendment.  Amendment No. 23 is crucial in that it attempts to give the new authority as much power as possible to ensure employment conditions within the industry are maintained.  There is a difficulty in this regard because in many instances we are dealing with quite small companies with limited resources operating in a very competitive market.  They may not be able to match the employment conditions and terms that would apply in much larger, probably public service, broadcasters.  We must be careful to get the balance right.  We do not want to overly restrict companies, but at the same time we want to ensure the right pay, conditions and other employment standards exist for the industry so as to maintain the rights of individuals and overall standards in the industry.</P>
        <P>We need our broadcasting industry to be well supported, funded and paid so we get good investigative journalism and high standards.  It is difficult to legislate for that, but there are bodies close to that and others that apply those standards.  I wanted to give a clear signal in my amendment to the regulatory authority that it would have to take this into account in the issuing of licences and other work.  It must be conscious that we do not just want a competition-driven model that brings wages and other prices down to the bare bone.  We must maintain certain standards and ask the authority to take that into account.  It must also take account of the issue concerning children.</P>
        <P>On the second matter, the reordering of functions is primarily for clarity and is not included to introduce major new functions.  However, given the timeline for us to get this Bill through and the approach we have taken, which was to accept amendments on Committee Stage, various aspects of the Bill, by nature, require reiteration in order to take into account changes that are being made.  That is only right.  It is better to amend and change legislation rather than <Col N="507"/>stick rigidly to a format we might have had on First Stage.  That is the reason we have five Stages in our legislative process.</P>
        <P>The specific concern of Deputy McManus in terms of carbon is a real concern and demonstrates the importance of this legislation.  The loss of a local radio station, for whatever reason, is a major change in people&rsquo;s lives and can be a significant loss.  When people get into a pattern of listening to certain programmes, not being able to hear one of them has a real effect.  The issue in terms of the spectrum allocation is a good example of what Deputy McManus is concerned about, the liaison that exists between ComReg and BCI in this area.  ComReg holds the responsibility in the spectrum area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reluctant to interrupt the Minister.  If this is his final conclusion, it is open-ended as to time.  However, if it is not, he is confined to two minutes.  Does any other Deputy wish to come in on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to hear what the Minister has to say first.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to reply to two points.  There is, as set out in Part 6 of the Bill, a clear mechanism for co-operation between ComReg and BCI in that regard.  They work together and there is a resolution process for both of them and the broadcasting authority of Ireland, BAI, when it is formed, to resolve such issues.</P>
        <P>Deputy Coveney raised the issue of &ldquo;must offer&rdquo;, &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; on free-to-air programming.  That is a broad principle I seek to enshrine so that free-to-air is actually free-to-air.  I want to ensure we enshrine the ability for a variety of platforms to carry what may be publicly funded programming.  I agree this is a direction from the political system that this is free-to-air.  It is free to different platforms.  The &ldquo;must offer&rdquo; obligation encapsulates that.  It does not determine exactly what the contract arrangements are and does not determine who one can deal with, but provides flexibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I must explain the procedure.  The Minister will have another chance to explain.  On their second contribution, Members are confined to two minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficulty in the specific case is there is no means of resolution.  It should not have happened.  This underlines the point that if we do not have joined up regulation, people end up losing out.  This case is an example of the argument for a converged regulator and I would had hoped the Minister would have taken it on board.  However, we have had that argument.</P>
        <P>With regard to what happened, the decision was made without any consultation with the existing local station and without any forewarning from the regulator about the problems that might arise as a result of the launch of the new station.  When the local station people contacted the BCI to alert it, the technical people agreed with their assessment, but stated they would do nothing.  People are now deprived as a consequence.  The solution presented to them &mdash; which does not sound like a solution to me &mdash; was that the local station could install a fill-in transmitter.  This would cost a significant amount and take a considerable amount of time, not to mention the marketing costs to be incurred in making the public aware of the new frequencies.  When the director of the local station spoke to the CEO, he was given the same response.</P>
        <P>This is not a one-off problem.  It is happening in other areas and will happen to a greater extent as more demand on spectrum arises.  What is sought in this case is an independent panel.  We need some kind of arbiter to determine who is in the right and who is in the wrong and who can ensure the system works.  We do not have that currently.  I have sympathy for these people.  I know local stations are very dependent on their local community and survive through <Col N="508"/>the community.  It is a two-way process.  The idea the local station has lost out because the BCI was not aware of what it was doing or its impact is regrettable.  The Minister said there is a way of resolving this.  What exactly does that mean?  There is a way of resolving it which would incur significant expense and delay for the unfortunate local station, but that is an unacceptable resolution to the problem.  In terms of the new authority and the arrangements being made and in the absence of a proper converged approach, what protection have contractors and operators to ensure this does not happen again?  If, by any mishap, it does happen again, what appeals system exists to get the process working correctly?</P>

	<P>I want to comment on the remark made by the Minister that free-to-air should mean free-to-air.  That is okay for the consumer, but it is not necessarily okay for the broadcaster, because free-to-air is not free-to-air.  There is a great deal of expense involved in the provision of product that is broadcast to the consumer on a free-to-air basis.  An issue arises for new networks, which will have a right under this legislation to re-transmit free-to-air programmes through a series of different platforms.  We must consider the effect on broadcasters that are providing the free-to-air service but financing it through advertising or, in the case of RTE, through a combination of commercial revenue and licence fee money.  That is the basis of my concern.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Deputy McManus&rsquo;s point, proposed subparagraph 26(1)(<i>c</i>) states the authority will have to &ldquo;liaise and consult with the Communications Regulator in the preparation of the allocation plan for the frequency range dedicated to sound and television broadcasting&rdquo;.  Mechanisms set out in detail in section 60 compel the communications regulator to vary any term or condition of a broadcasting licence subject to a range of conditions, for example, &ldquo;if it appears to it to be necessary so to do in the interest of good radio frequency management&rdquo;.  The example the Deputy is citing would fall into this category.  Section 60(2)(<i>b</i>) gives the broadcasting authority the right to communicate issues that arise to the communications regulator, thereby resolving problems.  We are legislating specifically for the types of mechanisms about which the Deputy is concerned.</P>
        <P>Deputy Coveney is correct that a public policy decision must be taken.  An individual broadcaster may say it is in its commercial interest to pursue such a policy or plan but it may be in the national or public interest to give direction that a publicly funded broadcast service should be available on as wide a range of networks as possible.  As such, we seek such a must-offer obligation in our legislation.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment arises from matters raised by Deputy McManus on Committee Stage.  The amendment requires the broadcasting authority of Ireland, in preparing its licensing strategy, to consider the particular digital broadcasting needs of community broadcasters, including both community radio broadcasters and community television broadcasters.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 61 and 67 amend the definitions of &ldquo;community radio&rdquo; and &ldquo;community television&rdquo; contained in sections 64 and 72, respectively, to incorporate the principle that community broadcasters provide a social benefit to the communities they serve.  These amendments collectively address the point raised by Deputy McManus in amendment No. 115 and, consequently, I do not propose to accept that amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 68, in the name of Deputy McManus, relates to the information made available by community broadcasters on electronic programme guides regulated in Ireland and whether the community broadcasters need to pay for the provision of such information.  The main platforms in question are the MMDS and cable platforms.  The electronic programme guide framework is set out in section 74.  This is essentially an updating of the electronic programme guide framework set out in the Broadcasting Act 2001.  The framework ensures that the positions of RTE, TV3 and TG4 are prioritised on electronic programme guides made available in the State.</P>
        <P>Deputy McManus&rsquo;s amendments suggest that community television stations should not have to pay for the information that describes the services on the electronic programme guide.  I understand that the service description is not provided by the cable-MMDS operator but by a third party and, therefore, it is not within the control of the cable-MMDS provider to provide the text.  The working position is that all broadcasters must pay the third party that compiles and provides the information found on the electronic programme guide.  Therefore, if a community broadcaster wishes to have information on its content detailed on an electronic programme guide, it should pay the cost required by the third party that compiles the information.  It is, of course, appropriate that the cable-MMDS operators should facilitate minimum identification to community channels carried.</P>
        <P>Section 77(8) provides that the broadcasting authority may require that a community television broadcaster be carried on a digital or analogue network maintained by a network provider, reflecting the reality that capacity constraints may necessarily impose limitations on the network on which a community television broadcaster can be carried.  It is best left to the broadcasting authority of Ireland to make such a decision, having taken into consideration capacity constraints and the remit, locality and target audience of the community television broadcaster.  For this reason, I cannot accept amendment No. 71.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has made some progress, for which I am grateful.  It would have been satisfactory to have had my other amendments relating to community television accepted.  I can understand the point on the cost if there is a third party.  I was not aware of this and it obviously limits possibilities.</P>
        <P>It is important that community television be acknowledged to have a social benefit.  I suspect that, if this Bill is amended in the future, community television will have a bigger part to play.  It is very much in its infancy at present.  At least some progress was made today and I thank the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome amendment No. 26, which acknowledges in a very real way the existence of community television in addition to community radio.

It will now be required to consider the needs of both community television and community radio broadcasters.  This is a forward step.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Having considered the points made by Deputy Coveney on Committee Stage on the funding of the Irish Film Board, I have tabled amendments Nos. 28, 29, 31, 56 and 108, which provide a statutory basis for the Irish film channel to broadcast advertisements subject to certain conditions, including the total daily times for advertising and the maximum period for advertising spots in any three-hour period.</P>
        <P>One of the overriding considerations is that film and cinema works must be broadcast uninterrupted.  The specific advertising conditions will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, following consultation with the broadcasting authority of Ireland.  I have also made provision for advertisements by the Referendum Commission to be facilitated and for the Irish film channel to offer preferential rates for advertisements in the Irish language.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 29 is a minor drafting amendment intended to improve the clarity of the text in section 28.  Amendment No. 31 requires the Minister for Communications, Energy and <Col N="512"/>Natural Resources to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas reports received from the compliance committee in respect of compliance with the Irish broadcasting codes of broadcasts targeted at Irish audiences by broadcasters located in another EU member state.  The amendment addresses concerns inherent in amendment No. 30, as submitted by Deputy Coveney, and as such I do not propose to accept the latter.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 56 provides that the compliance committee of the broadcasting authority of Ireland will monitor and enforce compliance by the Irish film channel with any advertising minutage consents.  These amendments address the spirit of amendment No. 109 and as such I do not propose to accept amendment No. 109.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad we have made progress in this area.  I accept that the Minister has genuinely tried to take on board some of the points I made on what I would have had regarded as a totally unsustainable proposal in terms of cost to create an Irish film channel with no way of raising money to finance itself and therefore would have to be financed by the Exchequer or another form of levy system.</P>
        <P>The concession from the Minister that he accepts there should be a form of advertising on the channel is welcome.  I agree with him that the advertising should be somewhat restricted.  We should ensure that we can play on such a channel full length films uninterrupted by advertising.  I accept what the Minister is trying to do.  I still have some concerns about the structure of an Irish film channel in the context of the other channels with which it must compete.  However, I recognise that the Irish film industry can be provided with a new outlet here whether it is for documentaries or short films.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the Minister&rsquo;s view of how this channel will develop, will it be for Irish made film only or will a certain quota be set for Irish made film with non-Irish film broadcast on the channel.   If we are to introduce a commercial element, it is necessary to play a blockbuster to get sufficient audiences to make advertising worthwhile and, more importantly, to expose the audiences to Irish film which otherwise they would never watch.  This should not be allowed to become a niche arts channel in which only a very small number of people or those connected with the Irish film industry would watch.  We should attempt strategically to attract large audiences by showing very popular movies and then introducing Irish short film, animation and documentaries between them so we expose as many people as possible to the talents in the Irish film industry.  I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 30 because it is catered for in amendment No. 31 tabled by the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s move.  I strongly supported the idea of having a certain amount of advertising to provide the film channel with some resources.  We must be careful about seeing this in commercial terms and I do not necessarily agree with Deputy Coveney.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on his original thinking.  I do not think he saw this as a movie channel.  I understand it is to provide a showcase for Irish film and I presume Irish film encompasses Irish documentary film making and short films.  I ask the Minister to confirm this.</P>
        <P>Issues are raised not so much about the balance between non-Irish and Irish film, because the Irish Film Board would have a fairly good handle on this, but in terms of copyright.  It is an issue for independent producers and much frustration is experienced where something is made for a television station such as RTE or TV3 and the independent film producer feels that it could be exploited further but the television station holds copyright.  How will this be dealt with?</P><Col N="513"/>
        <P Just="Left">Having a film channel is a very enlightened idea and I am not afraid of it being a niche arty channel because those who would watch it are people too.  I imagine it will be broader than that.  However, I have concerns that sourcing material will be a real difficulty.  We are a small country and film is not mass produced.  It is quite limited.  However, it will be extremely limited if the copyrights issues relating to independent producers get in the way of a documentary or a short film being shown on a film channel the purpose of which is to encourage the numbers involved in this niche to grow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am far more in agreement with Deputy McManus than Deputy Coveney on this issue.  Amendment No. 108 contains the crucial word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I did not use the word &ldquo;should&rdquo; and nor would I because my preference is not to have to rely on advertising.  The change of heart comes not only from Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s eloquence on Committee Stage but also from the realisation that we live in economic times where it may be difficult for the Exchequer to front the entire cost of such a channel.</P>
        <P>My intent is still very much that this channel would have a niche outlook and that in the middle of the day it would show a film of interest to certain schools and at certain times in the evening it would show a Polish or Chinese film that would be of interest to particular communities.  As I see it, the Irish films would be the blockbusters and at prime-time the channel would show a good Irish film, of which there are many, which would develop a large Irish audience.  Irish people like watching Irish content.  The films we have State funded and stored up over many years would bring in huge audiences.  The term &ldquo;niche&rdquo; does not always mean a small audience.  One can have a mix.</P>
        <P>The technology available in studios today to knit this together means it can be done very cheaply.  I commend the Irish Film Board and James Morris in particular for his vision on this project and the way it can be done to a high quality with a very low budget.  Archive and international material is available at a relatively low cost.  The Irish Board Film is satisfied that it can clear copyright issues for most Irish movies in terms of the rights of RTE and others that may exist.  Everything is in place to make this happen.  It is running into an economic storm which will make it more difficult to get it up and running.  I want to include the possibility of advertising as one of the revenue streams if it helps us in any way to speed up the delivery of the channel.</P>
        <P>The intent remains as it was at the outset.  It is to allow for innovative and different television which can use much archive material without huge expense.  Primarily, it will not be an advertising channel.  It is there only as a provision that may assist us to get it off the ground.  It will get off the ground because as an idea its time has come.  The technology is available to us.  I look forward to us getting on with doing it.</P>

I propose that we have a film channel which is a shop window for the talent we have in Ireland for movie making and all of the other broadcasting talent we have here but which would, where possible, be able to pay for itself.  It should try to attract new audiences all the time by playing popular films as well as niche films.  We are getting there and I look forward to seeing how it develops.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 has several purposes.  First, it gives effect to the Government&rsquo;s policy on the establishment of the office for older people within the Department of Health and Children, and it develops the integration of other health service agencies in line with the objectives of the health service reform programme and the Government&rsquo;s policy on agency rationalisation.  Second, it provides for ministerial responsibility for the local government superannuation scheme for the health sector to transfer from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Minister for Health and Children.  It also gives legal effect to amendments made to this scheme by the Minister.  The third element of the Bill is the amendment of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997, as amended, to remove age limits for the travel insurance benefit provided in accordance with that Act.  Fourth, the Bill makes certain technical amendments to the Health Act 2007.  Finally, the Bill amends article 5 of the National Cancer Registry Board (Establishment) Order 1991, which deals with the composition of that board.  This is in fact linked to policy on agency integration in the health service.  I propose to give an overview of the different policy areas of the Bill and then to set out the provisions of the Bill in more detail.</P><Col N="515"/>
        <P>One of the objectives of the health service reform programme was the rationalisation of health sector agencies, as recommended in the 2003 prospectus report on the audit of structure and functions in the health system.  Successive Governments had established a range of health agencies, with over 55 such agencies established by 2003.  These individual agencies each played a valuable role in the development of our health services.  However, the multiplicity of agencies led to an overly complex and fragmented system that was ultimately unsustainable.  Steps were therefore taken to rectify this situation with the integration of a number of agencies within the Health Service Executive and other bodies.</P>
        <P>In light of the efficiency review announced in 2007 and the publication of the OECD review of the Irish public service, the Government agreed a process of rationalisation of State agencies.  There are certain principles underpinning and guiding these policies of rationalisation.  One principle is that the function of assisting Ministers in the formulation of policy is usually best located in Departments and should not be devolved unnecessarily to outside agencies.  A further principle is that streamlining roles and operations should be maximised by eliminating the duplication and the overlap of functions between agencies, and by amalgamating bodies with similar roles.  The Bill develops this programme of streamlining by paving the way for the integration of the National Council on Ageing and Older People and the Women&rsquo;s Health Council with the Department of Health and Children, and for the integration of the National Cancer Screening Service Board, the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The Minister is very conscious that these are agencies which enjoy great respect.  The National Council on Ageing and Older People has made a significant contribution to policy development regarding older people.  The Women&rsquo;s Health Council has played a major role since its establishment.  The National Cancer Screening Service Board has played a pivotal role in the provision of cancer prevention services to women through the BreastCheck and CervicalCheck programmes.  The Drug Treatment Centre Board has made a highly valued contribution to the delivery of treatment services for drug misusers.  The work of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has been crucial in the implementation of strategies to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies.</P>
        <P>We are at a point, however, where we need to bring together these agencies with others to achieve all the benefits that are gained from co-ordination, consolidation and integration.  While there is a clear need to secure efficiencies from the rationalisation programme, the primary aim is to streamline service delivery and policy making in these areas.  Efficiencies will be gained over time from economies of scale and the elimination of duplication in areas such as recruitment procurement, payroll and ICT systems.  While change can be challenging, the Minister believes that the integration of policy formulation and services is the best way forward.</P>
        <P>In the case of the National Council on Ageing and Older People,the Government approved the creation of an office for older people on 23 January 2008 to support me as Minister of State with responsibility for older people within the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. As part of the creation of the office, the Government decided to subsume the existing staff of the national council into the Department of Health and Children.  The staff of the national council have built up a range of expertise and experience on older people&rsquo;s issues that they can bring to the work of the office for older people, and in particular to the development of the national positive ageing strategy.  It is the intention to establish a national advisory council on older people on an administrative basis.</P>
        <P>The Women&rsquo;s Health Council advises the Minister for Health and Children on women&rsquo;s health and on the implementation of recommendations on women&rsquo;s health contained in policy <Col N="516"/>reports commissioned by her.  The integration of the role of the council within the Department of Health and Children was recommended in the 2003 report on the audit of structure and functions in the health system.  This integration was also part of the rationalisation of State agencies announced last October.</P>
        <P>Cancer screening is an intrinsic component of the national cancer control programme and the integration of screening services within the programme is the best way to ensure the full co-ordination of services and resources in the fight against cancer.  The Drug Treatment Centre has been funded directly by the HSE for some time.  The integration of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency within the HSE will facilitate co-ordinated planning in the area of crisis pregnancy as part of the HSE&rsquo;s overall planning for and provision of health and social services, including contraception and sexual health strategies, family support, support for immigrant communities and teen parent support programmes.  The integration of the functions and staff of all the bodies will be carefully managed to ensure a seamless continuation of the important services they provide.</P>
        <P>The Minister does not in any way underestimate the complexities of the health service rationalisation programme.  I said earlier that change is challenging, but it is not impossible.  Considerable effort has been already  invested in preparing for integration and this effort will continue to ensure that the integration process works smoothly.  In the particular case of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the transition process is facilitated by the fact that the staff of the Council have been located in Hawkins House since February 2008, and that a principal officer of the Department is director of the council for the transition period.</P>
        <P>Part 7 of the Bill, which contains section 60, confers the same powers on the Minister for Health and Children as those conferred on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under sections 2 and 4 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980 in respect of a range of health sector organisations.  All powers exercised by the Minister for Health and Children under sections 2 and 4 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980 since 1 February, 2001 are confirmed and they apply to all of the organisations mentioned in section 60.</P>
        <P>The Bill also makes some miscellaneous amendments to other legislation.  The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006<b> </b>provides the legislative basis for setting up an insurance scheme for persons infected with hepatitis C and HIV through the administration within the State of infected blood or blood products.  This provision is intended to assist these people with hepatitis C or HIV to obtain insurance where they would otherwise have difficulty in doing so on the open market.  The upper age limit of 65 for the scheme is contained in the Act.  The Minister agreed last July to remove the age restriction on the travel insurance element of the scheme, on the basis that it discriminates against older age groups who wish to travel.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Act 2007 provided for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, the office of the chief inspector of social services and a new inspection and registration system for designated centres &mdash; that is, residential centres &mdash; for older people, children and people with disabilities.  Amendments to the Act under the current Bill correct minor typographical errors, and also enhance provisions for the making of regulations requiring registered providers of designated centres to make arrangements for dealing with complaints under section 103(3) of the Act.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s rationalisation programme for agencies includes the integration of the National Cancer Registry within the HSE. As a first step in this process, the establishment order for the National Cancer Registry Board is being amended to change its provisions for board composition.  These currently provide for the Minister to appoint a board of up to ten <Col N="517"/>persons nominated by various bodies, an arrangement which has served the health service well.  However, as part of the preparation for integration within the HSE, it is important at this stage to facilitate the forging of closer links between the registry and the national cancer control programme of the HSE.  Therefore, the Bill amends the provisions of the establishment order for the registry to allow the appointment of a seven person board with knowledge or experience of the functions of the board, including those related to Government policy on cancer control.</P>
        <P>I refer to the principal features of the Bill.  Part 1, comprised of sections 1 to 3, inclusive, contains standard provisions dealing with the short title, commencement, definitions and expenses.  The legislation will come into operation by ministerial order and different provisions will be brought into operation at different times.</P>
        <P>I refer to the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  Part 2, comprised of sections 4 to 14, inclusive, provides for the dissolution of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  Section 5 dissolves the council.  Section 6 transfers rights and liabilities of the council to the Minister for Health and Children.  Section 7 transfers land, other property and any moneys, stocks and shares and securities of the council to the Minister.  Section 8 requires the Minister to cause final accounts of the council to be prepared and to submit them to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  Copies of the audited accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 9 requires the Minister to cause a final report of the council&rsquo;s activities to be prepared and to lay copies of the report before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 10 substitutes the name of the Minister for Health and Children for the name of the council in any pending legal proceedings to which the council is a party immediately before the commencement of Part 2.  The proceedings shall not abate by reason of such substitution.  Section 11 provides that every contract or agreement made between the council or any trustee or agent thereof acting on its behalf, or any other person, which is in force immediately before the commencement of Part 2 shall continue in force and shall be construed and have effect as if the Minister were substituted therein for the council and shall be enforceable against the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 12 provides that every person who, immediately before the commencement of Part 2, is an employee of the council shall, on the commencement of Part 2, hold an unestablished position in the Civil Service.  Save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union or staff association concerned, a person transferred shall not, on the commencement of Part 2, be brought to less beneficial conditions of remuneration than the conditions of remuneration to which he or she was subject immediately before the commencement of Part 2.  The previous service of a person transferred shall be reckonable for the purposes of the employment legislation set out in subsection (3) of section 12, subject to any exceptions or exclusions in any legislation.  Any superannuation benefits awarded to, or in respect of, a person transferred and the terms relating to those benefits shall be no less favourable than those applicable to, or in respect of, that person immediately before the commencement of Part 2.  The pension payments and other superannuation liabilities of the Council in respect of its former employees become, on the commencement of Part 2, the liabilities of the Minister for Finance.  A person transferred under section 12 shall undertake such duties as the Minister may, from time to time, direct and shall be subject to and employed in accordance with the Civil Service Regulation Acts 1956 to 2005.</P>
        <P>Section 13 transfers each record held by the council immediately before the commencement of Part 2 to the Minister.  Section 14 revokes the establishment order for the National Council on Ageing and Older People.</P>
        <P>Part 3 comprised of sections 15 to 25, inclusive, provides for the dissolution of the Women&rsquo;s Health Council.  The provisions of Part 3 are similar to those in Part 2 in regard to the National Council on Ageing and Older People.</P><Col N="518"/>
        <P Just="Left">Part 4, comprising sections 26 to 36, inclusive, provides for the dissolution of the National Cancer Screening Service Board.  Section 28 transfers rights and liabilities of the board to the Health Service Executive.  Section 29 transfers land, other property and any moneys, stocks and shares and securities of the board to the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Section 30 requires the Health Service Executive to cause final accounts of the board to be prepared and to submit them to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  A copy of the audited accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts shall be submitted to the Minister who shall lay copies of the audited accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 31 requires the Health Service Executive to cause a final report to the Minister of the board&rsquo;s activities to be prepared.  The Minister shall lay copies of the final report before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 32 substitutes the name of the Health Service Executive for the name of the board in any pending legal proceedings to which the board is a party immediately before the commencement of Part 4.  The proceedings shall not abate by reason of each substitution.</P>
        <P>Section 33 provides that every contract or agreement made between the board or any trustee or agent thereof acting on its behalf, or any other person, which is in force immediately before the commencement of Part 4 shall continue in force and shall be construed and have effect as if the Health Service Executive were substituted therein for the board and shall be enforceable against the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 34 provides that every person who, immediately before the commencement of Part 4, is an employee of the board shall, on the commencement of Part 4, be transferred to and become an employee of the Health Service Executive.  Save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union or staff association concerned, a person transferred shall not, on the commencement of Part 4, be brought to less beneficial conditions of service, including conditions related to tenure, or of remuneration to which he or she was subject immediately before the commencement of Part 4.  The previous service of a person transferred shall be reckonable for the purposes of the employment legislation set out in subsection (3) of section 34, subject to any exceptions or exclusions in that legislation.  Any superannuation benefits awarded to or in respect of a person transferred and the terms relating to those benefits shall be no less favourable than those applicable to or in respect of that person immediately before the commencement of Part 4.  The pension payments and other superannuation liabilities of the board in respect of its former employees become, on the commencement of Part 4, the liabilities of the Health Service Executive.  A person transferred under section 34 shall be subject to and employed in accordance with the Health Acts 1947 to 2008.</P>
        <P>Section 35 transfers each record held by the board immediately before the commencement of Part 4 to the Health Service Executive.  Section 36 revokes the National Cancer Screening Service Board (Establishment) Order 2006.</P>
        <P>Part 5, comprised of sections 27 to 47, inclusive, provides for the dissolution of the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the provisions are similar to those in Part 4 for the dissolution of the Cancer Screening Service Board.</P>
        <P>Part 6, comprised of sections 48 to 59, inclusive, provides for the dissolution of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. The provisions are similar to those in Parts 4 and 5.  In addition, there is provision under section 50 for the transfer of functions from the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to the HSE in view of legal advice that the executive does not currently have the statutory authority to carry out these functions.</P><Col N="519"/>
        <P>The functions transferred under the Bill are: preparation of a strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in consultation with specified Departments and other appropriate persons; to work with appropriate agencies to promote and co-ordinate the attainment of the objectives contained in the strategy; to produce periodic reports on progress and to propose remedial action where required; to further the attainment of the objectives of the strategy by promoting public awareness, developing, promoting and disseminating information and informational material and by fostering the provision of education and training; to draw up codes of best practice for consideration by agencies and individuals involved in providing services to women with crisis pregnancies; to furnish advice to the Minister for Health and Children and to other Ministers on issues relating to crisis pregnancy; and to perform any other function in respect of crisis pregnancy that the Minister may assign.</P>
        <P>I refer to superannuation.  Part 7 comprises section 60 of the Bill and confers the same powers on the Minister for Health and Children, from 1 February 2001, as were conferred on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under sections 2 and 4 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980 in respect of the organisations set out in that section.</P>
        <P>I refer to miscellaneous amendments including those relating to hepatitis C.  Part 8, comprised of sections 61 to 63, inclusive, provides for miscellaneous amendments to other legislation.  Section 61 provides for the amendment of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 to remove the age limits in respect of the travel element of the insurance scheme established for persons infected with hepatitis C or HIV through the administration within the State of infected blood or blood products.</P>
        <P>Section 62 makes technical drafting amendments to the Health Act 2007, including that regulations for arrangements by registered providers of designated centres under that Act may encompass arrangements for dealing with complaints made on or on behalf of persons who are no longer receiving a service at the centre.</P>
        <P>Section 63 amends article 5 of the National Cancer Registry Board (Establishment) Order 1991 to provide for the appointment by the Minister of a seven person board with knowledge or experience or relating to particular functions and other relevant competencies to assist the board in the performance of its functions.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, I acknowledge the contribution to the health service made by the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Women&rsquo;s Health Council, the National Cancer Screening Service, the Drug Treatment Centre and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency throughout the years.</P>
        <P>The Minister acknowledges the commitment of these agencies over the years.  They have performed a significant public service for which we thank them.  The policy areas and services will not be diminished by the integration of these bodies with the Department of Health and Children or the HSE but will, on the contrary, continue in their new environments.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In many respects, the Bill seeks to rationalise some health agencies.  We do not have a problem with this, but I will discuss quangos later.</P>
        <P>I will ask a few questions and raise a couple of concerns about the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  In terms of the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, NWCI, some 300 jobs will move to the public service.  Will this rationalisation save any money or reduce the amount of administration or rent on buildings?  There will be no loss of employment, not that anyone would want to see someone out of a job in this climate.  We must ask why the Bill is being introduced <Col N="520"/>and whether we are using the opportunity to achieve real rationalisation and savings for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>The legislation will enable the Government to subsume five State agencies, including the NWCI and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, into the Department of Health and Children or the HSE.  I do not have an issue with the technicalities addressed by the Minister of State that ensure that people&rsquo;s rights do not suffer.  However, the NWCI and the National Council on Ageing and Older People should not be subsumed in such a fashion as to neutralise their overall effect.  For instance, the Bill does not propose a review mechanism to monitor or measure the change of policy direction against outcomes.</P>
        <P>There will be a transfer of employees from non-established positions within the Civil Service, but what does &ldquo;non-established&rdquo; mean in the context of the Bill?  The legislation might not safeguard the knowledge or institutional memory built by the agencies since their inceptions.  The staff have built a high degree of competence and expertise in their fields and should be regarded as assets to the public service.  What commitments have been made to ensure that the Department and the HSE will continue to work in partnership with civil society and other relevant sectors after the bodies enter the system, which were seen to have been outside it previously?</P>
        <P>The NWCI has provided a board representative to the Women&rsquo;s Health Council on ministerial appointment since the latter&rsquo;s inception.  The health council has provided a useful forum for representatives from the NGO sector, statutory bodies, the private sector, the medical profession and academia in tackling women&rsquo;s health holistically.  In turn, the forum has provided independent advice to Departments.  Will the good working relationships fostered by this direct participation be safeguarded?  How can the continued commitment be protected under the terms of the Bill?</P>
        <P>The NWCI and the National Council on Ageing and Older People can directly link with and provide an independent voice, but they are being subsumed.  On the face of it, this rationalisation would save money, but will it have a net effect of quietening &mdash; I will not use the word &ldquo;silencing&rdquo; &mdash; necessary criticism, which can only be made when people are independent as opposed to being State employees?  The Official Secrets Act does not apply to them currently, but will it apply to them when they assume non-established positions within the Civil Service?</P>
        <P>The Women&rsquo;s Health Council has played an important role in the implementation of the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy 2007-16, particularly under objectives 8 and 18.  Under this plan, the Department has undertaken to establish a gender mainstreaming unit.  Will the establishment occur or is the Minister considering whether to use the staff of the Women&rsquo;s Health Council to fulfil the role?  Many people would be interested to know the answer to that and I am interested to hear the answer to the question on the Official Secrets Act.</P>
        <P>The National Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre has been in operation for 40 years and has developed a significant amount of knowledge and expertise.  It is the type of organisation that should fall under the remit of the HSE, but only as long as its tertiary addiction service, the only one in the country, continues.  As the centre is being funded by the HSE and works with it closely, joining the HSE makes perfect sense.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the inclusion of the National Cancer Registry, the proper place for which is in the HSE.  It is a bad reflection on the country that the registry has only been running for a few years.  Only certain parts of the country had one ten years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of hepatitis C, I welcome that the age limit for travel insurance has been moved, as the current provisions are out of date.  It puts me in mind of another group of people seriously affected by an arbitrary age limit, namely, Patient Focus, which comprises the victims of mis<Col N="521"/>treatment by Dr. Neary at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  Unlike younger victims, many who suffered at his hands have been unable to avail of compensation because of their dates of birth.  Ms Justice Maureen Harding Clark has ruled on the matter, but I am sending an apolitical message.  The Chairman and Deputies Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in have been heavily involved in the issue.  There has been cross-party support for the group.  Perhaps the Bill is a missed opportunity for the Oireachtas to correct what we all agree is an unjust anomaly.  On later Stages, will the Minister use the Bill to address this?  I will not say any more, as all sides of the House are in agreement.</P>
        <P>I will revert to the comments that I made at the outset.  There has been much discussion of rationalisation and removing quangos.  Yesterday, during the same week in which the Bill is before the House, the Minister issued a press release on the formation of another quango, an expert group on resource allocation in the health sector.  The group comprises many excellent people, but what is going on?  The Minister seems to be setting another group as a buffer between herself and her responsibilities.  The clear implication of the press release is that the Minister, after four odd years &mdash; some would say that they have been very odd &mdash; in her portfolio, has finally admitted that she does not know how to allocate resources and wants to get an expert group to help her.  She will move her responsibility to the group, which will report to her.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It would be laughable, were it not so serious, and goes a long way towards explaining the reason, after countless billions of taxpayers&rsquo; money has gone into the health service, that we have been left with an unholy and real mess.  It is real for the 12 people with brain tumours who await lifesaving brain surgery and who are on a waiting list to get into Beaumont Hospital&rsquo;s neurosurgical unit.  One 34-year old woman with two children from west Dublin was diagnosed on 18 January and it now is April.  Although she could walk when diagnosed, she now is confined to her house and awaits a telephone call and our modern health service of 2009 is unable to look after her.  Her husband is unable to understand how the health service can do this or how the Government can preside over a health service in which this is the position.  She is not alone, as I have been informed that 11 other people await lifesaving brain surgery in Beaumont.</P>
        <P>Another man who sent an e-mail to me has gone blind while waiting for an outpatient&rsquo;s appointment because of his diabetes.  He was diagnosed with diabetes and was told he needed to visit an eye clinic.  While he made an appointment, it was subsequently postponed.  He then went to England to work for a while and awoke one morning blind in his left eye.  Had he not been able to attend the Moorefields Eye Hospital to receive urgent treatment, he would have lost the sight of that eye permanently.  Although he has managed to regain some sight in his left eye, he is permanently visually impaired in that eye as a consequence.  He was told in no uncertain terms that had he received treatment before this happened, it would not have happened and he would have full sight.</P>
        <P>The frustration that led him to send that e-mail to me arose because he is aware there are hundreds of others like him.  The Minister of State will be aware of the debates that have taken place in this House on diabetic retinopathy, the need for screening and that &euro;750,000 which was set aside in 2007 and 2008 was left unspent.  It is now at last being spent in the west.  What about the rest of the country and the other diabetics?  There are 140,000 such people and there is a 10% incidence of this eye problem.  Consequently, 14,000 to 16,000 people may go blind.  The cost of 100 people going blind equals the cost of a countrywide service that would prevent thousands from going blind.</P>
        <P>One is found out in a time of tight budgets.  That is when priority decisions are made.  It is when decisions are made on whether people in the HSE get bonuses or those needing them <Col N="522"/>receive eye-saving services.  It is when one makes a decision to spend money on hotels and meetings or on people, in order that they may have life-saving brain surgery.  These are the hard decisions that must be made.</P>
        <P>This also relates to the issue regarding cystic fibrosis, which will come before the House next week.  Young people in the Republic are dying ten years younger than their cousins in the North of Ireland.  At a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I heard Professor Drumm making the point that there are 600 people with cystic fibrosis in Toronto and the system there is managed with six beds.  He neglected to state or perhaps did not know, although he must know now, that Ireland has the most severe mutation for cystic fibrosis and consequently has the sickest group of people with the condition.  They are not suitable for outpatient home treatment and need inpatient treatment.  This issue will come before the House and there will be an opportunity for all Members to vote on it.  While people can talk the talk, they will be asked to walk the walk.</P>
        <P>I now wish to speak briefly about some of the agencies that are not being rationalised but which should be.  The figures published in 2008 in respect of the National Treatment Purchase Fund show that 20,000 adults and children are on waiting lists, half of whom have been waiting for treatment more than six months.  This does not include the patients waiting for three months before being entered onto the NTPF waiting lists.  When such patients are included, the figures double to 40,000 patients.  As for outpatient waiting lists, the figures do not take into account the thousands of patients waiting for outpatient appointments.  There are estimates of up to 200,000 such patients, some of whom have been waiting for as long as up to seven years for an appointment.</P>
        <P>In 2002, the Government promised an end to waiting lists by 2004 but everyone knows this has not happened.  Moreover, people were informed that the problem associated with accident and emergency services, which was to be considered as a national emergency, would also be solved and a ten-point plan was produced.  However, in recent weeks, there have been figures of 387 and 380 people lying on trolleys nationwide.  As a result, 216,000 bed days were lost last year because of delayed discharges.  This is taking place at a time when the Minister of State, who has responsibility for older people, will have been made aware by Nursing Homes Ireland that between 240 and 250 beds around the greater Dublin area are available for use.  I visited St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital this morning and there were 62 people whose discharges were delayed while they awaited placement in the community.  The figures for Beaumont, St. James&rsquo;s and the Mater are worse.  Unless patients can be moved out of hospital back into the community, such beds will not be made available to those people in accident and emergency units who require admission.  I refer to those who, having been assessed by doctors, need to be in hospital but who cannot be admitted.</P>
        <P>The consequence is that the problem backs up onto the ambulances.  Last month, I learnt of two ambulances which were held up in Beaumont Hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency department for seven hours and five hours, respectively.  They comprised two out of the 13 Dublin Fire Brigade ambulances that are available for the entire city.  In itself, that number is extraordinary, given that 20 years ago, when half a million fewer people lived in the city, it was served by 12 ambulances.  In other words, a single additional ambulance has been provided.</P>
        <P>This raises the issue of the ambulance at Swords, which has been funded by the Dublin Fire Brigade and for which the HSE refuses to pay.  The city manager now threatens to withdraw it.  I have informed the House previously of an incident that occurred during the election, in which one of my patients fell ill outside a church and required urgent transfer to hospital.  We waited for an ambulance for more than an hour and when I inquired as to the reason, I was <Col N="523"/>told that five ambulances were tied up between Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital that day.</P>
        <P>Why do we not have spare trolleys, even stored in a portakabin, to allow patients to be left on such trolleys in the care of the accident and emergency staff, while the ambulance collects a spare trolley and heads back out onto the road to be available to save life and limb?  It does not make sense as such a measure would cost very little.  The real answer to the problem is to provide the community beds.  The State has not built them yet, spare capacity exists within the private sector at present.</P>
        <P>Previously, I have called for the putting in place of premodular units within six months that would contain rehabilitation facilities in order that people could continue the acute phase of treatment.  One then can shorten the bed-stays about which Professor Drumm talks all the time.  One will not achieve a shorter bed-stay by moving people out of hospital when there is nowhere in the community for them to go and when community supports do not exist.  In that instance such patients will be readmitted directly.</P>
        <P>As for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, &euro;100 million has been spent plugging holes in a broken system and this constitutes throwing good money after bad and paying twice or three times as much.  Patients were transferred from Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital to the Mater Private to have orthopaedic procedures performed.  That cost a multiple of what would have been the cost, had Cappagh been given the resources to do it.  Moreover, theatres in Cappagh were being closed down for one day per week.  In other words, the public facilities were closed down so the public patients could not avail of them.  They then were transferred to the NTPF, which cost three time more, while leaving idle the public facilities through nonsensical budgeting systems.  I was astounded when the Minister informed me within the last two weeks that &euro;4 billion is being spent on private health care in Ireland.  When added to the &euro;16 billion allocated to the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, one arrives at the enormous sum of &euro;20 million.  It is all going round in circles in the NTPF.</P>
        <P>In the North of Ireland, the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety rolled up his sleeves and became personally involved.  He formulated a special delivery unit that visited each hospital to ascertain its waiting list problems and then returned every week until such problems were resolved.  Heads rolled and there was accountability and transparency.  People could see where there were problems and if those who were part of the problem were not prepared to get it fixed, they got the gate.  Some people lost their jobs but that is what accountability is about.  Accountability is difficult without transparency but that is what this unit did.  The health service in Northern Ireland spent &euro;36 million over 18 months and brought a 57,000-person waiting list down to zero.  It costs very little money to keep it right.  What are we doing?  Multiplying by three their population of 1.7 million gives 5.2 million but we have only 4.2 million.  Multiplying &euro;36 million by three comes to just over &euro;100 million, which we spend every year.  They spent it once and fixed the problem.  Why can we not do the same?  It is because we are not addressing the problem and looking for solutions.  We got lazy during the Celtic tiger period, throwing lots of money at problems.  The NTPF is one quango I would get rid of because it is wasting public money and is not addressing the problem.</P>
        <P>It is frustrating for those working in the public service to find they cannot carry out an operation in a hospital but can do so at the weekend and get paid for it.  They do not understand it.  Eminent surgeons such as Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Keeffe have verified this.  He is a man who does not mince his words and I ask the Minister of State why that doctor can do as many procedures on a Saturday as he can for the rest of the week in a public hospital.  He gives reasons such as lack of organisation, people not being where they should be on time and various staff out sick or missing.  There is no secondary line to replace a person who is ill.  How many operations <Col N="524"/>have been cancelled because the surgeon was present, the theatre staff were present but there was no bed in the intensive care unit?  Perhaps there was a bed but no intensive care unit nurse available.  These are management issues, not issues of medical personnel.  Management should put in place a fallback position to fill the gap when a person is sick in order that the entire system does not creak to a halt.  The system sometimes suits hospital management because of the crazy budgeting arrangements.</P>
        <P>I have not said the following in the House before.  If it costs &euro;1,000 a week to keep a patient in a public bed and it costs &euro;1,000 a day to have him or her languish in a hospital bed when the acute phase of treatment is over, it makes good sense to move that patient to the community.  However, because there are two separate budgets, the primary and continuing care team does not allow the hospital to touch its money and the hospital team cannot access the money.  The patient is locked in that system.  There is a more sinister perversity in the system.  From the hospital&rsquo;s perspective, if the patient is moved out, the next patient in the bed could cost &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 a night if acutely ill.  This is costing the hospital money.</P>
        <P>For the first time, the Minister&rsquo;s press release referred to money following the patient, something about which I have been talking for 18 months.  This is clearly the way to go forward, making the patient king or queen, where every patient that crosses the threshold is seen as a resource, not as someone to be left languishing on a trolley in accident and emergency units.  If hospitals had a maintenance sum and any further budget was predicated on a per patient or per procedure basis, the efficient hospitals would be rewarded and would do more procedures.  This is unlike the current situation where the hospital gets a budget whether it is efficient or grossly inefficient, and that is it for the year.  As we have seen in Navan, operations can cease in October, which is a crazy set-up.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission is currently sitting on a report on a psychiatric institution in Clonmel.  Stories in the newpaper refer to unreported fractures picked up on screening that are healing.  There is a major issue of abuse of patients.  In 2004 an investigation was conducted at St. Michael&rsquo;s Unit in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital on the serious concerns at the high level and frequency of fractures.  Although the report has never been published, media reports reveal that between July 2002 and January 2004, 19 residents at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital suffered fractures, 18 of which were unwitnessed by staff.  There is serious concern that fractures were the result of non-accidental injuries.</P>
        <P>The Inspector of Mental Health Services identified problems with the service at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in the annual inspection reports of 2005 and 2006.  These concerns were outlined repeatedly to the local health manager and senior management team, but nothing changed.  The fracture report and the concerns raised in the annual inspection report led to the decision of the Mental Health Commission to establish an inquiry, only the second occasion on which the Mental Health Commission has used its power to set up an inquiry under section 55 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  According to an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, the Mental Health Commission was made aware in 2008 of the appalling conditions at the hospital.  Rather than ensure that immediate action was taken to protect these patients and to promote their welfare, all of them continued to follow procedures.  Nothing was done and patients were left in terrible conditions.  The article confirms that none of the 145 findings and 11 recommendations has been implemented.  The HSE has had the draft report since June 2008.  Where is it?  We still await it.  What action was taken on it?</P>
        <P>This is a recurring theme.  One thinks of the poor people in Drogheda, Louth and Cavan walking around with tumours growing in their lungs.  People knew there was a problem in September 2007 and did nothing until May 2008.  The same ethos applied in Portlaoise, where the files of 97 women were left thrown in a corner.  Any number of these women could have <Col N="525"/>had breast cancer but nobody would do anything until a cohort of a round figure of 100 was reached.  I do not know what a cohort is.  The attitude is that information is available but we do not act on it.  We await some official report before addressing the problem immediately to ensure patients are kept safe.  This refers to the most vulnerable people in our society, who cannot speak for themselves.  When made aware of it, people do nothing but sit on the report.  When will the report be available?</P>
        <P>I allude to another aspect of the NTPF, the co-located hospitals.  Three or four years ago the Minister for Health and Children assured us this was the quickest way to bring public beds into our public health service to ensure sufficient bed capacity.  Since then, 500 beds were taken out of the system last year, there are plans to take out 600 more this year and there is not a single co-located bed available, nor a sign of one.  Not a sod has been turned on any site and, if one were living in dreamland, one might believe it would be a couple of years if they started building tomorrow.  They will not start tomorrow, next month or next year because everyone knows this concept is dead.  There is neither financial backing nor an operator who can get a bank to stump up money for this because there is no guarantee of a return, unless, of course, the hospital is guaranteed a return from the NTPF, which will send public patients, paid for by the taxpayer, to be treated privately.</P>
        <P>The Minister should get off the fence, admit co-location is going nowhere and come back to the House with a realistic plan to address the health requirements of our people.  The budget will include cutbacks next week but they should address waste.  They should not hit capital projects.</P>
        <P>The Minister has acknowledged that building costs have dropped by between 20% and<?oasys _jy ?>25%.  Why, therefore, was there a need to cut the capital budget as there was already an inherent 25% saving?  Why cause all the upset to those poor girls with cystic fibrosis and their parents who were outside the House today?  Why ask the very brave Orla Tinsley to put herself through all this media hype when she is not well?  She thought the deal was done and the matter was closed.  Last year, having received a person of the year award for her work for cystic fibrosis, she believed the unit in St. Vincent&rsquo;s was going ahead.  Why are we putting these people through such an ordeal?</P>
        <P>Why not look to more clever ways of financing, deferred payment models or the very competitive market where builders, just to be sure of work, will jump through hoops and accept all sorts of conditions and terms they would not have even considered two years ago?  In that respect, I cannot see where this Bill is saving money, although I can see rationalisation in some respects.  Are any jobs to be shed or efficiencies being achieved in administration, building or rent?  I want assurances on the very valuable work of some of these groups &mdash; in particular the Women&rsquo;s Health Council, the Rape Crisis Centre and the National Council on Ageing and Older People &mdash; and a guarantee they will not lose their voice and independence when they are subsumed into the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Government must ensure the Mental Health Commission report is published and action is taken.  Even if it is not published, no delay should be allowed in the protection of patients if an issue exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her presentation on the Bill and the Department officials for the briefing we were given earlier in the week.  We do not have any major issues with the substance of this legislation, but I have a number of questions and concerns regarding its results and the work carried out by the various agencies which are to be subsumed into the Department of Health and Children and HSE.</P><Col N="526"/>
        <P>In particular, I ask the Minister of State to preserve the functions carried out by the agencies and ensure such functions are continued while not being in any way reduced from what they were under the specific agencies.  I do not see anything specific in the legislation that would safeguard the work being done.  Despite the fact that the employees are being transferred under the designation &ldquo;unestablished positions&rdquo; within the Civil Service, I do believe that gives any great assurance.  Although the same individuals will be staying in their posts, it will be at the whim of the Minister and the HSE as to whether they will continue to work as they have done.  Those individuals will not stay forever.  We must safeguard this work into the future.</P>
        <P>The Women&rsquo;s Health Council referred to by Deputy Reilly has spoken of safeguarding the knowledge or institutional memory built up by these organisations.  That is a good way of putting it.  They have obviously developed a high level of competency, expertise and interest in those areas.  It is important this is not diluted in the new context.  They would also have worked with civil society and with various organisations under the different headings, such as crisis pregnancy, older people, women&rsquo;s health, drugs issues etc.  They have worked with different agencies and organisations and in some cases these bodies have even funded those agencies and organisations.  It is very important that this voice and connectivity is retained.  These are general concerns regarding the functions carried out by the various organisations and bodies that are being abolished and brought under the umbrella of the Department and HSE.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not have a problem with the principle of eliminating the significant number of organisations we have, not just under health but throughout our Departments and public bodies.  If we can save money and bring about a co-ordination of effort while eliminating duplication, people on all sides of this House would be very happy to see such a process.  A number of Bills like this were announced under various Departments but not many are being progressed.  I do not know if the Minister of State will respond in general to this.  We do not have a major difficulty with the substance of the legislation.</P>
        <P>Will there be a review or monitoring mechanism to ensure the work carried out by these agencies will continue?  Will the issue be considered from time to time?  Will the Bill save money?  Even the briefings gave no great clarity on whether money is likely to be saved.  I note the Minister of State indicated in her speech that, while there is a clear need to secure efficiencies from the rationalisation programme, the primary aim is to streamline service delivery and policy making in these areas, while efficiencies will be gained over time from economies of scale and the elimination of duplication in areas such as recruitment, procurement, payroll and ICT systems.  There is no indication of where savings might be made.</P>
        <P>We already have a significant number of people working within the Department of Health and Children and the number working there decreased by only a very small number when the HSE was set up.  There are proposals for rationalisation within the HSE, in particular, and we strongly endorse such proposals, particularly in the middle management and other management grades.  That was announced as an intention, but I do not know if it is to be progressed this year.  There has been no information on that as yet.</P>
        <P>In the current context, I am concerned about a slash-and-grab or panic approach within the HSE because of the amount of money it must save this year.  It must save approximately &euro;1 billion if one considers the various stages at which it has been told to save money, including the end of last year, early this year and the most recent amount of &euro;72 million.  It reported to the Minister this week on that issue but the Minister has not responded.  There is a kind of desperate attempt by the executive to save money where it can, and unfortunately much of that will hurt patients and frontline services.</P><Col N="527"/>
        <P>We already have evidence of the purloining of funds that were allocated for areas such as mental health, palliative care, disability and Traveller health.  Money specifically set aside for development programmes in these areas was used to plug the HSE funding hole.  I am concerned that the money for such important activities will get thrown into some vast effort to plug the hole in HSE finances.  My questions about preserving functions and monitoring are asked in the context of the experiences we already have had, where money for certain areas has been used for other purposes in the HSE in particular.  Will the Minister of State provide reassurance on that?</P>
        <P>I wish to focus particularly on the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which had very specific functions when it was set up.  It has fulfilled those functions very well.  It was set up as a direct response to a recommendation made by the all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and was to have a very singular focus on crisis pregnancy.  It was given specific responsibility to develop a strategy to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and to ensure that women faced with a crisis pregnancy are offered real and positive alternatives to abortion.</P>
        <P>Official figures indicate that since the agency&rsquo;s establishment, the number of abortions carried out on Irish women has decreased by approximately 2,000.  In anybody&rsquo;s language, this must be a success.  I first became involved in politics in the early 1980s, when abortion was a major issue.  We were all battered around the head for opposing the abortion referendum in the early 1980s and from time to time it has come up on the agenda again. The attacks on people who were trying to make reasonable arguments regarding family planning, etc., should never have been made.  Regardless of one&rsquo;s point of view, however, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency clearly has been a success in the context of reducing the number of abortions in Ireland.  As a result of its work, parenting is by far the most common outcome following a crisis pregnancy, adoption has decreased significantly &mdash; this is just a fact of life in this country and it is a matter we must address in the context of crisis pregnancy &mdash; and approximately 15% of women experiencing a crisis pregnancy choose to have an abortion.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P>The mandate of the agency was to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies, to reduce the number of women choosing abortion as an outcome of crisis pregnancy and to safeguard women&rsquo;s physical and mental health following termination of pregnancy.  In statistical terms, there has been a decrease of 30% in the number of women who travel from Ireland to the UK to have abortions, a 20% decrease in the number and rate of births to teenagers and a 43% decrease in the number of teenagers travelling to the UK for abortions.  In addition, the number of crisis pregnancy counselling services nationwide has more than doubled and free services are now provided at 50 locations.</P>
        <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has succeeded in bringing to the table services with opposing ideological viewpoints, keeping them there and encouraging them to work collaboratively on developing standards, resources and advertising.  In that context, I am concerned that the work of the agency should continue.  The agency had an extremely precise brief and it promoted public awareness and brought together those of opposing points of view in its efforts to reduce the number of abortions carried out on Irish women.</P>
        <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has stated that in sustaining and progressing the advances made to date, people must focus on a number of critical issues.  These include: better access to and information on contraception and contraceptive devices, particularly for identified groups at risk of crisis pregnancy; improved standards and quality in respect of contraceptive services; measurable improvements in consistent contraceptive use; measurable improvements in knowledge among adolescents regarding relationships and sexuality; improved access to and delivery of crisis pregnancy counselling services and post-abortion medical and counselling services; recognised standards and regulations in respect of crisis pregnancy services; improved range of <Col N="528"/>supports to making continuation of pregnancy more attractive; strengthened understanding of the contributory factors and solutions to crisis pregnancy, using research to promote evidence-based practice, communications initiatives and resource and policy development; tracking new emerging issues relating to abortion and crisis pregnancy; influence policy makers and key players on prevention of crisis pregnancy; reproductive decision-making and crisis pregnancy outcomes; continued positive engagement with service providers, particularly organisations which provide crisis pregnancy counselling where relationships are sensitive and require effective management; and effective management of the issue of crisis pregnancy in challenging economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>I wish to ensure that the agency&rsquo;s good work in respect of reducing the number of women from Ireland who travel abroad to have abortions will continue.  However, the Bill does not appear to contain any provisions in respect of maintaining the agency&rsquo;s functions, engaging in a review or ensuring that the funding relating to this issue will be ring-fenced and will not be used for other purposes.</P>
        <P>Deputy Reilly referred at length to the concerns of the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, NWCI, regarding the Bill and the fact that the Women&rsquo;s Health Council is to be subsumed into the Department of Health and Children.  I support the points he made in that regard.  The Women&rsquo;s Health Council has played an important role in liaising with and obtaining feedback from women&rsquo;s groups, both directly and through the NWCI.  It will be difficult for the council to fulfil this role when it is mainstreamed.</P>
        <P>Deputy Reilly also referred to the fact that the Department of Health and Children has undertaken to establish a gender mainstreaming unit.  It is important that such a unit should be set up.  I am not concerned with singling out women&rsquo;s health &mdash; no more than I would single out men&rsquo;s health &mdash; I merely wish to ensure issues relating to women&rsquo;s health will be given the priority they require by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People is of particular concern to the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor.  It is important that the work of the council is maintained and that its voice should remain strong within the Department.  I presume the council will come under the remit of the Minister of State when it becomes part of the Department.  A number of concerns arise in respect of the elderly.  Short, medium and long-term demographics indicate that the number of older people in society will increase dramatically.  As a result, the demands placed on our health service will become greater.  It will be important, therefore, to protect the rights and health of older people.</P>
        <P>The recent debacle involving medical cards highlighted this issue.  The medical card for those over 70 has given rise to better health outcomes among older people because when they were given their cards, they felt able to attend their GPs or to access primary health care &mdash; be it provided by home helps, public health nurses or therapists.  A scientific study that was carried out indicated a measurable improvement in the health of these people.  There is a concern that these individuals will not access primary health care to the extent they should and that, as a result, they will be obliged to access the more expensive acute care services.</P>
        <P>Concerns have also arisen in respect of the fair deal legislation, particularly in the context that a resource cap will be put in place and that tight controls will apply in respect of the relevant budgets in the next couple of years.  There is a real fear that people will not be able to access long-term private or public nursing home care as a result of the existence of the resource cap.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a number of carers this morning regarding their concerns.  The carers strategy has not been published.  Reports emerged earlier in the week to the effect that the cuts that have <Col N="529"/>been recommended to the Minister for Health and Children by the HSE may include reducing the number of home help hours available.  I was informed by one carer that access to resource care &mdash; by means of which carers are able to take a break from their caring role &mdash; is becoming more difficult and that carers may be asked to make a financial contribution towards the provision of such care.  I also spoke to carers who do not qualify for the carer&rsquo;s allowance as a result of the means test.  One woman told me she cares for her adult son who has Down&rsquo;s Syndrome and who requires constant care.  She is now a widow and because she saved her money over the years she does not qualify for the allowance.</P>
        <P>These are the kind of stories older people are relating to us.  Such people are concerned that as a result of resources becoming more scarce, the fact they no longer qualify automatically for medical cards and that carer&rsquo;s allowance is means tested and a variety of other reasons, they will come under pressure.  Subsuming the National Council on Ageing and Older People into the Department of Health and Children may be a positive development because it may place the concerns of those to whom I refer at the centre of the decision-making process.  However, people are concerned that this will not prove to be the case and that the Department&rsquo;s focus will lie in other areas.  I wonder if the Minister of State is in a position to provide assurances in that regard.</P>
        <P>The national cancer screening service speaks for itself.  I do not have a concern about that because we knew this was coming and that it is part of the cancer strategy.  I am not concerned about it being mainstreamed, although issues arise such as the fact that BreastCheck has not yet been fully rolled out throughout the country.  It is not yet in my city.  It is in the county but it is not in the city, nor is it in other areas of the west and the south.</P>
        <P>On the other areas of the cancer strategy, we had hoped there would be funding to begin putting in place bowel cancer screening this year.  So far that money has not been allocated, and I urge that it be allocated before the end of the year.  I understand a report is to be made available before it is decided upon but it is vital that be rolled out.  The cervical screening programme is progressing, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>I do not have a difficulty with the issue of the drug treatment centre.  It makes sense that should be part of the mainstream.  The hepatitis C provision in the Bill is welcome.  It is a practical proposal which is welcome.</P>
        <P>I support what Deputy Reilly said about the issues that arise with Dr. Neary&rsquo;s patients.</P>
        <P>A number of general issues arise under this legislation on which we can take the opportunity to comment.  In the overall cuts atmosphere we are in, and I have already expressed my concern that the functions of these particular agencies should be preserved, we must find ways to make the entire system more logical in terms of the way money is spent and save wherever we can do so.</P>
        <P>Before I discuss yesterday&rsquo;s announcement from the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the new group she is setting up I want to highlight ways in which we can save money.  There is one area in particular that has been highlighted in the past few days, and I raised it previously by way of parliamentary question.  It may be a relatively small area but it concerns something that annoys the public, namely, that patients cannot bring back the crutches, walking frame or wheelchair they got from the Health Service Executive when they no longer need them.  They may have only used the crutches for a week to move around but when they bring them back they are told the hospital cannot take them back because if they are given to somebody else they might claim against the hospital if something happens to them, or some infection the patient had might be transferred to somebody else.</P>
        <P>In the past it was possible to return such items, although people were given decrepit wheelchairs then, which is the negative aspect of it, but throughout the country perfectly reusable <Col N="530"/>aids and appliances are not being taken back and reused.  I urge that that practice be re-examined because it does not make sense.  These items can be checked to ensure they work properly and I presume they can be decontaminated in some way to ensure infections are not passed on.  I tabled a question on the matter and the answer I got was to the effect that these were the reasons they were not being reused but I have tabled another question to determine if that might be re-examined.  The general public who deal with the public face of the HSE on issues to do with their loved ones find it illogical that they must hold on to a perfectly good walking frame that they know could be used by somebody else.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>There are other areas where money can be saved.  I support what the Minister said yesterday about the money following the patient.  We have been saying that since 2002 when the Labour Party first put forward its proposals on a universal health insurance system.  We wanted that system of collecting the money from the public through a universal health insurance system.  The Minister said yesterday that her new group was not about gathering resources but allocating resources.  However, it is important that we focus on how we take in the resources as well as on the way we allocate them, and I am disappointed the Minister is not examining in more detail the area of universal health insurance in particular because it is a fair system.  It is a one tier system that eliminates the difference between public and private patients and takes from the public on the basis of their ability to pay.  In other words, if someone is in the higher economic sector they pay their health insurance just as more than 50% of the population are doing at present.  If they are in the lower area they get it free, as do people with medical cards.  If they are in the middle, they pay a certain amount in accordance with their income.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Deputy Reilly said, the expert group on resource allocation in the health sector is a very good group.  I have no objection to the members of the group except that there is no patient representative on it.  That is an important element that is missing.  The members are excellent people but I am not aware of anyone who is representing the interests of patients.  I ask that that important interest group be included in the group.  There are people like Dr. Charles Normand, who has done very good research work, along with his colleagues.  The Minister of State may know him because he is connected to the Adelaide Hospital Society, which has some interest in the Chair&rsquo;s constituency.  It has done excellent work, specifically on the area of universal health insurance.  Dr. Normand&rsquo;s contribution would be very valuable, as will that of the others.</P>
        <P>It is vital that we do not simply dish out a budget to a hospital regardless of the work it is doing, and the HealthStat will help in that.  I again acknowledge some actions within the health area because we have to measure the work being done and give the resources in accordance with that work.</P>
        <P>I am concerned we are constantly being given these top down solutions.  That is present in HealthStat where the specific measurements are all being done from the top.  I frequently talk to people working on the front line of health, as I am sure the Minister of State does, and they constantly tell me of measures that could be taken in their hospital, community unit or whatever to save money and make things easier for the patient but it appears to be difficult for the people on the front line to get their voices heard in the type of proposals being made.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>That is the contrast between what was done in Northern Ireland and what is being done here.  The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland visited the hospitals, examined what they were doing, figured out better ways of doing things in co-ordination with the people working on the ground and came up with solutions that are working.  In Britain, Mr. Robinson did something similar in that they went into hospitals.</P>
        <P>There are hospitals here that already have very good systems.  Kilkenny, which is often given as an example, has very good systems working particularly in co-ordination with the community <Col N="531"/>care services, general practitioners and other people who deliver community care.  I again acknowledge that some progress has been made in that regard because there will now be a realignment of community care and the acute hospital sector.  The silos will be broken down, but they should never have been set up.  That is part of the problem with all of this.  The HSE was set up with all these separate units, a layer of management on the top and with most of the people already working in the various health boards cobbled together in what turned out to be a camel rather than a streamlined horse.  That has turned out to be a system that does not work, and that must be acknowledged.  It is being brought back again to bring community care and hospital care together but if it had been done right in the first place all of that could have been avoided.  We could now have a streamlined, effective system.  We could have got rid of the layers of management and deal with the downturn in the economy within the health services with a system that was geared to do that and respond in a positive way that would be good for patients.  That is not what we got, however.  Instead we have this system but according to the Minister this group will not report for another year when she will begin to figure out how to allocate resources in a way that the money follows the patient and that will encourage more treatment of patients and better use of resources.  Another year will have passed by then and it will be more than five years after the setting up of the HSE.  We have lost all that time and in the meantime the economy has collapsed and we do not have the money to do this in a way that can be effective and efficient.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I endorse everything Deputy Reilly said about the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It is madness to pay doctors to treat their patients on a Saturday after closing their beds and not providing them with theatres to treat the same patients during the week in a public hospital.  If we are to save money, the entire system must be re-examined, particularly in light of the consultants&rsquo; contracts, because they are now obliged to spend more time in the public hospitals.  There is a better way to do this, it is PD ideology and we must change it.</P>
        <P>We should maintain the valuable functions being carried out by these agencies, putting in place timeframes so that we can see if they are being done effectively with the expected outcomes or if they have disappeared under this amorphous way of doing business which often happens in the HSE, where money is assigned for one purpose and used for another.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is multifaceted and introduces many changes, some of which are desirable but more of which are worrying.</P>
        <P>I disagree with the remarks of  Deputies O&rsquo;Sullivan and O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s on the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I find it is a useful mechanism.  Constituents approach me who have been waiting six months for a hip operation, I contact the NTPF and the constituent is given a date for the operation.  I do not subscribe to the general opprobrium being heaped upon the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</P>
        <P>Section 61 of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997, to remove the age limits in respect of the travel element of the insurance scheme established for persons infected with hepatitis C or HIV through the administration within the State of infected blood or blood products.  I welcome that proposal because the legislation discriminated against older people in travelling and related insurance.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with rationalisation or moving agencies into the Department or the HSE.  My difficulty lies with the HSE itself.  Where is the guarantee that if the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is moved within the HSE, the HSE will not decide to take its money for another purpose?  That is how the HSE operates.</P>
        <P>I do not understand why, when we are rationalising one agency, we are establishing another to allocate finances within the health service.  The Minister, the Department and the board of <Col N="532"/>the HSE decide on strategy, yet now another agency will distribute the money.  What is the purpose of that agency, even if the people on it are very good?  There will be four layers, with a superior sounding agency to deal with the distribution of health finances.  Will the Minister of State explain that in her reply?  I tabled a written question in that regard because I do not understand it.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to Ms Olive Braiden, the first director of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  She did wonderful pioneering work at a time when even to talk about pregnancy was frowned upon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not matter what she supports, she has a formidable intellect and a pioneering spirit.  She ensured the Crisis Pregnancy Agency moved along with its difficult remit when it was set up during difficult times.  Ms Catherine Bulbulia is the present director and she is equally formidable in intellect and acumen.  She appeared before the Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children and I was struck by the vast range of research and consultation the agency has done.  Such work needs that level of research because it is about more than accounting or talking to someone.  It is real research that is to be supported.</P>
        <P>The agency has helped cause a decrease in the numbers of women travelling to Britain for abortions and has also included the route to the Netherlands.  There has been a recorded decrease of 30% in the number of women travelling from Ireland to Britain for abortions and a 20% fall in the number of births to teenagers, a significant achievement.  We all love to thump our chests and claim we disagree with abortion, and most political parties do not agree with it, but for many years we turned a blind eye to the number of women travelling to Britain for abortions.  An agency that can tackle those numbers deserves our praise.  There has been a 43% decrease in the number of teenagers travelling from Ireland to Britain for abortions.</P>
        <P>The agency has established many other campaigns and put in place a counselling service, with 14 service providers and free services in 50 locations nationwide, providing a range of choices for potential clients, increasing the number of hours and making a real difference to women of all ages because crisis pregnancies do not just happen to teenagers but to women right into their 40s.</P>
        <P>Those who have spoken to me about the agency&rsquo;s work tell me its help is hugely important to those who find themselves in difficulties, and I applaud the work it has done.  How can we guarantee this fine work will not be shoved under some other subhead of the health budget when the going gets tough for the HSE?  We should guard against that.</P>
      
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I attended a briefing in Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel a year ago at which the Headway initiative was launched.  This was a service for young people who were experiencing mental health problems.  Money was provided for that in a subhead, but it disappeared and no one knows where it went.  I am not saying it was purloined, it simply disappeared as if it had never been granted.  This was because it was an easy target for the number crunchers in the Health Service Executive.  I do not want the Crisis Pregnancy Agency becoming an easy target for those who wish to purloin its subhead moneys.  When it is absorbed into the Health Service Executive, I want its budget and finances to remain at what they were set for this year.</P>
        <P>The agency has recently embarked on a fine consultation process with young people on sexual health from which it will have a report by the end of 2009.  It is endeavouring to show to young people that it is not cool to have early and unprotected sex.  It is, in fact, most unmodern and wrong.  The agency is not claiming it is wrong in a moral sense because it does not, quite rightly, go into that area which is for another arm of civic society.  It is not correct <Col N="533"/>that young people do not know or learn about properly conducted relationships in education classes.  In such classes, they can be alerted to the fact that just because one wants to keep up with one&rsquo;s peers does not mean one has to have easy sex with whatever guy crosses one&rsquo;s path.  It is most unmodern and most uncool to so engage.</P>
        <P>The Women&rsquo;s Health Council, which I established during my short tenure at the Department, has made great advances in bringing many important health matters concerning women to the forefront.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s responses to my questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The legislation marks welcome and bold steps being taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, and her colleagues in streamlining and reforming the health service.  The legislation&rsquo;s proposals have been welcomed by many because there are too many unanswerable agencies in the health services.  I hope these are the first of many steps that will be taken to streamline health services.</P>
        <P>The Bill gives effect to the Government&rsquo;s policy to establish an office for older people in the Department of Health and Children.  I find it hard to fathom the Opposition spokespersons&rsquo; claims these steps are going too far.  For months, they have called for health service reform.  Yet when one step is taken in that direction, they fear it is one step too far.  It is typical of the Opposition at present, given a budget will be introduced next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Blaney was obviously not listening to the Opposition spokespersons&rsquo; contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt when Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan was speaking.  It is typical of the Opposition&rsquo;s moves.  We have seen more of that regarding the budget in recent weeks.  It is probably why Fianna F&aacute;il is so strong when it comes to issues such as this.  Our Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am almost afraid to interrupt but can Deputy Blaney continue without interruption?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallBlaneyIND"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Blaney</NameTxt>
	<P>It shows the strength of character of our Ministers who are not afraid to step up to the mark when it is necessary.</P>
        <P>The agreement on the consultants&rsquo; contracts is welcome news.  The faster it is up and running, the better.  The agreement whereby consultants must have 80% of public patients before they can have 20% of private patients will act as a great incentive to our hospitals.  It will lead to further reductions in waiting lists.  The quicker this is streamlined for outpatient services, the better.  Currently, some waiting times in outpatient services are extreme.  Some of our consultants have little regard for patients when it comes to outpatient appointments.  In many cases, the patient is not even dealing with a consultant but a junior doctor.  I look forward to the time when consultants instead of junior doctors will be dealing with outpatients.  I believe this would reduce waiting times too.</P>
        <P>Many hospital services are renting accommodation which requires serious investigation by the relevant Minister or the Health Service Executive.  In north-east Donegal I am aware of several hospital services renting buildings when some Health Service Executive properties could be used.  Major savings would be made if this area was investigated.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and it is only right for the Government to streamline the agencies in question into the Department of Health and Children, making them more accountable.  The <Col N="534"/>public may be concerned that these services will be removed but that is not the case.  It is more a case of good housekeeping.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to my esteemed Longford-Westmeath constituency colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, as she always tends to dispute comments made by previous speakers.  This does not just happen in this House but also in constituency debates.  She is a lady who seems to me at times to be out of touch with reality.</P>
        <P>Figures for the waiting lists for the National Treatment Purchase Fund were published before Christmas.  While I accept Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke may not have read them, they showed 20,000 adults and children are on waiting lists with half waiting more than six months for treatment.  These figures do not include patients waiting three months before they are entered on to the waiting list.  When they are included, the figures double to 40,000 plus patients.  How can Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke explain these figures?</P>
        <P>We do not take into account the estimated 200,000 patients waiting for outpatient appointments.  Some of those patients are waiting up to seven years for appointments.  That is a reality about which I hear on a daily basis in the constituency I share with Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  She cannot be proud of that.  It shows how much she is out of touch with reality in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath, the one she purports to represent.  She must have got her inspiration from the former Taoiseach who is from that constituency, Mr. Albert Reynolds, who read only the first page of any document.  Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke has shown she does not read through all of the reports that have been presented by the Health Service Executive and others.  Approximately 146 reports, some of which were produced by former health boards, are awaiting action.  I am disappointed that a constituency colleague is so much out of touch with reality in the heartland of this country, the midlands, which has been denuded of health services in recent years.</P>
        <P>Promises were made in the lead-up to the 2002 and 2004 elections.  A total of &euro;57 million was ring-fenced for the completion of phase 2 of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in Mullingar, the only acute hospital between Dublin and Sligo.  However, that was never delivered upon because when Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s friend, Deputy Cowen, now Taoiseach, was Minister for Finance he put a stay on developments in the health service in Longford and Westmeath to the benefit of his own constituency, Laois-Offaly.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke took her eye off the ball in the constituency she was elected to represent.  She will not continue to hoodwink the people in my constituency, nor will Deputy Kelly.  He has also taken his eye off the ball in the constituency.  That is evident from the people of Longford and Westmeath whom I met protesting outside the gates of Leinster House who were with the Cystic Fibrosis Association, Irish Autism Action and the Carers Association.  I wish those two Deputies, who also represent those people, had gone to meet them.  Politics is all about listening to people and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are not doing that at present.  The sooner we give the people an opportunity to change the Government the better.  I was listening to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We have heard fine contributions from Deputies O&rsquo;Reilly and Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  Either of them would make a wonderful Minister for Health and Children.  I have <Col N="535"/>no doubt the country would benefit greatly if either of them were in charge of the health portfolio in this House.  That would greatly benefit the nation as we move forward.</P>
        <P>The integration of 15 health agencies as part of an efficiency drive was announced in budget 2009.  However, when one takes into consideration the fact that no staff reduction will be effected, it makes a mockery of the efficiency element of the so-called drive to create a more efficient health service.  The reality is more likely to be that areas such as those concerning the elderly will lose their focus and the Government will continue its assault on the vulnerable, as they will be without specific representation, leaving them unable to stand up for themselves.  I compliment our elderly citizens, the grey vote, as they are called, on the way they protested outside the House when the budget was announced.  They were rightly angry.  Some back-tracking did take place.  The Government should keep its hands off the elderly and the most vulnerable next week.</P>
        <P>We have seen centralisation followed by decentralisation, in an ever continuing attempt by the Government to bring rationalisation to the health service.  That is evident all over the country.  The end result is that important health areas fall victim to cutbacks, while a top heavy executive continues to blunder its way from initiative to initiative, and report to report.  I referred to the 140 reports that are gathering dust on shelves within the offices of the Health Service Executive.  I note that an expert group has been set up to examine how money is spent in the health system and to come up with innovative ways to reform the system, in order to make money follow the patient, as Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan outlined.  While that is welcome in principle, it will be interesting to see whether the group&rsquo;s report gathers the usual dust that covers the ever mounting pile of reports within the HSE.</P>
        <P>There are many calls for a return of the health board structure in some form as it had the benefit of local accountability.  When I served on a health board people contacted me regularly in advance of the monthly meetings to bring to my attention issues of concern.  Currently, there is nothing to compare to the local political involvement they provided.  We were at the coalface and we knew what was happening.  We had a say and we improved systems for the betterment of patients.  I do not see the benefit from the change to the HSE.  Waiting lists have grown longer and there is more discontent with health services across the board since the HSE was set up.  I have heard Deputies from the Government side complain about and criticise the HSE.  Some of them are like me; they have their ear to the ground and they know exactly what is happening.  That raises the spectre of the disastrous decentralisation initiative which, literally, like an Irish reel saw Departments moving in and out of Dublin with the massive costs involved in such manoeuvres.</P>
        <P>The health service in this country can be best visualised as a vast, clumsy overweight dinosaur, burdened with thousands of people clinging to its back, whom it refuses to shake off no matter how superfluous or draining to its economic well-being.  That is evident all over the country.  When the HSE was established, recommendation R3.3 stated there should be no net increase in staffing levels within the health service.  The reality, which is to the detriment of funding for basic patient care, is that between 2005 and 2008 there was a 14% increase in its administrative staff.  Following the appointment of Professor Drumm and what could not in hindsight be referred to as &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;, vast centralised services were divided into &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; with national directors, an abundance of assistant national directors and local health officers.  Last year that error of judgment was somewhat alleviated by the recognition that there was scope for several thousand managerial and clerical staff to leave the HSE voluntarily.  The executive accepted that its structure was overly-bureaucratic.  There is evidence of that everywhere one turns.  Nobody can deny it.</P><Col N="536"/>
        <P>What has happened in terms of the implementation of such cutbacks?  Precisely nothing.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, is sitting sombrely across from me but she has done nothing to deal with the issue.  According to the HSE&rsquo;s office of human resources and the national employment monitoring unit of the executive, no redundancies have been implemented.  In what can be only compared to the waste of millions of euro on prefabs for schools, the HSE is now prepared to carry dead weight to avoid paying redundancies, which it claims it cannot afford.  Even in the current economic climate, it would make sense to offer some redundancies, as this would save money in the long run.  The HSE has proposed cutting 10,000 staff from its 111,000-strong workforce, with 1,000 jobs expected to be cut this year.  It was hoped that up to 4,000 staff would take voluntary redundancy in the long term.  The HSE has an annual wage bill of &euro;7.5 billion and could make a saving of &euro;67 million a year for every 1,000 redundancies.  This situation is a farce.  When we think of the speed with which the axe falls on essential local and national health services, on provision for the elderly, the young and the disabled, this is a massive indictment of the priorities of the Minister and her Department.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister had gone out to the gates of Leinster House today to listen to the people gathered there.  They started to gather there at 9.30 a.m. because of their serious concern about what is happening with community services throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I have an autism society badge in my lapel.  I support its grievances and those of carers, the cystic fibrosis organisation and others who gathered at the gates.  I went out to speak to them.  I have a humane approach to their problems.  I spoke to them and wished them well with their campaigns.  They need all the support they can get in the current climate.</P>
        <P>Despite the failure to curtail staff numbers in the administrative and managerial areas of the HSE, I was shocked to hear that staff at Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital, in my constituency, were informed yesterday that all contract personnel would be let go on 27 April.  These contract workers are front line staff who are delivering services at the coal face to people in the midland region.  People are dying daily due to health cutbacks.  It is a sobering thought that lives are being lost due to lack of funding for essential services, while the massive cost of the public sector payroll and the huge expansion of managerial grades across the HSE eat into health funding.  As a result we have a badly configured hospital system, underdeveloped primary care and an unfair allocation of services that favours private health patients and penalises the elderly, with certain treatments being refused to older people.</P>
        <P>I learnt of a sad case in my constituency yesterday.  A 78 year old woman was crying on the phone to me.  She has a serious eyesight problem and her doctor has advised her to go for treatment to a hospital in Dublin.  If she does not, she will be completely blind by July of this year.  That poor woman is on a medical card and is pleading for help and assistance towards the cost of transport.  If she is to take a taxi from the constituency to Dublin, it will cost approximately &euro;170 per visit.  She needs to make two visits per month for her eye treatment.  It is a shame that such a poor old woman must delve into the savings she has made for her burial to pay these transport costs.  This is scandalous in this day and age.  The Minister must have no heart if she allows this sort of thing happen to elderly human beings who have given life service to their communities.  It is these people who are being affected by the Minister&rsquo;s behaviour and her failure to provide essential services for the elderly.</P>
        <P>The OECD has recognised that the majority of State agencies were created since the start of the Celtic tiger era &mdash; an era that seems an illusion now &mdash; with approximately 200 non-commercial agencies operating at national level, some 34 of which are in the health sector.  Therein lies the answer to where at least a portion of the wealth of the boom years went.  At the same time, necessary retrenchment brings the great fear that voices will go unheard and <Col N="537"/>the most vulnerable will be left further out in the cold, like the poor old crathur in my constituency who was left in a state of panic yesterday.  She is only one of many in society in that boat.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to raise the ongoing position with regard to phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital, which is a long and ongoing saga of Government neglect.  I hoped Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke would wait and give me the courtesy of listening to me.  She talks out of both sides of her mouth when she is in the constituency.  It is regrettable she is not here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Deputy&rsquo;s comments relate to the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted that Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital has scored so highly in the new HSE monthly performance table published through HealthStat, which sees it placed among the top three hospitals in the country.  It has achieved this position due to the initiative of the staff rather than because of any support from the Minister.  Mullingar Hospital is a valuable facility for the midlands and has proved time and again that it is working to a very high standard &mdash; I compliment the staff on that &mdash; despite the Minister&rsquo;s failure to meet promises to complete phase 2B of the hospital&rsquo;s infrastructural development.  It has also suffered as a result of the removal of the cancer unit, which left seriously ill patients forced to travel long distances to access services which had been more than adequately provided locally.  We had a good service, but it has been removed.</P>
        <P>We have waited for well over a decade, but the essential health infrastructure for the midlands, namely the completion of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital, remains an aspiration.  Lives will be lost if the Government continues to turn its back on its completion.  Anything that is in place in Mullingar was put in place by Fine Gael Ministers.  The late Gerry L&rsquo;Estrange, when he was Minister of State at the Department of Health, ensured that Mullingar had a hospital.  When Deputy Michael Noonan was Minister some 13 years ago, he opened the extension that this Government has failed to equip.</P>
        <P>The hospital is situated in the heart of Ireland and is the only acute hospital on the N4 between Dublin and Sligo.  It is a life-saving centre of the highest standard that can match any other facility in the country.  One obstacle after another has been overcome by the hospital and a very fine facility has emerged, of which we can all be justifiably proud.  This is due to the hard work and dedication of the staff, who must be rewarded by the Government.  The farce of dragging out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to phase 2B must end and the outstanding ring-fenced funding must be provided.  I call on the Minister to stop releasing the money in phases and sub-phases, which delays the development of the hospital.  I call on her to finalise the initial plans, which were approved well over a decade ago, by providing the promised funding.  We want it now.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I must bring the problem of the elderly to the attention of the House.  It is time the situation was streamlined and that we ensured front line staff get what they need.  My secretary received a note this morning from the neighbour of somebody who has spent six weeks in Cavan General Hospital and two weeks in respite care.  This person is now at home, on a ventilator and very ill.  The nurse was to call to visit him yesterday, but has not yet called, according to the neighbour.  There appears to be no back-up service whatsoever.  What is the position on the home care packages we were all promised?  We were promised that if hospital services were wound down, people would be guaranteed home care packages.  What is the position on the individual to whom I refer and how can we ensure he will receive help?</P>
        <P>My office and I, as a public representative, are accused of interfering in these issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In November 2007, which was more than 16 months ago, I became aware that Aer Lingus maintenance contracts at SR Technics were being put out to tender.  It was immediately clear that, were SR Technics not to win back these important contracts from Aer Lingus, it would have major implications for employment at the Dublin plant.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department immediately alerted the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the potential implications of SR Technics not being successful in the tender competition.  My Department has maintained contact with that Department since then.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question on SR Technics, in mid-January 2009 my Department was informed by the Dublin Airport Authority that SR Technics had agreed to return the leases on certain hangars to the authority and had signed a letter of intent to that effect.  It was then clear to the authority that SR Technics&rsquo; planned re-structuring would involve closing the Dublin operation, subject to the resolution of arrangements for the transfer of line maintenance for Aer Lingus.  I was informed of these developments at the time and officials in my Department immediately provided their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with this information.</P>
        <P>In mid-November 2008, the Department had been made aware by the Dublin Airport Authority of confidential contacts between SR Technics and the authority about possible restructuring of SR Technics and, as a consequence, the possible return of hangar leases.  The authority advised that, as it had signed a strict confidentiality agreement with SR Technics, it was there<Col N="539"/>fore precluded from providing the Department with details of the discussions at that stage.  However, it indicated that the employment implications of any restructuring were not clear at that time.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in late December, the Department was advised by the Dublin Airport Authority that these discussions were progressing but were still subject to a strict confidentiality agreement and that any restructuring of SR Technics could have a significant impact on employment in the Dublin operation.</P>
        <P>I understand that, in January, the IDA and SR Technics were in direct talks regarding the provision of funding for a training and up-skilling programme in SR Technics.  The IDA was involved in putting together a package for a submission to the company&rsquo;s headquarters in Zurich.  This is only the latest contact that the IDA has had with the company.  It provided training grants in 2006 for the up-skilling of workers and has had ongoing contact with the company since then.</P>
      
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House </i></P>
<P el="0">While the decision to close the Dublin facility was conveyed to the IDA by SR Technics at a meeting with the T&aacute;naiste on 11 February, the IDA was aware for some months before that date, both from information that my Department passed to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and from its own sources, that the company was engaged in a major review of group operations that would have consequences for the Dublin facility and could result in its closure.  The IDA had intensified its engagement with the company with a view to assisting the Irish subsidiary to achieve the optimal outcome in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>As already indicated to the House, both the Department and the Dublin Airport Authority have at all times been sensitive to the employment implications of SR Technics&rsquo; closure, which was announced by the company on 12 February.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are continuing to work intensively to ensure any viable proposals for aviation-related projects to retain as many jobs as possible in aircraft maintenance are given serious consideration.  The Dublin Airport Authority will also give serious consideration to any commercial proposal put to it as regards access to hangars for aircraft maintenance operations.</P>
</Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  It seems from what he is saying that, in 2007, it was known something was happening although its extent was not clear.  Given that the industry is so important and employs more than 1,130 people, could more not have been done?  Clearly, the Minister informed the Department at the time in question.  However, is it a sufficient defence for the Dublin Airport Authority to state the discussions were secret and that it could not have told the Minister about them, even though it did?  More could have been done by the Government, particularly by the employment creating Ministries, to save these jobs.  What proposals, if any, has the Government to save them?  Six hundred jobs are to go to the wall tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>No more could have been done.  The IDA was in direct contact with the company.  As late as January of this year, local management was talking directly to SR Technics about an additional up-skilling programme for workers to try to ensure the company would have a viable future.  Local management did not seem to be aware at that stage of the overall plans for the parent company.  The IDA, for which I am not here to answer, entered those discussions in good faith.  In light of my having made my first contact in 2007, I just warned that if the Aer Lingus contract were lost, jobs could be at risk.  There was engagement between the IDA and SR Technics subsequent to that.  The IDA was hearing from local man<Col N="540"/>agement that it wanted to restructure, up-skill the workforce and put the company on a viable footing.  The IDA was operating on that basis until January, at which time the news was announced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The key point concerns the reporting to the Department by the Dublin Airport Authority.  This is where the communication did not take place.  The authority is under the aegis of the Department.  It is somewhat like the case in Shannon, in respect of which the Minister was not told the details directly.  In this case, the fact is that there will be a very serious impact on the future of jobs in the aerospace industry.  The jobs are extremely important and the staff are very highly qualified.  No man or woman who will walk the line tomorrow and lose his or her job would ever have believed such an incredible amount of knowledge would be leaving this country.  If it goes, it may never be replaced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Does the Minister believe it satisfactory that he was not told what was taking place by the Dublin Airport Authority?  Is this credible given the critical loss of the plant, as now appears to be the outcome?  Is it acceptable that this fact was not reported to the Minister, notwithstanding all the other issues he raised?  There is no point in being in Government if one does not know the full facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The parent company of SR Technics insisted on confidentiality.  It probably could be said the Dublin Airport Authority breached confidentiality even by indicating talks were taking place.  The decision to close the Dublin facility was conveyed to the IDA by SR Technics at a meeting with the T&aacute;naiste on 11 February.  I received an e-mail directly from the IDA that states it was aware for some months before that date, both from information that my Department passed to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its own sources, that the company was engaged in a major review of group operations that would have consequences for the Dublin facility.  It was in this context that local management asked the IDA for help in putting in place a package that could be given to the parent company.  The loss of jobs will be considerable.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked me what the Government was doing.  It continues in its efforts.  The T&aacute;naiste, through her agencies, has been meeting anybody who has expressed a reasonable interest in saving any or all of the jobs.  There are ongoing talks in this regard.  The relevant State agencies should be allowed to get on with this.  The less heat generated in respect of this matter over the next few days, the better all round.</P>

        <Quest> if he has reviewed the public service obligation to CIE; if he will ensure that the fleets and services of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are protected and maintained and that the current programmes of cutbacks are halted in view of the role that the bus services play for urban and rural commuters and workers; if he has encouraged the State bus companies to come forward with new initiatives to increase passenger volumes; if he has ensured, from discussions with those companies, the early introduction of integrated ticketing, real time information, AVL and other technical transport improvements; if he has investigated the cancellation of certain attractive commuter bus tickets; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13928/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The mandate of CIE and its subsidiary companies to provide reasonable, efficient and economical transport services remains as set out in the Transport Acts 1958 to 1986.  It is a matter for CIE and its subsidiaries to fulfil this mandate from within the financial resources available from fares and Exchequer funds.  This statutory base for the funding of public service obligation services has been reviewed in the light of EC Regulation 1370/2007 and a new contract based regime is to be implemented later this year, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and the proposed public transport regulation Bill.</P>
        <P>The annual Exchequer subvention to CIE in 2009 in respect of its public service obligations is &euro;313 million, an increase of 65% on 2000.  This includes over &euro;120 million for bus services in 2009.  Bus services have also benefited from significant capital funding of &euro;148.7 million over the period from 2006 to 2008.  Despite these high levels of funding and fare increases over the years, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are facing a very difficult financial outlook in 2009 due to declining passenger numbers in an increasing cost environment.  In response, both companies have put in place cost recovery plans involving measures to increase revenues, change pay, allowances and work practices and rationalise services.</P>
        <P>The companies must implement cost recovery plans, as it is not open to the State to compensate for current losses being incurred by CIE given current constraints on the Exchequer, EU state aid rules and, in particular, the &ldquo;market investor&rdquo; principle, that is, governments must act in the same way as a commercial investor and are not permitted to give terms to transport operators that are unduly favourable, for example to write-off part losses.</P>
        <P>As part of the effort by both companies to maintain and increase passenger numbers, the Deloitte report identifies significant scope within Dublin Bus to improve services to customers, increase efficiencies and save money through, for example, redesigning the network, eliminating unnecessary duplication and improving information to the customer.</P>
  
        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House. </i></P>
<P el="0">Both automatic vehicle location, AVL, and integrated ticketing have been identified as important reform measures by the Deloitte report.  The AVL system on the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet is expected to go live this summer.  Plans are also progressing to install real time passenger information, RTPI, road sign displays on a selected number of stops on a trial basis.  The Dublin Bus AVL system will be rolled out on a test basis later this year, with the system being installed across the network in 2010.  Associated with this, the roll out of RTPI by Dublin Council will commence in 2010.</P>
        <P>Integrated ticketing in the greater Dublin area is being introduced on a phased basis, based on smart card technology.  A progressive approach is being adopted to allow customers to <Col N="543"/>familiarise themselves with using the new system and to permit transport operators to undertake the necessary testing associated with the integration of the technologies involved.</P>
        <P>A smart card for Luas services has been available on all Luas services for some time.  Smart cards are also now in use on Dublin Bus services in respect of a number of integrated ticket products such as annual and monthly integrated bus and rail and bus and Luas tickets.  During 2010 smartcards with an electronic purse will be available to almost all public transport users in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>With the exception of the single standard fare, decisions regarding ticketing structure and ticket types are a matter for the companies taking account of operational, commercial and customer factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that, as clearly shown in the Deloitte report, at 29% the public service obligation, in other words the subsidy received by Dublin Bus, is among the lowest in city bus companies in the European Union?  It is bottom of the old 15.  The subsidy of 12% is the lowest of any major regional company.</P>
        <P>Was the Minister informed or did he have discussions on the huge range of cutbacks at Dublin Bus where approximately 1,000 scheduled journeys are being cancelled and services on a range of routes such as the 123, 19, 13, 13A, 11A, 45, 121, 122, 172, Euro buses and Nitelinks are being slashed?  Was the Minister aware of this during recent months or is it something else in his portfolio he did not know about?</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the efficiency of Dublin Bus but he will remember that Deloitte gave Bus &Eacute;ireann a clean bill of health and stated it was very efficient.  Why is Bus &Eacute;ireann losing 150 buses?  Does the Minister accept the recent comments of the distinguished journalist, Fintan O&rsquo;Toole, that what he is doing shows personal contempt by him and the Government for people, particularly those on low incomes, senior citizens and all of those dependent on buses?  It is a fact that we will have cutbacks of at least 10% when passenger numbers have reduced by only 3.5%.  At the worst of times, the Minister is showing utter contempt for people who use buses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct if one considers only the amount of PSO on a current basis which is being paid to Dublin Bus.  It is one of the lower amounts in the OECD.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not take into account the sizeable capital investment made in buses which has not been done in most other European countries.  If we were to compare like with like the situation would not be as black and white as the Deputy stated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deloitte told me it considered the capital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to whether I was informed of the cuts, I informed CIE of the 10% rate increase and of its subvention.  In turn, it informed me of what this would mean and that ultimately the company would end up losing &euro;100 million unless cost and efficiency measures were taken.  Dublin Bus expects losses of &euro;31 million.  As I stated to the Deputy it is not open to me under law or competition rules to further subsidise a company or to put further money into it.  The taxpayers of this country are paying &euro;313 million into public transport.  The Deputy is well aware that we do not have the freedom and flexibility we had previously with regard to the amount of money we can invest.  It must be spent very efficiently and well.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="544"/>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have confidence in the management team at Dublin Bus?  Is he confident it can lead an innovative and dynamic bus company given that we have been waiting for almost 20 years for a range of technical measures such as real time information and integrated bus ticketing?  When does the Minister expect the industrial relations issue to be resolved?</P>
        <P>The Minister has a grave responsibility across a range of issues with regard to bus transport.  In particular, the Minister is the regulator for fares and has approved personally all the increases in basic fares this year.  He has not introduced required legislation.  The Minister will bear much responsibility if bus transport is brought to a halt in coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a neat transfer.  I hope management and staff at Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath are innovative and that they start to implement Deloitte very quickly.  I have spoken to the unions and to management about this and they are very enthusiastic.  The NBRU, SIPTU and other unions told me they had no problems with the network and that it was not their business but the business of management.  They might have changed their minds since then.  If management and the unions are flexible and innovative and implement measures such as AVL, the integrated ticketing system which is coming on stream and real time passenger information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest> the effect recent Government directions will have on the roll-out of Transport 21 transport infrastructure projects; the amount of financial resources he has provided to local government for transport infrastructure projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[14020/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework guiding the Government&rsquo;s investment in national roads and public transport up to 2015.  However, in the light of the changed economic circumstances, it has been necessary to review NDP investment priorities across all Departments.  To facilitate this review and in order to provide the Government with maximum discretion in making decisions on future funding allocations, all Departments in receipt of Exchequer capital funding were asked to ensure that no new contractual commitments, in respect of Exchequer capital investment, were entered into without advance approval from the Department of Finance.  It is important to stress that this temporary arrangement only applies to new contracts.  It will have no impact on existing contractual commitments involving expenditure for my Department of almost &euro;2 billion in 2009.</P>
        <P>The allocation of grants to local authorities for national roads is a matter for the NRA.  My Department issued allocations to local authorities in February for regional and local roads.  These comprised a total capital allocation of &euro;495 million and a current allocation of &euro;126 million.  All existing Estimates provisions are subject to review as part of the preparations for the supplementary budget on 7 April.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not a fact, as a result of this circular letter, that local authority work is coming to a halt up and down the country?  Is it not now the time to put thousands of people to work who have become unemployed due to the building collapse?  They can be put <Col N="545"/>to work improving our local roads, local bypasses, dangerous bridges and visibility at junctions.  The Government can select small and medium-sized enterprises to do this work.  The circular stated that all expenditure must equal total income, which means that the authorities cannot borrow unless they have the money in the first place, and that buying for the construction of purchased assets must be controlled.  This is the key time to have these schemes operating in our local authorities up and down the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not disagree with the Deputy that now is a key time for effecting road works.  Between now and the middle of the summer is usually the best time of the year for this.  The local authorities will know their final allocations and any changes to those allocations following the budget next Tuesday, so they will not have to wait too long.  We are spending almost &euro;2 billion on capital projects.  Under this new system, the Minister for Finance has already sanctioned &euro;143 million &mdash; at my request &mdash; for regional and local roads to ensure that local authorities could start their work for this time of the year.</P>
        <P>There will be no undue delay after 7 April.  I will not waste any time getting the information out to the local authorities about whatever money is in the local and regional roads budget or with the NRA for the national roads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a key area in which there is no activity.  Up and down the country councillors are calling me and my colleagues to tell us that no work is being done on the roads.  Significant works can be done locally and they are labour intensive.  Thousands of people can be put back to work very quickly without much technology.  There are hundreds of thousands of people unemployed and there is no opportunity for them to do the works.</P>
        <P>Local authorities around the country have selected key local improvement schemes that make a significant difference to the local network and the local economy, but the Minister&rsquo;s full stop on local government expenditure on roads is entirely unacceptable.  It does not make sense and it is an absolute disgrace at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The text of the road traffic Bill, which, <i>inter alia, </i>proposes a reduction in the legal blood alcohol content level for drivers and introduces measures for the mandatory testing for alcohol of drivers involved in <Col N="546"/>road traffic collisions, is currently being drafted and is nearing completion.  The Road Traffic Acts already provide that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may test a driver involved in a road traffic collision for alcohol.  The Acts also provide for the testing of drivers in relation to drugs.  If a garda is of the opinion that a driver is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle, he or she may require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person to submit to a blood test or provide a urine sample.</P>
        <P>There is as yet no reliable system of preliminary roadside testing for drugs, but the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in this area.  The draft road traffic Bill includes provisions for &ldquo;field impairment testing&rdquo;, which consists of non-technological methods by which garda&iacute; can make a preliminary assessment about the possible presence of drugs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The fact is that the Government gave a commitment in October 2007 to bring in this legislation.  We have waited until now, but it still has not come in.  There is no reliable method to hold the Government to account here.  They made a promise in 2007 but it has not happened.</P>
        <P>We all support the road safety campaign and the reduction of deaths that has occurred, but is the Minister of State aware that PARC also received this promise from his predecessor?  When his brother was Taoiseach, he gave the same commitment.  The reality is that until a driver knows that he will undergo mandatory testing for alcohol and drugs when involved in an accident, there will be no more significant reduction in road deaths.  It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say that it is being prepared.  It will never happen under his Ministry.</P>

	<P>Road safety is a priority for Government, and the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012, which was launched in October 2007, is a key safety initiative.  The overall objective of the strategy is to bring Ireland in line with best practice countries in road safety terms and to reduce the number of fatalities to no more than 60 fatalities per million or 252 fatalities per annum, the figure stated in the strategy.  The strategy contains 126 actions with target completion dates.  It is being successfully implemented with the involvement of a number of Departments, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and other agencies, and there has been a sustained reduction in the number of people killed on our roads.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Last year yielded the lowest number of fatalities on record and records began in the late 1950s.  The downward trend continues this year, with a further reduction of 19 this year.  The funding of other Departments and their agencies involved in road safety is a matter for those Departments.  In the light of the current difficult economic situation, the final allocation to the Department of Transport and the Road Safety Authority for this year will be published in the Revised Estimates Volume following the Supplementary Budget Statement next Tuesday.  In that context, the 2008 allocation included a special provision to reduce the driver testing backlog.  This objective was achieved and the RSA is maintaining the driver test waiting time at ten weeks.</P>
        <P>The RSA will continue its activities in 2009, making best use of both Exchequer funding and the fee income generated by the agency.  The road safety strategy remains the way forward agreed by the Government, for the RSA and for all other agencies involved, with the objective of continuing to save lives and reduce injuries on our roads.</P>

	<P>As Fine Gael spokesperson on road safety issues, I have always supported the Government in respect of measures on road safety.  I have no doubt that following the last time Oral Questions on transport issues were taken in the House, there will be no cut in any support for road safety in next week&rsquo;s budget, except for the &euro;20 million allocation to reduce the waiting list for driver licences.  However, the figures provided by the Minister of State could have been thrown out the window following events last week in Slane, County Meath.  In recent years, there have been surveys costing &euro;700,000, &euro;500,000 and &euro;200,000 carried out, yet we are still no further down the line.</P><Col N="548"/>
        <P>I put a question to the Minister for Transport who is from my country and who has seen certain events take place in Enfield.  I realise the bridge cannot be built in Slane within the coming four or five years.  However, will he instruct the National Roads Authority to divert all heavy vehicles from Slane?  Meath County Council made such a provision in Enfield several years ago in the interests of road safety.  This evening, I must meet the families of those who were involved in that accident, which could have thrown the whole road safety strategy and road safety results out the window.  I have not played politics on this matter before.  This is a general question, but it is a serious issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very serious issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not play politics, but it seems some people are beginning to play politics regarding promises related to Slane bridge.  Until Slane bridge is built, will the Minister, who has the authority to do so, instruct the NRA to remove heavy vehicles from Slane?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The first question was if I could guarantee if there would not be any cut for the allocation of the Road Safety Authority next Tuesday.  I cannot because it would be altogether wrong of me to try to guess what the Minister for Finance intends to do next week.  We have all heard about different taxation and revenue raising matters and cutbacks in various Departments.  I cannot guess the answer.  We must wait and see how it works out.  I am not an authority on Slane, but I replied to an Adjournment debate matter on the issue.  I indicated that approximately &euro;500,000 would be spent this year by the NRA in the planning of the project.  I do not often travel through Slane.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State would be a good deal safer if he did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister of State is fleeing the country, he may go that route.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise the problem.  Construction will not start this year, but I understand &euro;500,000 will be spent on the planning and design of it.  One accident cannot send all our hopes and dreams out the window.  The figures for January and February were very good this year.  The figures for March were dreadful until St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, but thankfully, since then, there was a period of eight or nine days during which no one was killed on the roads.  It is the case that one believes everything is going well one month, but one accident can blow it out of the water.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 22 people have been killed on that bridge between McGruder&rsquo;s Cross and Slane.  We could have had 22 killed all at once.  Since the Minister has the authority, will he provide the money to the NRA to build a bridge?  I am realistic and I am aware that cannot take place, but I call on the Minister to give the authority to the NRA to stop heavy goods vehicles, except for those with a licence to do business in the area, from entering Slane.  That is the only measure the people of Slane will accept.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect from my days in the local authority such a decision is more relevant to the local authority in question.  In Dublin there are three tonne limits, areas where trucks are forbidden and a HGV cordon around Dublin Port which was introduced by Dublin City Council.  I am subject to correction, but banning trucks from a given area is a matter for the local authority rather than the Department.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="549"/>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the NRA is the only relevant authority which may do so.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest> if he has strategies to make CIE financially more self sufficient; his plans to reduce subvention to CIE; the amount of public money given in both capital and PSO, public service obligation, payments to CIE since 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13792/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>CIE derives the bulk of its revenue from fare income.  The Exchequer subvention to CIE in respect of its public service obligation amounted to 27% of its operating costs in 2007 compared with 22% in 1997.  This growth in the proportion of costs accounted for by the Exchequer subvention reflects increased Government support for the provision of more and better public transport services and the increased costs of such services.  I expect that CIE and its subsidiaries will, in addition to a high level of Exchequer support, have to rely increasingly on increased fare revenue, cost reductions and efficiencies to ensure their financial stability.</P>
        <P>During the period 1997 to 2008, a total of &euro;2.7 billion in Exchequer funding was paid to CIE in respect of compensation for its public service obligations.  In the same period a total of &euro;2.9 billion was paid in capital grants mainly in respect of rail development works.  The bulk of the current subvention for services relates to rail services, with &euro;191 million or 62% of the total subvention allocated to rail in 2008.</P>
        <P>The recently published Deloitte cost and efficiency review reported that the levels of operational subvention of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are lower than in other EU member states.  The annual subvention paid to CIE in respect of its PSO services has grown from &euro;133 million in 1997 to &euro;313 million in 2009, an increase of 135%.  Decisions in respect of the level of funding in the years ahead will be made as part of the budgetary process and, in the case of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, taking account of the implementation of the recommendations of the cost and efficiency review.  The Government will be seeking to maintain investment in the development and operation of public transport services at as high a level as possible to promote public transport use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There have been significant improvements, especially in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the infrastructure.  I welcome such proposals as the underground DART plans and new signalling on the Malahide route inward, which will increase capacity from 12 to 20 trains per hour and make a substantial difference to the throughput.  However, the Minister stated that since 1997 the allocation has increased from &euro;133 million to &euro;330 million.  I realise much of that allocation is capital, but Government proposals to increase competition, especially bus competition, have not come to fruition to date.  Part of the problem enunciated by my colleague Deputy Broughan today is that dozens of Dublin Bus routes are being cut and some 120 buses will be put in mothballs.  This is a result of the policy of the Government not to introduce competition to bus routes, although that was promised ten years ago.  Such a move would help to reduce the taxation subsidy to CIE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that there is logic in the Deputy&rsquo;s argument in respect of the introduction of competition.  There in competition in the bus market.  Anyone can apply <Col N="550"/>for a licence for any route.  There are specific issues and considerations related to the issuing of a licence, but anyone may compete.  Also, with the new directive in place from December of this year, there must be open competition for any new PSO routes.  I do not understand the Deputy&rsquo;s logic of introducing more competition in the Dublin market to save money on the PSO.  PSO routes are those on which a subsidy will be required irrespective of whether there is competition.  The reason for PSOs is that the relevant routes are not commercially viable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister in that PSOs will be necessary for a range of routes.  In his first answer on this issue, he confirmed that the public subsidies for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann were among the smallest in Europe.  The latter&rsquo;s 12% subsidy could be contrasted with, for example, two or three companies in the Netherlands that receive subsidies of 50% or 51%.  TEC in Wallonia receives a 51% subsidy.  Ongoing support for public transport is necessary.  Does the Minister accept that it is a public good?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister regularly approve business plans for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann?  Was he aware of their significant service expansions, that they were taking on more drivers and so on?  Many young drivers who are family men and women have complained to me that the Minister encouraged the companies to employ staff.  The new staff, particularly employees with less than one year&rsquo;s service, were caught when he reversed gear due to the lower passenger numbers, which owes to the recession, the Cowen depression or whatever we want to call it.  Was the Minister not aware of what was occurring in recent years in both companies?  Knowing is one of his statutory duties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past number of years, my predecessors and I have increased the subsidy substantially.  It is not my business to get passengers for Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath or Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That is a matter for the companies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not seen the key point.  Is he aware that when a private bus operates on a PSO route, the taxpayers&rsquo; subsidy is to the PSO and not to the bus itself?  However, both Dublin Bus and the PSO are subsidised on the route.  This is the difference.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>More private buses operating in the Dublin Bus area would reduce the cost to the taxpayer.  They operate in the Bus &Eacute;ireann area.  This is the difference between the two companies.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a relationship with private contractors and Dublin Bus does not.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Last December, I announced the deferral until 2011 of a decision on the separation of the three State airports under the State Airports Act 2004, given the difficulties in the aviation market.  Up to that time, the boards of Cork and Shannon airports were required to finalise business plans for eventual separation for approval by both the Ministers for Transport and Finance.  This necessitated the procurement of advice from consultants at a cost of &euro;334,000 on the financial and operational readiness of the airports for separation.  This advice related to an assessment of the financial and other conditions necessary to facilitate separation, the evaluation of business plans and the resolution of certain issues identified in the business planning process.  Professional advice was necessary to enable me to make an informed decision regarding the separation.</P>
        <P>The two major elements comprised work undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers at a cost of &euro;292,000 on aspects of State airport business planning and additional work, costing &euro;42,000, undertaken by Mr. Peter Cassells that mainly dealt with the treatment of Cork Airport&rsquo;s debt in the context of separation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that the airports incurred other costs.  Could the Minister request the figure, which is the thrust of the question?  I accept that money has been invested, but the Act was passed in 2004 and we will wait until 2011 until it is acted on.  What value for money will we receive as a result of the Government not proceeding with the implementation of the Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will get the information for the Deputy.  I do not have it to hand, but I will request it from the airports.</P>

	<P>That is grand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I agreed to the deferral of the separation following a request from the three airport authorities.  They believed that separating at this time would be serious, an assessment with which I agreed.  Had we gone ahead with it in the current climate, the costs involved would have been more serious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party believes that serious costs would have been involved in any climate.  Is it not time to abandon this crazy plan in the 2004 legislation and to restore Aer Rianta so that a proper national company can run the three airports?  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, being in charge of some aspects of Cork and Shannon airports is ridiculous.  Let us have Aer Rianta back.</P>

        <Quest> the contingency plan in existence in the event of wide-scale strikes in major airports here; the contact he has had with the Dublin Airport Authority and the unions in order to avoid wide-scale disruptive actions at airports; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13759/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports and, as such, the preparation of a contingency plan in the event of a strike is a matter for the DAA.</P>
        <P>In fulfilling its remit, the DAA seeks to ensure that the maintenance of continuity of service across the wide range of services it provides to airlines and passengers.  I understand the DAA has strategies, policies and contingency plans to deal with unforeseen events and managing crisis situations, including those situations where service is disrupted.  A key aim of the DAA is to have systems that reduce the potential for disruption in the first instance and, where the disruption occurs, to manage the safety and security of passengers and airport employees.</P>
        <P>The risk of disruption due to industrial action by any grouping of its core staff can be minimised by a willingness to engage with and use the industrial relations machinery of the State when matters of dispute arise.  In this regard, I am informed the DAA has a registered agreement with the Labour Court that provides for a no strike clause in respect of potential industrial action by the fire and police emergency services during the lifetime of the agreement.  Issues concerning the scope or alteration of the agreement are resolved through the normal third party mechanisms and, if necessary, through binding recommendation of the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that both DAA management and unions are engaged in talks to resolve the outstanding labour relation issues under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and, consequently, the threat of closure of the airports on 2 April has been withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>While I thank the Minister for his response, I suggest the key issue in this regard is a no strike clause for everyone who is involved in critical transport infrastructure, such as airports, and that this is where Government policy should rest.  The aim should be to get a no strike clause to protect the public and the economy in respect of critical infrastructure such as airports.  I stress that I greatly welcome the decision of the unions&rsquo; leadership not to hold that strike.  However, it had a significant impact because it was threatened and, consequently, people cancelled business deals and transport plans.  It is not good enough, in the 21st century, that anyone can threaten such a strike at such a critical period.  Basically, it constitutes economic sabotage and we must opt for no strike clauses for those involved in critical transport infrastructure such as the airports.  I seek the Minister&rsquo;s views in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the Deputy, I welcome that this strike did not go ahead.  However, I also accept his comments to the effect that even the threat of an industrial dispute that might close the airport has a disruptive effect.  It causes both uncertainty and people to change plans and perhaps to make alternative arrangements.  It is not something that I like to observe and I agree with the Deputy in this regard.</P>
        <P>As I noted in my reply, a no strike clause is in operation in respect of fire and police emergency services during the lifetime of the existing agreement with the DAA.  I would welcome <Col N="555"/>its extension across the entire range of essential services.  In this day and age, both management and unions should be able to resolve their difficulties through the normal industrial relations mechanisms of the State.  I encourage them to so do and encourage the trade union movement to engage with management to try to ensure that this happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I wish to comment on the great dignity shown by workers in Dublin Airport across a number of companies.  Recently, for example, Aer Lingus workers negotiated a complete downgrading of their jobs and conditions to help the company to survive and they did so in a most dignified and responsible manner.  The national leadership acted similarly in respect of the Dublin Airport Authority workers and above all, in the past five or six weeks, the SR Technics workers have shown enormous dignity and courage.  They have tried, in a dignified, calm and responsible way, to preserve their jobs and get their basic entitlements.  This is the reality and not the r&aacute;im&eacute;is one hears in this House from Fine Gael or the talk from Ryanair about bringing in the Army.  The only person in Ryanair who gets to negotiate his own salary is the chief executive himself, who has the best of professional advice.</P>
        <P>My understanding is that, as I speak, the management buy-out team at SR Technics is negotiating with IDA Ireland, under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to try to preserve the jobs at the company and to ensure that 600 skilled men and women will not be on the streets and signing on tomorrow morning.  I have to hand a recent e-mail sent to the Labour Party leader from the representatives of the SR Technics workers to the effect that they desperately need time from the SR Technics management team in Zurich, Abu Dhabi and Dubai to allow them to put in place the structures that will retain the vast bulk of those jobs.  Can the Minister offer his support in this regard this evening?</P>
        <P>Earlier today, I asked the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, whether the T&aacute;naiste would contact Sheikh Mohammed Al-Maktoum, who is the Emir of Dubai and the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle may be aware, he owns 100% of SR Technics in Dublin, Zurich, Stansted and the Middle East.  I have asked our leader to talk to the owner of SR Technics to ask him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a final point, I understand that Sheikh Mohammed and the United Arab Emirates consider themselves to be friends of Ireland and that they would be prepared to allow the kind of time that is needed to avoid the scenario in which valiant and highly skilled workers, who are among the most skilled in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>While I will try to remain within Standing Orders in this regard, the Deputy can be assured that anything the Government can do, through the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of SR Technics, will be done.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="556"/>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Friday, a deputation, which I was unable to meet, asked for a postponement of the sale of some tooling equipment and so on.  My Department immediately passed on that request to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the sale subsequently was deferred.  Anything the Government can do and that is within its power certainly will be done to try to ensure that as many jobs as possible are preserved.  That is what is happening in respect of the agencies such as the IDA and so on.  If a viable alternative exists, the Government does not wish to see such highly skilled workers losing their jobs.  We will do everything we can to avoid that situation arising.</P>

        <Quest> the amount of money that has been spent on enabling works for all proposed rail projects; if the Department of Finance has been in contact with him regarding the metro north project; when he expects Government commitment for the metro north project; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13763/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Enabling works on rail projects, such as ground clearance and utility diversions, generally follow the granting of a railway order and are incorporated into the overall cost of projects.  No Exchequer funds are currently being spent on enabling works in respect of rail projects, other than metro north, which have not yet secured an enforceable railway order and are, as a consequence, not yet at construction.  However, planning and design work, which is at various stages of development on such projects, is ongoing. </P>
        <P>The Government approved the funding structure for the metro north PPP last year, including an Exchequer provision for advance works ahead of the main PPP contract and a capital contribution during construction.  Since that Government decision, approximately &euro;8 million has been spent by the RPA in respect of enabling works at the Ballymun Interchange on the M50 and at the Mater Hospital site.  The works at the Mater site are associated with the interface between metro north and the planned new hospital at the Mater.  In the absence of the enabling works at the Mater site, it would not have been possible to provide a station at the location as planned, given that the works being undertaken to deliver the new adult hospital.  The works on the M50 were undertaken as part of the current works to widen the M50 to avoid further disruption at a later date with works on metro north.  The carrying out of other enabling works, such as utility diversions, is dependent on the granting of a railway order by An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>The oral hearing before An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la on the railway order application for metro north commenced yesterday and the board has indicated its anticipated decision on this application to be before 4 September this year.  In these circumstances, it is most unlikely that enabling works will commence in the current year.  However, both the RPA and my Department will keep the matter under review.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to brief the Government after the decision on the railway order is made and prior to the main enabling works commencing.  My Department will also continue to be in regular contact with the Department of Finance on metro north and other Transport 21 projects.  I understand from the RPA that tenders for the metro north PPP were submitted by the four bidding consortia in February this year and these are currently being evaluated by the RPA.  It is anticipated that the tender process will be completed during 2010.  In accordance with <Col N="557"/>the requirements of the Government decision on Transport 21, metro north will be submitted to Government for a final decision at that stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying that metro north will proceed at the end of this process?  The 7,000 construction jobs will be very important, as will the economic benefit to the country, particularly the greater Dublin area, Fingal and beyond.  The cost is the key question.  While everyone supports the project, the cost of the project must be identified as quickly as possible.  We were told we could not know what this would cost because of the secrecy of the ongoing process.  Does it make sense for the Comptroller and Auditor General, or some such body, to verify that the costs are in line and that the project represents good value for money?  We have no doubt that metro north is important for the development of the country, the airport and Fingal but it is important that there is an accountable process, independent of the Government, to verify that costs are fair and proper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of reasons why costs are not disclosed in advance.  One is to ensure that estimated costs do not become the floor rather than the ceiling, as happened in so many projects. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Once we have the railway order, the preferred tenderers will be asked to submit the final tender once they know the route and the works involved.  Once that is submitted a full capital appraisal will be undertaken, independently of my Department, by the Department of Finance.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>That will take place at the final stage and the overall cost will be published.  A number of assessments have been done on the rate of return from metro north and all proved positive.  Either the current Oireachtas joint committee or the previous one carried out an appraisal of the cost-benefit analysis and professed itself satisfied with the good rate of return and recommended that the project go to the next stage.  If it represents good value for money it will go ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to report a note from the wonderful Labour Party staff to the effect that the IDA and an investor have agreed terms for the takeover of SR Technics.  The new owners will need two weeks for due diligence, during which SR Technics will be required to pay staff, which they are refusing to do at present.  I renew my call for the Minister to help to save these jobs, which are on a knife-edge.  This needs diligent action.</P>
        <P>I have had differences with the Minister this morning and yesterday but I commend him on holding the line on this major project, metro north.  It will be a case of &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo;.  It is a great project and in the years after 2015 the costs will run to &euro;150 million per year.  It is within our grasp.</P>
        <P>Regarding the broader transport capital budget, we saw a range of project cancellations last week.  Our media colleagues tell us that the Departments of Transport and Education and Science have the highest level of committed and non-contracted money.  Is that the case?  Of the &euro;3.5 billion, will a significant portion be cut away by the Minister for Finance?</P>

	<P>While it has nothing to do with the question, some &euro;1.44 billion is contractually committed out of a total of approximately &euro;1.9 billion.  Of a further &euro;500-600 million for local authorities, some &euro;126 million has been committed, accounting for another &euro;300 million.  The bulk of the national roads funding is committed, all except the &euro;50 million.  We did not cancel any of the projects listed in the newspaper reports but, in line with the question tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on local roads, the Department was told it would need specific sanction and none would be granted until after the capital and current expenditure would be decided in the budget.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 37 together.  </P>
        <P>It is important that the market offers a diverse range of viable maritime links in and out of the State to facilitate trade and tourism.  Ireland is well served by ferry links to the UK and continental Europe.  These links are frequent and competitive.  The full list of services can be viewed on the website of the Irish Maritime Development Office.  Any new service must be market driven.  It is not Government policy to fund international ferry services.  Ireland has one of the most extensive short sea networks in Europe with multiple operators and various alternate modes of shipping available.  In the past decade, there has been an 80% increase in the number of services between Ireland and the UK and European markets.</P>
        <P>Shipping operates in a highly liberalised global market environment, which has enhanced competition on the key Irish routes.  The ongoing development of our shipping network has provided the Irish market with more competition, choice and frequency in accessing the global market.</P>

	<P>The loss of the Cork to Swansea connection has had a significant and adverse impact on the local economy, particularly in east and west Cork and south Kerry.  Is the Minister of State aware that the local communities have made available a fund of &euro;3 million to help restore this service?  I understand there is a ship in one of the Nordic countries which could be purchased in order to return to the local economy the benefit of the link between Cork and Swansea.  It is very important, particularly for tourism, and tourism interests are particularly concerned at the service&rsquo;s absence.  What steps will the Minister of State now take with that &euro;3 million in order to immediately restore this essential economic service to the area?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="559"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the campaign to try to open the route again.  An examination of the proposals has taken place and it has been said that subject to getting a suitable vessel, with the one mentioned by the Deputy being targeted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The report indicates the service could be viable on an all-year basis and I hope the efforts to get the service running are successful and it can be shown to be commercially viable.  The Port of Cork and the Irish Maritime Development Office have both been in touch with the promoters and are trying to be as helpful as possible.  We do not provide any State subsidy for such a route but I hope the proposals will be successful, the ship can be acquired and the service will get up and running again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly support those comments.  The Welsh Assembly and local interests in Cork estimate that the Cork to Swansea ferry was worth approximately &euro;70 million to the two economies and it is therefore critical that we get it up and running again.</P>
        <P>In general, it seems to some who observe ferry connectivity with Britain that such connectivity is declining rather than increasing.  There are threats to Stena coming out of the port of D&uacute;n Laoghaire into Holyhead and sailings have been seriously cut back to one per day.  Is the Minister of State aware of that and is the Department taking any initiatives to try to increase connectivity from Ireland out of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Cork and our other ports not just to Britain but to continental Europe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a considerable range of routes and services at present.  Over the past ten years or so the overall capacity has increased significantly.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s comments regarding Stena.  Many of these services are partially passenger based but they are also freight based.  Politicians and other interested groups consider the tourism perspective and more people are probably flying in recent years and fewer going by sea routes.  What keeps the businesses going around the year is the freight rather than passenger side of things.  Roll-on, roll-off freight has probably declined less than lift-on, lift-off or other bulk traffic during the world recession.  There is a big capacity of routes, although I accept passenger and car routes such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire or Dublin Port are not what they were.  They are not as popular as they were ten years ago.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week in reply to a parliamentary question about sub-prime mortgage lenders, the Minister referred to the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s consumer protection code, which he stated requires lenders to &ldquo;act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers&rdquo;.  I would like to give the Minister an example of how that requirement is being adhered to in the real world.</P>
        <P>I was contacted by a constituent who, like so many others, is struggling to make ends meet in the current economic downturn.  She and her partner bought a house during the so-called boom years, when young adults came under intense pressure to get on the property ladder.  In their particular circumstances, they felt they had no option but to turn to a sub-prime lender for their mortgage.  With her partner having recently been made redundant just a month before the birth of their third child, they are both out of work and unable to meet their mortgage repayments.</P>
        <P>The couple went to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service for assistance, whose staff contacted their lender to ask for a six-month moratorium on their mortgage.  The lender&rsquo;s response was &ldquo;We do not do moratorium&rdquo;.  The lender would offer nothing but to reduce the mortgage by half for six months, not as a discount but as a deferral.  Under the arrangement offered, the couple would have to repay the difference over the following months, with half the mortgage paid now and the full mortgage to follow along with a &euro;100 additional sum per month to cover the difference until cleared.  That was the only option open to the couple and the Minister of State would agree it was no option at all.  They had to take it because they are desperate.</P>
        <P>The lender has unsurprisingly refused to pass on most of the recent interest rate cuts.  As of last month the people were paying a rate of 8.45%, only a 0.5% of a decrease since the European Central Bank first began cutting rates in October.  The lender has simply refused to pass on the other reductions in the lending rate.  Today, the ECB rate was decreased by a further 0.25% and I fear the lender will not pass on this cut either.</P>

        <P>It is clear the sub-prime leopard has not changed its spots.  For all the opprobrium it has rightfully received, the industry still engages in predatory practices aimed at squeezing every last penny it can from those with the least ability to pay.  The Government&rsquo;s response to this crisis has been entirely inadequate and has made matters worse by ensuring that low income people have even less money to pay their mortgages because of the income levy, the so-called pension levy and the increase in value-added tax.  It has refused to insist that interest rate decreases are passed on or to legislate for a moratorium on repossessions, apart from the minimalist six-month moratorium which applies only to banks benefiting from the recapitalisation scheme.  It has offered no protection to people who simply cannot pay.</P>
        <P>We are already beginning to see the consequences of this in the increasing numbers of repossessions coming before the courts.  How many people will have to lose their homes before this Government finally decides something must be done?  If the current global economic crisis <Col N="561"/>has taught us anything, it should be that a hands-off approach to the private sector simply does not work.  There must be a point at which the Government steps in and insists that private industries operate not only according to an aspirational code but under firm and clear regulations.</P>
        <P>A mandatory two-year moratorium on repossessions for all mortgage lenders should be the urgent first step in this process.  We must also look at legislation to allow the victims of aggressive lending practices to renegotiate mortgage terms, including allowing people on fixed rates to change to variable rates without incurring the extortionate penalties some lenders are charging.</P>
        <P>I am appealing to the Minister to consider the issues I have raised.  There are thousands across the State in a similar position to that of the constituents who contacted me, and their numbers will only increase over the coming months and, perhaps, years.  The refusal to properly regulate this industry played an enormous role &mdash; which should be clearly understood &mdash; in leading us into this crisis to begin with.  It is inexplicable that this Government has not learned from this mistake.</P>
        <P>I urge that the points I have made are taken on board and acted upon.  I hope measures will be announced in the coming week that will bring relief to the hard-pressed families throughout the country to whom I refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government took steps in October 2007, under section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, to provide for an appropriate system of authorisation and supervision, by the Financial Regulator, of retail credit firms engaged in specialist or so-called sub-prime lending and home reversion providers not previously subject to financial regulation in respect of lending activities.  The primary purpose of this amendment was to extend to the customers of these firms the benefit of the consumer protections provided for in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s consumer protection code.  This regulatory regime has been in place since 1 February 2008 and is being implemented by the Financial Regulator.  Consumer credit, including sub-prime lending, is also regulated in Ireland under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which makes detailed provision for the form and content of loan agreements and for the advertising of consumer credit.</P>
        <P>The consumer protection code requires all mortgage lenders to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers.  In addition, the consumer protection code sets out the requirements that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.  The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s CEO pointed out that the regulator considers this to include a requirement that lenders agree a remedial action plan with borrowers where it detects arrears starting to emerge and to try to assist such borrowers in managing their financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen.</P>
        <P>It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure that, as much as possible, difficulties in respect of mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings relating to home repossessions.  Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender.  The preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.</P>
        <P>The finalised recapitalisation scheme announced on 11 February last includes a new code of conduct for mortgage arrears, which has been issued by the Financial Regulator and which came into force on 27 February.  The new code applies to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residences in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders &mdash; including so-called sub-prime lenders &mdash; registered with the Financial <Col N="562"/>Regulator.  Under the mortgage arrears code, where a borrower is in difficulty the lender will make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule and will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.</P>
        <P>The two banks participating in the recapitalisation programme have each committed to delay commencing court proceedings for repossessions of principal private residences until after 12 months of arrears appearing where customers continue to co-operate reasonably and honestly with them.  In addition, the recapitalised banks have assured the Government that, in the normal course of events, they will make every effort to avoid repossessions.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance understands that other IBF members also make strenuous efforts to ensure that repossession is not attempted until every reasonable effort has been made to find an alternative.  These include the use of flexible procedures for the handling of arrears cases, which are aimed at assisting the borrower as far as possible and which recognise the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 in full.</P>
        <P>Following a 2008 examination of procedures in place within financial institutions to deal with arrears and repossessions, the Financial Regulator wrote to all regulated mortgage lenders on 16 December last with feedback.  Its letter sets out best practices for dealing with arrears that were identified during the examination.  The Financial Regulator is currently carrying out a further examination of mortgage lenders to ensure that they are in compliance with the specific provisions of the consumer protection code and the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  The examination will also review the application of the residential mortgage arrears and repossession procedures and practices in place in mortgage lenders, as advised to the Financial Regulator in 2008, to ensure that consumers are being treated fairly.  In addition, an update will be sought regarding the implementation of the best practices outlined in the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s letter of December last.</P>
        <P>If a consumer has a complaint about his or her mortgage, that complaint must first be made directly to the lender.  If the consumer is dissatisfied with the outcome of his or her complaint, he or she can then refer the matter for further investigation to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  All Members have met people who are affected by difficulties in this regard.  One of the difficulties is that people do not seek help early enough and instead try to hide from the problem.  All we can do is encourage them to come forward.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour on the part of both borrowers and lenders and, in particular, the need to factor into their financial decision-making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.  Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop debt problems.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording the opportunity to raise this important life-and-death issue, which relates to the need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the threat to the viability of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital and the midlands area caused by correspondence that was sent to personnel at the hospital yesterday.  This correspondence states that all temporary contracts will be withdrawn on 27 April next and that no replacements will be provided for those on maternity or sick leave.  I can only presume that a mistake has been made and that there will be no cutbacks to essential staffing levels at this hospital.  I am seeking a guarantee in this regard, particularly as people&rsquo;s lives depend on the provision of adequate staffing cover.</P>
        <P>The effect of this bombshell on the hard-working and extremely effective staff at the hospital has been immeasurable.  This random reduction of services is no way to run the health system, neither is it a proper way to treat staff who work flat out, often in untenable circumstances, and who, for the sake of their patients, give over and above what is required of them in their contracts.</P>
        <P>Patients and the staff to whom they have entrusted their care need the support of a reliable and trustworthy Department of Health and Children.  The protests earlier today outside the gates of Leinster House by associations representing those who suffer with cystic fibrosis and autism and the Carers Association prove &mdash; if such proof were needed &mdash; that people are not receiving the support they require.  These protests are merely a small representation of the anger and hurt people feel at the Government&rsquo;s betrayal.</P>
        <P>What can the staff of Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital expect for the future?  Should they accept the termination of their contracts at the whim of the Minister for Health and Children?  Does the Minister think it will console them to know that they are shouldering responsibility for the salaries of a huge number of managerial and administrative staff in the HSE whose positions should have been cut some months ago?  These positions are surplus to need but the staff who occupy them remain in place while essential front-line staffed are being axed.  Do these people believe the Minister has established a &euro;27 million pension fund in respect not only of one but of all of them?  The answer to these questions is no.  The personnel to whom I refer are not surplus to need and have an essential role to play.  The Minister for Health and Children has driven another nail into the coffin of patient care at Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital.  Those who die as a result of lack of essential medical personnel and care will be on her conscience.</P>
     
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This move to reduce staff is part of an ever-increasing pattern of health cutbacks being imposed on the sick, the elderly and the vulnerable.  The Minister for Health and Children is being obliged to enforce these cutbacks in order to cover the financial mismanagement of her Department.  The sick and chronically ill are bearing the brunt of the blunders which have been the hallmark of her tenure in the Department.  Forgoing essential treatment and services is not an option the Minister would personally have to endure.  What makes one human being different from another when it comes to accessing essential health services?  I have asked in this House on a number of occasions the reason France, with a population of 64 million, has a fast, efficient health service while this country, with a mere 4.3 million, sees people dying due to cutbacks, sacrificed on the altar of Government inadequacy and criminal and moral neglect.</P><Col N="564"/>

        <P>The Mullingar hospital is a valuable health facility for the midlands and is the only acute hospital between Dublin and Sligo.  It was placed in the top three hospitals countrywide in the recently released HealthStat data.  It has proved time and again that it is working to a very high standard, despite the Minister&rsquo;s failure to meet promises to complete phase 2B of the hospital&rsquo;s infrastructural development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The hospital has also suffered from the removal of the cancer unit, which has left seriously ill patients forced to travel long distances to access services which had heretofore been more than adequately provided locally.  However, it now faces not only being under-funded but understaffed, which is a major indictment of this Government&rsquo;s disregard for essential provision for the midlands.  I expect assurances from the Minister of State that the correspondence received yesterday by all staff at Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital was just another administrative error or, dare I say it, a sick April Fools&rsquo; joke.  Sanity must prevail.  I ask the Minister of State to give me a guarantee this evening that nobody providing front line services at this very efficient hospital will be let go on 27 April.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar forms part of the Dublin-Midlands Hospital Group and provides an extensive range of acute services to the population of Dublin and the midlands, in particular Longford-Westmeath.  The issue raised does not relate specifically to Longford-Westmeath General Hospital and the midlands area.  This is a national decision that applies equally across the public sector.  The numbers employed in the health sector have grown since 2005.  The recent exceptional deterioration in the economy and the public finances has necessitated the taking of emergency budgetary measures and means that a more strict approach to employment control in the medium term must be taken in the public sector generally and in the health sector.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided that, with effect from 27 March 2009 to the end of 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment or promotion; nor may an allowance be paid for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  The decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and the renewal of such contracts.  However, in the case of the health service the arrangements have been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible and that there will be flexibility in the filling of certain posts.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children wrote to the HSE on Monday of this week advising them of the Government decision.  In the wider context, it is important to note that there is provision for filling full-time consultant and therapy posts, subject to the approval of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance.  The Government is committed to protecting the quality of services and this mechanism will be of assistance in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised yesterday with the Taoiseach the issue of the back to work enterprise allowance.  I told him I had watched &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; the other night which carried an interview with a young man.  The programme was to do with unemployment and people who found themselves out of a job.  This man wanted to set up a new heritage business in the Grand Canal area.  The idea was that they would provide walking tours along the Grand Canal and <Col N="565"/>have podcasts, a barge on the canal and so on.  It seemed to be a worthwhile project but because he was unemployed he was having difficulty getting a loan from the bank to set up this initiative.  He then tried to determine if he was eligible for the back to work enterprise allowance, but unfortunately he was ineligible because he was not long enough on the dole.  To get the back to work enterprise allowance one must be on the dole for two years.  If one qualifies for the allowance one is also eligible to get start-up loans and money towards equipment needed for one&rsquo;s business and so on.  It is a very worthwhile allowance for which to apply and this man had a worthwhile proposal.  He could do with qualifying for this particular allowance, but unfortunately he was not eligible.  </P>
        <P>The point was made in the programme by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, which has made a budget submission in this regard, that the time one must be on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to qualify for this allowance should be reduced from two years to six months.  The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association has requested that the waiting time to qualify for this allowance be reduced from two years to three months.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach agreed with me yesterday when I highlighted this matter on the Order of Business.  He said we must examine these issues to ensure people who have ideas are not deprived of the opportunity to do something because of the application of an unrelated rule.  That gave me hope that the Government might consider changing the eligibility rule for the back to work enterprise allowance.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal of publicity surrounding the campaign where people are being asked to put their ideas on to a website.  Unemployed people with good business ideas could set up new businesses.  Individuals are being paid social welfare who could help build up our economy by establishing new businesses, but they are being hampered by the inflexibility of our rules on the back to work allowance, the back to work enterprise allowance, back to education schemes and so on.  At a time when so many people are going on the dole it is important to get them back to work and allow them set up new jobs in areas such as the one in which the man I mentioned earlier wanted to set up a business promoting our environment and our heritage, as opposed to building up our economy through speculation, development and so on, which was the case in the past.  We must ensure that our social welfare schemes do not prevent people from setting up new businesses, getting back to education and the workplace.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Department.  What the Deputy has outlined is very much what we are hearing when we meet people on the ground.  The long reply outlines all the good actions the Department takes currently but the most relevant is near the end.  I could read the five pages for the Deputy but the comment at the end states: &ldquo;In view of the particular relevance of the back to work scheme to the unemployed, the eligibility requirements and other aspects of the scheme are being examined to ensure they continue to meet the needs of individuals in the current climate.&rdquo;  There are many good actions the Department has always taken but there was always a period before they clicked in.  It must try to target resources at those who really need them rather than those who might almost deliberately become unemployed to get benefits.  That is not what is happening now but it might happen in the case of a few.   The increase recently in the number of people who have been made unemployed has brought all the schemes into focus, and they are being examined.  The reply outlines what currently exists but with the debate this week and discussions at Cabinet level, things are being looked at and the last paragraph is probably key.  We have all made suggestions at different levels and I hope some of the projects can be adjusted to help people who do not <Col N="566"/>want to be unemployed and who want to re-enter the workforce.  I do not know if they can go the whole way and make these available from day one, but the situation is being examined and I hope something good comes from that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I was prompted to raise the issue of Garda stations in County Meath by a petition some constituents from Dunboyne sent to me.  It is not the first time I have raised the issue of Garda resources in my constituency in response to a petition.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the great work garda&iacute; do day to day in my constituency in the fight against crime and dealing with serious accidents.  There was a serious robbery in Bettystown last night and I know from one of the victims that the garda&iacute; did an amazing job.  That incident, however, highlights some of the issues I am raising.</P>
        <P>There have been improvements in Garda numbers in Meath since the new division of Meath was created, after splitting the Louth-Meath division.  There are still towns, however, such as Stamullen and Ratoath, without Garda stations while Dunboyne and Duleek need improved facilities and 24-hour cover.  All of the towns I have mentioned were small villages that have grown hugely in recent years and are now big towns.  There is a perception in some of these towns that the lack of a Garda presence or 24-hour cover makes it easier for burglars and robbers to exploit them.  People worry that they are more likely to be victims of crime if there are no Garda stations in the town in which they live.  I wonder if the Minister might do some research into that.  If it is not true, we could allay people&rsquo;s fears.</P>
        <P>The perception certainly exists for my constituents, however, particularly those in Dunboyne who have contacted me recently.  Previously I have raised the concerns brought to me by residents groups in Stamullen and Duleek.  Despite the hard work of the well known garda&iacute; in Duleek, people believe further resources are necessary.</P>
        <P>My constituent who wrote to me stated with regard to Dunboyne that there has been a large increase in crime, particularly breaking into houses and cars, vandalism, robberies and violent attacks.  She said that with a significantly larger population the area needs a full-time Garda station and that local people are concerned about this and feel vulnerable.  According to my constituent, the robbers are aware of the situation and exploit it fully &mdash; sometimes people must wait an hour for a Garda response as a squad car could easily be 20 miles away responding to another call.  There is plenty of time for the robber to take what he wants comfortably and leave without being intercepted.</P>
        <P>That is the perception in the constituency and I would like the Minister to carry out research to see if the facts bear that out.  We should deal with these issues on the basis of facts.  The perception, however, exists and it is up to us to address it.</P>
        <P>In fairness to the garda&iacute;, there have been significant improvements in services and initiatives such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch are massively important and very popular.  I recently spoke at the launch of Beauparc-Yellow Furze community alert in my constituency and the event was very well attended, while a similar launch in Stamullen attracted large numbers.</P>
        <P>The garda&iacute; in Meath are well attuned to the needs of the community but they need further resources.  To give confidence to these communities and discourage criminals, a programme of Garda station building should be undertaken and those Garda stations that are not fit for purpose should be removed and replaced, while those Garda stations that are not open 24 <Col N="567"/>hours should be opened all day.  Not alone would such a programme benefit communities and the garda&iacute; who serve them, but they would also result in employment in the construction industry that is badly needed.</P>
        <P>Garda&iacute; are needed on the beat, and that is where they want to be, but the physical presence of a station is very important for a growing community and acts as a deterrent to crime.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, proposals on the opening and closing of Garda stations are matters for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the annual policing plans.  In this regard, significant developments have been under way in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to realign Garda divisional boundaries to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  One of the main aims of this project is to bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of the joint policing committees.</P>
        <P>These boundary changes have had significant positive impacts in County Meath in particular, with the establishment of a new Garda division in the county in June last year.  As part of the work of establishing the new division, a detailed analysis of the policing needs of the county was carried out, including an assessment of crime trends, population levels and policing requirements.  This analysis resulted in a re-alignment of the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations of the new division and the establishment of a new Garda district of Laytown.  This new district has been operational since 1 January this year.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with the establishment of the new division, there has also been a significant increase in the number of Garda resources allocated to the division.  The total personnel strength of the Meath Garda division on 28 February 2009 stood at 307.  This represents a significant increase of over 16% since the start of 2008.  In addition, a significant number of civilian staff are assigned to the division.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are monitored and reviewed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on an ongoing basis.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>Engagement with the community is a key priority of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this objective extends well beyond the physical presence of the Garda station, important though that is.  In this regard, any proposal to increase the number of Garda stations in the county would be incompatible with contemporary policing policy as it would result in valuable Garda resources being diverted from outdoor, operational policing to indoor administration duties.</P>
        <P>With regard to accommodation matters generally, the Garda Commissioner has established a Garda accommodation programme board, under the chairmanship of the chief administrative officer, to prepare a long-term accommodation strategy for the organisation.  This strategy will address a number of areas including the identification of future accommodation needs with particular reference to policy and policing requirements and taking into account international trends and perspectives.  It will also assess current buildings and facilities including their condition, location and development requirements.  The accommodation requirements for County Meath will be fully considered in this regard.</P>
        <P>I fully understand Deputy Byrne&rsquo;s point because County Meath has changed in recent years from being a rural area to being a suburb of Dublin, with a huge increase in population and a need for more garda&iacute; and Garda stations.  While constituents like to have a Garda station nearby, they are often not the relevant factor.  The important thing is the ability of garda&iacute; to <Col N="568"/>come to the scene of a crime when they are needed, rather than a garda sitting in the station who cannot come out because he cannot leave the station unattended.  The new division in Laytown will lead to better policing.</P>

	<P>There is substantial ongoing current and capital Exchequer investment in the development and operation of the Irish railway network.  Total Exchequer funding allocated to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for 2008 amounted to more than &euro;720 million and freight services benefit from this investment also.</P>
        <P>I propose to establish in the coming months a forum on the movement of goods as set out in Smarter Travel &mdash; A Sustainable Transport Future, which was published earlier this year.  My Department is currently undertaking preparatory work on the membership, tasks, and timescales for the forum.  The forum will address both economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability matters associated with the movement of goods by air, sea, rail, and road.  The realistic potential for rail freight and its role within an integrated freight transport strategy including issues such as a rail freight subsidy and international experience in the promotion of rail freight will be among the matters explored by the forum.  When the forum has deliberated, the question of introducing additional funding for the railways to promote rail freight will be considered at that time and also in the context of other demands for funding in the transport sector and the level of availability of Exchequer funding at that time.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present and of returning the rail freight business to profitability.  In that context, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has made progress in recent years in growing the rail freight <Col N="570"/>business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, e.g. large volumes or trainloads over longer distances, which are not time sensitive.  The rail freight market has been fully liberalised since 1 January 2007, and while no applications have been made for entry to the market to date, any expressions of interest would be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The position regarding the electrification of the rail network is that only the DART line from Malahide to Greystones is electrified at present.  Transport 21 provides for the completion of the electrified DART Underground project by 2015.  It is anticipated that the existing DART line will be extended (through electrification) as far as Balbriggan and that the Maynooth line would be electrified as far as Maynooth, and the Kildare line as far as Hazelhatch.  The start and completion dates of Transport 21 projects in planning, such as the DART Underground project, will in each case be determined by the outcome of public consultation, the statutory planning approval process, the public procurement process and the availability of financial resources.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 19 together.</P>
        <P>The Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform bus licensing to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants.  The legislative framework to support the authorisation and provision of improved public bus services in the Greater Dublin Area was updated last year through the passage of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, which establishes a new contractual structure relating to the provision of subvented bus services in the Greater Dublin Area.</P>
        <P>In January 2009, the Government approved the General Scheme of the Public Transport Regulation Bill which represents the second stage of the reform process and contains proposals for a new bus licensing regime which will replace the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.  In accordance with the Programme for Government commitment, the proposed licensing regime will provide a level playing field for all bus market participants.  The new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus passenger services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It will establish a clear structure against which applications for bus route licences will be considered as well as a modern system of penalties and associated powers for revocation of licences.</P>
        <P>The General Scheme of the Bill also contains proposals for extending nationally the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 in relation to the provision of public service obligations that are consistent with EU Regulation No. 1370/2007; assigning responsibility to the DTA for bus route licensing and public transport services contracts nationwide; the amalgamation of the Commission for Taxi Regulation into the DTA.  The scheme also provides for the renaming of the DTA as the National Transport Authority given its proposed national focus in relation to commercial bus licensing, bus and rail subvention and the regulation of <Col N="571"/>small public service vehicles.  In the light of the recent Government approval of the General Scheme of the Public Transport Regulation Bill, the Bill is now being drafted and it will be published as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) is, in line with Transport 21, continuing with planning and design to facilitate the preparation of an application for a railway order to An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la for the Metro West project.  Up to the end of February, the RPA has spent &euro;5.8m to progress planning and design. The start and completion dates for this project will be determined by the outcome of the statutory approval and procurement processes, decisions on Metro North, and the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate.</P>
        <P>Good progress continues to be made on the Metro North Project.  The first round of tenders for the Public Private Partnership contract were submitted on 27th February last and these tenders are now being evaluated by the RPA.  The Oral Hearing before An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la on the railway order application for Metro North commenced yesterday and the Board has indicated its anticipated decision date on this application to be before the 4th of September this year.  In these circumstances it is most unlikely that enabling works will commence in the current year.  However, both the RPA and my Department will keep the matter under review.  In accordance with the requirements of the Government decision on Transport 21, Metro North will be submitted to Government for a final decision on the project on the completion of the tender process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 41, 47 and 62 together.</P><Col N="572"/>
        <P>The response to any widescale disruption of public transport services due to strike action will be based on the optimisation of other travel modes such as cars, private bus services, taxi and hackney services, walking and cycling. It is premature to speculate on contingency plans when talks are continuing between the parties involved on the matter.  Regarding CI&Eacute;&rsquo;s finances, the company has projected an operating deficit of up to &euro;100 million in 2009 in the absence of corrective action.  The CI&Eacute; companies have prepared cost recovery plans, which, together with Exchequer subvention of &euro;313 million and an average fares increase of 10% for 2010, are designed to eliminate this deficit over the period 2009 and 2010. It is imperative that CIE achieves the measures necessary to restore its financial situation as it is not open to the State, under EU rules, to allocate funds to compensate for losses of the kind now being incurred.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to Dublin Bus services is that the company is currently seeking, with the assistance of the Labour Court, to secure agreement on a cost recovery plan involving, inter alia, a pay pause, some redundancies, revised work practices, and the withdrawal of some buses.  Decisions in relation to the deployment and withdrawal of buses are a matter for Dublin Bus.  I understand, however, that the withdrawal of 120 buses by Dublin Bus is driven by an increase in costs and falling passenger numbers and will be implemented so as to minimise the overall effect on customers and quality of service. Furthermore, I understand that the company wishes to implement their cost recovery plan with least impact on staff numbers.</P>
        <P>It is opportune also that the Deloitte report on the cost and efficiency of bus services, which Dublin Bus will be implementing, provides a framework for the development of a more efficient and effective bus service in Dublin carrying more passengers at a lower cost. The Review concluded that timetables are not sufficiently coordinated in areas served by multiple routes and that bunching is a significant problem due not only to congestion but also to a lack of even headways between buses. The Review also recommended addressing pinch points along corridors to ease congestion. I am certain that these recommendations when implemented will attract more people to become public transport users and ultimately protect the environment.</P>
        <P>I have been briefed by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann on their declining financial position, the cost recovery plans proposed to deal with this, and on the efforts being made to reach agreement with unions on the early implementation of these plans.  In the context of meetings relating to the bus cost and efficiency review, the unions briefed me on their position in relation to the proposed cost recovery plans.  As I indicated to the union representatives at those meetings, the reconciliation of industrial relations issues in CI&Eacute; and its subsidiary companies is a matter for the companies and the unions and, if necessary, the industrial relations machinery of the State.  Both Dublin Bus and its unions are participating in Labour Court hearings relating to Dublin Bus&rsquo; cost recovery and effectiveness plan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 45 together.</P>
        <P>The Deloitte Report, the recommendations of which I accept in full, sets out a series of measures which are designed to enhance the role of the bus.  In my statement accompanying the release of the report on 26th January, I indicated areas where the report had identified considerable scope within Dublin Bus to improve its services to customers, increase efficiencies and save money through, for example, redesigning the network, eliminating unnecessary service duplication and improving information to the customer.  In response to my request both companies have submitted detailed plans for the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations in line with the indicative timelines set out in the report.  My Department will shortly be responding to the plans and finalising the arrangement to be put in place for reporting on and monitoring implementation.  In the meantime, both companies have commenced work in relation to implementation.</P>
        <P>The early implementation of the recommendations in the report and other cost saving measures are vital for dealing with the current financial situation of both companies as it is not open to the State to compensate for the kind of losses now being incurred.  Furthermore, implementation of some recommendations in the report relating to bus priority, integrated ticketing, demand management measures, bus licensing and the move to PSO contracts are already being pursued by my Department in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, the DTO and the RPA where appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 23 together.</P>
        <P>The integrated ticketing system in the Greater Dublin Area is being introduced on a phased basis, based on smart card technology, over the period to the end of 2010. A progressive approach is being adopted to allow customers to familiarise themselves with using the new system and to permit transport operators to undertake the necessary testing with the integration of the technologies involved.  A smart card for Luas services has been available on all Luas services for some time. Smart cards are also now in use on Dublin Bus services in respect of a number of ticket products such as annual and monthly tickets, 5-day rambler tickets, and annual and monthly integrated bus and rail and bus and Luas tickets.</P>
        <P>The next step will be the launch by Irish Rail of an interim smart card scheme from late summer.  Following that, it is planned later this year to introduce a single smart card on a progressive basis for Dublin Bus and Luas services which will have electronic purse capability.  This capability will allow a pay-as-you-go system similar to the systems used for mobile phones and, when operational early next year, will facilitate cashless travel on services of all participating operators.  The single smart card will then be extended to Irish Rail DART and commuter rail services within the following 12 months. It is envisaged that private bus operators will join the scheme over this timeframe.</P><Col N="574"/>
        <P>During 2010, Bus &Eacute;ireann will introduce the single smart card system on a pilot basis on a number of its commuter routes within the Greater Dublin Area. The Company will then evaluate the feasibility of extending the scheme to include its whole network in the Greater Dublin Area.  Accordingly, during 2010 smartcards with an electronic purse will be available to almost all public transport users in the Greater Dublin Area.  The overall budget of the project is &euro;55.4 million.  While the current scope and focus of the single smart card scheme is the Greater Dublin Area, the mandate for the scheme is national in scope. The potential to develop a nationwide ticket will be reviewed when consideration is being given to expanding the Scheme on a national basis.</P>

        <Quest> if he has been briefed by the Dublin Airport Authority on proposals to postpone the development of a second runway at Dublin Airport and to apply for permission for a longer second runway; his views on these proposals; his further views on proposals for the development of new airport facilities including in the midlands and west Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Proposals in relation to the development of Dublin Airport are, in the first instance, a matter for the DAA, which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airport and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers.  Accordingly, any proposals for the postponement of the second runway or for the provision of a longer runway are matters that fall within the responsibility of the management and board of the DAA.  DAA received planning permission in August 2007 to construct a 3,110 metre northern parallel runway, subject to conditions.  Given the downturn in the economy, DAA has deferred the immediate construction of the runway.</P>
        <P>As part of the consultation process with users and the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR), DAA has indicated that it believes the most prudent approach to determining the construction start date for the Northern runway is to identify certain key trigger points that will signal the return to traffic growth.  The trigger mechanisms proposed by the DAA relate to the impact of such traffic growth on runway availability in demand for runway slots. Using these return to growth triggers should allow DAA to bring the new runway into service just as demand requires it.  While construction of the runway has been deferred, DAA is continuing with the planning and design of the runway project so that it can be ready to begin construction as soon as the triggers come into play.</P>
        <P>In relation to the development of new airports private interests may develop airports in whatever location they wish, provided that the requirements of the Irish Aviation Authority <Col N="575"/>are met and that planning permission is secured.  I should point out that the financial demands of running an airport are very challenging and it is, of course, a matter for the promoters to satisfy themselves that a new airport can function as a viable commercial entity.  My Department has no plans to support the development of any new airports.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 22 and 29 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is proceeding with preparations for the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority (DTA) as soon as possible during 2009. A key part of those preparations is the recruitment of a Chief Executive Officer and the necessary recruitment process is currently underway. In accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, final decisions on the provision of funding and staff numbers will be taken following the receipt of proposals from the Authority in that regard. The new CEO will also be responsible for sourcing suitable office accommodation for the Authority.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 14 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the Minister for Transport is responsible for appointing the members of the Dublin Transport Authority. Membership of the Authority will comprise a chairperson, 3 ex officio members and 6 ordinary members. The chairperson and 6 ordinary members must be persons who, in the opinion of the Minister for Transport have wide experience in relation to transport, industrial, commercial, financial, land use planning or environmental matters, the organisation of workers or administration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mr. Tom Mulcahy is chairperson designate of the new Authority. I recently announced my decision to invite applications from people who wish to be considered for appointment as an ordinary member of the new Authority. The application process is straightforward. Applicants must simply be able to demonstrate how they meet the criteria in the areas referred to above. The closing date for receipt of applications is Friday 24 April next. Full details of the application process have been published on the Department of Transport website www.transport.ie.  The purpose of the application process is to encourage people who believe that they can make a positive contribution to the development of the transport system in the Greater Dublin Area to put their name forward for consideration. The appointment of members is at my sole discretion and I reserve the right as to whom I appoint.</P><Col N="576"/>
        <P>The procedure for the appointment of the 24 members of the Dublin Transport Advisory Council is set out in section 17 of the 2008 Act. The procedure is quite detailed. However, in essence posts on the Council, apart from the post of chairperson, fall into 3 categories as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ex officio members,</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />members nominated by members of the local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area, by the Dublin and Mid-East Regional Authorities, by ICTU and by the Garda Commissioner, and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />members representing various interests, for example, business, community interests and the public interest.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">With regard to the last category, section 17 provides that the Minister for Transport may prescribe organisations which shall be invited to nominate candidates for membership of the Council in that category. I propose to invite applications in due course from organisations that wish to be prescribed for that purpose.</P>
        <P>In January 2009, the Government approved the General Scheme of the Public Transport Regulation Bill which contains proposals for a new bus licensing regime which will replace the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.  It is proposed that responsibility for bus licensing and public transport services contracts nationwide will be assigned to the DTA under the Bill, which will also provide for the absorption of the Commission for Taxi Regulation into the DTA.  The Bill will also provide for the renaming of the Dublin Transport Authority as the National Transport Authority given its proposed national focus in relation to commercial bus licensing, future bus and rail subvention and the regulation of small public service vehicles.  The Public Transport Regulation Bill is now being drafted and it will be published as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21. The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, including the Dublin Port Tunnel, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  I am required, under the terms of the EU Tunnel Safety Directive, to transmit to the Commission a report from the Tunnel Administrative Authority (the NRA) every two years setting out incidents which clearly affect the safety of road users in tunnels. The first such report was submitted by me as required by the Directive in September 2008. The Directive requires the Commission to make these reports available to all Member States.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 30, 42 and 49 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Taxi Regulation Act enacted by the Oireachtas in 2003, the taxi industry is regulated by the  Commission for Taxi Regulation which is an independent body responsible for the regulation of the taxi industry and many of the issues raised in these questions relate to the functions of the Commission.  The economic review of the small public service vehicle industry published recently by the Commission for Taxi Regulation contains a wide range of detailed data on taxi, hackney and limousine services, including data on hours worked, demand for and supply of services, double jobbing, earnings, and impact of liberalisation.</P>
        <P>The review confirms that there has been a large increase in the demand for taxi services with approximately 100 million trips last year &mdash; an increase of 25% since 2005, though I note from recent statistics that the number of applicants applying for taxi licences has dropped dramatically in recent months.  The review also indicates that, as a result of the increased supply of vehicles, drivers are operating in a more competitive environment and as a result drivers are working longer hours with an average of 52 hours per week and that average earnings have dropped slightly. As part of the public consultation process on the Goodbody Review, the Commission is seeking views on the recommendation about exploring methods for recording hours worked in order to deal with this issue and the related issues of safety.</P>
        <P>In relation to wheelchair accessible taxis, the percentage of the whole taxi fleet that was wheelchair accessible was 7.5% in 2008.  While this is a reduction from the percentage of the fleet that was wheelchair accessible pre-liberalisation, the actual number of wheelchair accessible taxis has actually increased, though not at the same rate as the overall expansion of the fleet.  There were 1,600 licensed wheelchair accessible taxis in 2008 &mdash; up from 1,246 in 2005.  The Commission has submitted proposals for a subsidy scheme to assist in the purchase of wheelchair accessible taxis and the issue is under consideration in my Department in the context of the overall budgetary situation, as are alternative means of ensuring accessible taxis.</P>
        <P>Overall the review concludes that liberalisation has resulted in significant benefits to the consumer in terms of more and better services and reduced waiting times and that the present regime should be maintained but that the focus be on strengthening quality standards and enforcement.  The Commission has now launched a public consultation process based on the <Col N="578"/>review. The Commission will also be engaging with the Advisory Council to the Commission which has as its duty to advise the Commission and the Minister on general taxi matters.  It is important that all stakeholders in the industry make their views known to the Commission by 4 May 2009. I will then consider the outcome of this process, the views of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, the views of the official representatives of the taxi industry, consumers and consumer interest groups insofar as they relate to my statutory responsibilities.</P>

	<P>I last met the Stakeholders Group regarding the major Transport 21 infrastructural works in Dublin on 11th March 2009.  Pending the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, the Dublin City Manager chairs the Dublin Transport 21 Implementation Group, which coordinates and oversees the Transport 21 investment programme in Dublin.  A Communications Sub-Group of this Group, which is chaired by Dublin City Council, has been formed and is preparing a co-ordinated communications Plan for the construction period of the major Transport 21 projects such as Metro North and the Dublin rail interconnector. A key theme of communications during construction works will be &ldquo;Dublin is open for business&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I have asked for a presentation on the communications Plan, which is being developed by the Transport 21 Communications Sub-Group, to be made to myself and to all stakeholders at the next meeting of the Stakeholders Group, which is scheduled for May 2009.  The communications campaign will be rolled out in advance of works on Metro North.  The commencement of works is subject to the grant of an enforceable railway order by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Oral Hearing on the Metro North railway order application commenced on 1 April 2009.</P>
        <P>On 12 February 2009, City Councillors approved the College Green Bus Gate to go to public consultation.  The consultation period closed on 27 March 2009.  The matter is due to be considered at the Strategic Policy Committee of the Council in April 2009 and by the full Council in May 2009.  The date for implementation of a bus gate, which offers significant benefits for bus passengers and Dublin Bus, will depend on the decision of Councillors, following discussion at these meetings.</P>

        <Quest> his policy on pricing and fares for rail and bus services; if he has conducted research on the effect of pricing policy on passenger volumes and take-up in transport here or compared pricing policy with other EU and OECD states; if he is examining more simplified models of commuter fares for bus and rail services; his views on the cancellation of certain commuter bus tickets (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Decisions in relation to fares for rail and bus services and the range of tickets offered to the public are, for the most part, a matter for the operators of those services. However, proposals for changes to the standard single fare charged by the CI&Eacute; companies and the RPA is, based on custom and practice, subject to control by me and such proposals are considered in the context of the overall impact on public <Col N="579"/>transport patronage, the cost environment and, in the case of loss making services, the level of availability of Exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>While I have not commissioned research on the effect of pricing policy on passenger volumes and take-up it is clear that excessive increases in fares will damage the attractiveness of public transport.  Accordingly I only authorise standard single fare increases when the companies concerned have made a sound financial case for any such increase. Leaving the design and control of promotional and incentive fares in the hands of the companies allows them to promote their public transport product.  In respect of the future, the Dublin Transport Authority will have the power to introduce a fares scheme for public transport in the GDA.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Very significant progress continues to be made on implementing the commitments relating to transport in the Programme for Government. We are continuing to invest in Ireland&rsquo;s transport infrastructure through Transport 21 and enormous progress has been made over the past three years.  The maintenance of a high level of investment in public transport has facilitated the provision of better and higher quality bus and rail services throughout the country as an alternative to the private car. Continued investment in public transport will have real benefit for the environment and for congestion reduction as a result of fewer private car journeys being made.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 (No. 15 of 2008) facilitates the establishment of a new Transport Authority with overall responsibility for strategic transport planning in the Greater Dublin Area. The Authority will be responsible for the integration of public transport services with an objective of service providers providing very high quality transport services to the public.</P>
        <P>In relation to the national road network, significant progress continues to be made in the delivery of the five major inter urban routes (MIUs) &ndash; from Dublin to the Border, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.   The M1 from Dublin to the Border was completed in 2007, while work on the other routes is underway.  Those portions of the routes that have been opened to traffic in the past few years have delivered significant reductions in journey times. Examples would include bypasses of towns such as Moate, Cashel, Carlow and Gorey.   Work is on target for completion of the MIUs by the end of 2010.  When the network is complete, very significant reduction in journey times will be achieved.</P>
        <P>In addition to the MIUs, the NRA continues to deliver on other vitally important road infrastructure such as the M50.  The provision of additional capacity on the M50, being delivered by removing the toll barriers, increasing the number of lanes and making the major junctions &lsquo;free-flow&rsquo;, is well underway.  The final elements of this work are also due to be delivered by 2010.  Reductions in journey times, through bypassing major towns and cities and the provision of sufficient capacity on our major road network will also serve to reduce pollution and improve the quality of life for all those affected as well as enhancing prospects for economic recovery.</P>
        <P>In addition to the commitments in the Programme for Government, the publication by me of Smarter Travel &mdash; A Sustainable Transport Future, the new Government policy on transport, offers a vision which aims to achieve a sustainable transport system for Ireland by 2020.  It sets out a series of integrated actions which aim to reduce travel distance and travel times by car, <Col N="580"/>offer alternatives to the car to the extent that by 2020 modal share for the car will have dropped from 65% to 45%, improve fuel efficiency through alternative technologies, and strengthen institutional arrangements to ensure effective delivery of this radical new approach to transport and travel.  The action period of 12 years is very ambitious in itself but the Smarter Travel strategy, together with the very significant investment taking place under Transport 21, will ensure Ireland has an excellent sustainable transport system in place by 2020.</P>

	<P>The air services market in the European Community was fully liberalised in 1992.   The operation of the market is governed by common rules which were recently updated and are set out in a European Regulation (No. 1008/2008).  This Regulation entered into force in November last year and has direct application in all Member States.  Under the common rules set out in the EU Regulation airlines can freely set fares for air services offered within the Community and this has been the case since 1992 when the market was first opened up.</P>
        <P>In the EU Regulation, new provisions have been introduced requiring greater pricing transparency.  When publishing or advertising air fares, airlines must now include all applicable conditions and all applicable taxes and charges which are unavoidable and foreseeable at the time of publication.  These pricing transparency provisions were introduced because the fare structure in the industry in recent years has changed significantly with many airlines now having differentiated pricing structures consisting of a basic fare with a number of optional pricing elements.  The new rules require greater transparency in pricing information but airlines still have full pricing freedom.  This will ensure that consumers have fuller information available to them in making their travel choices.</P>
        <P>The broader issue of consumer protection legislation falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment.</P>

        <P>Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework guiding Government investment in national roads and public transport up to 2015.  A number of road and public transport projects have already been completed, others will be completed this year and many are under construction or at planning.  My priorities for investment in national roads are the completion of the major inter-urban network by 2010, the progressive development of the Atlantic Road Corridor as well as the improvement of other key national primary routes and the targeted improvement of certain national secondary routes.</P><Col N="582"/>
        <P>On the public transport side, the provision of increased capacity will be a key consideration in determining investment priorities.  Given their potential to greatly increase capacity on the public transport network, Metro North and the DART Underground are key projects.  Investment in increased bus capacity and bus priority measures are also priorities.  The bus-related investment will be guided by the Deloitte cost and efficiency review of the CIE bus companies and the availability of current funding for public service obligations. The selection of projects and programmes will also be guided by the overarching priorities set out by the Minister for Finance for capital investment, namely strengthening the productive capacity of the economy and sustaining employment.  Particular attention will also be paid to projects which have network benefits.</P>
        <P>The planning of the major transport capital projects identified in Transport 21 is continuing and they will be released for construction as soon as they are through statutory procedures and the available financial resources permit and consistent with the priorities I have outlined.  While most of the funding for projects and programmes will be provided by the Exchequer, there is also a significant PPP content in Transport 21.  My Department is continuing to explore possibilities for procuring further projects through PPP.</P>

	<P>The start and completion dates for projects which are yet to commence construction, including Metro West, Luas Line BX/D, Lucan Luas, phases two and three of the western rail corridor and the DART underground, will be determined as appropriate by the outcome of public consultation, the statutory planning approval process, the public procurement process and the funding available during the current difficult economic climate.  The provision of increased capacity will be a key consideration in determining public transport investment priorities in the period ahead.  In that context, the DART Underground and Metro North, are particularly important rail investments as they form a core part of the planned integrated public transport network for the Greater Dublin Area envisaged by Transport 21.</P>
        <P>With regard to the railway safety programme, the first and second Railway Safety Programmes were completed over two five-year periods 1999-2003 and 2004-2008 respectively.  A Task Force on Railway Safety is currently meeting to finalise the third Railway Safety Programme which will run over the five-year period 2009-2013.   I expect to receive the Report of the Task Force shortly.</P>

	<P>Statutory responsibility for regulation of the travel trade rests with the Commission for Aviation Regulation. As the existing legislative framework for the regulation of the travel trade has been in existence since 1982 in May last year I asked the Commission for Aviation Regulation, to undertake a comprehensive review <Col N="583"/>of the travel trade legislation.  The purpose of the review was to assess the operation of the current regulatory arrangements and to recommend any reforms that may be warranted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following an extensive consultation process, the Commission submitted their report to me on 30 December 2008 which I have published on my Department&rsquo;s website www.transport.ie.  I am currently examining the Commission's findings and recommendations and I am consulting with my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, on the report&rsquo;s findings in the context of consumer protection policy generally.</P>
        <P>I met with the President of the ITAA on the 11 February last and my officials have had a number of follow up meetings with other representatives from the Association since that date.  The Department and CAR are aware of the concerns of the ITAA and its members regarding the current bonding requirements and the difficulties being experienced by the travel trade sector generally in the economic climate.</P>

It will, in conjunction with other measures that I will be announcing shortly, contribute to the achievement of my vision of increasing the modal share enjoyed by cycling to 10% of all journeys by 2020.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to confirm that the Cycle to Work scheme has recently been introduced in my Department and that an invitation has issued to staff to avail of this worthwhile initiative.  I am aware that the Department of Finance will in the near future be issuing a circular to all Departments to facilitate an homogenous scheme across the Civil Service.  The scheme in my Department will, in due course, be adjusted if necessary to conform with this.  As the Cycle to Work scheme is optional, the implementation of the scheme in the agencies under the remit of my Department is a matter for decision by those agencies.  It would however be my expectation that these agencies would also respond positively and offer the benefits of this scheme to their employees.</P>

Given the range of issues to be addressed in the new Smarter Travel policy, I expect that progress on the walking policy in 2009 will focus on researching best practice and identifying the issues so that we are in a better position to publish a policy in 2010.</P>
        <P>To progress this area I intend setting up an interdepartmental working group. This group will ensure that the new policy integrates best practice from existing initiatives, and identifies the necessary additional initiatives. In terms of &ldquo;home zones&rdquo;, the working group will consider <Col N="584"/>the issue of how road space can be best managed to ensure walking fully realises its potential. All such issues will be considered in the terms of existing work in the area and the Smarter Travel policy.  It is too early to say what the cost of the National Walking Policy will be.</P>

	<P>Local authorities were advised by my Department on 23 February that, in order to enable the Government to have maximum discretion in future allocations, the Department of Finance was reviewing the current level of contractual commitments in respect of Exchequer capital expenditure. Local authorities were advised that, as a temporary measure, they may not enter into new contractual commitments in respect of regional or local road projects to be funded by State road grants. That restriction will be reviewed following the forthcoming Supplementary Budget.</P>
        <P>The total capital allocation to the National Roads Authority (NRA) for its national roads investment programme for 2009 is &euro;1.44 billion. All but approximately &euro;50m of this year&rsquo;s allocation on national roads is already contractually committed and does not require prior Department of Finance approval.  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21. The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</P>

        <Quest> the estimated greenhouse gas emissions for the transport sector in respect of 2012, 2015 and 2020 in view of the recently changed economic conditions; if his Department has changed its targets for reducing transport emissions in view of the changed economic environment; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The production of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions projections is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency.  The latest such data available to my Department was published by the Agency in March 2009.  At that time, average transport <Col N="585"/>CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions for the 2008 to 2012 period were projected by the Agency to be in the region of 14.4 million tonnes. For 2015 and 2020, the projections were in the region of 16 and 18 million tonnes respectively. </P>
        <P>With regard to the likely effects of the current economic situation on future transport emissions, it is not possible, at this stage, to make such predictions with accuracy. However, the EPA have carried out sensitivity analysis on economy wide emissions. This &ldquo;economic shock&rdquo; analysis suggests that the projected impact is relatively small in the longer term, amounting to around a 2% reduction in economy wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.  The Government&rsquo;s aim is to achieve emissions reductions that are sustainable in the long term.  It is therefore vital to address the necessary changes in personal behaviour over the short, medium and long term as outlined in Smarter Travel, A Sustainable Transport Future.</P>

	<P>Good progress continues to be made on the Metro North Project.  The first round of tenders for the Public Private Partnership contract were submitted to the Railway Procurement (RPA) on 27th February 2009. These tenders are now being evaluated by the RPA.  The Oral Hearing before An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la on the railway order application for Metro North commenced yesterday and the Board has indicated its anticipated decision to be before 4th September this year.  In these circumstances, it is most unlikely that the enabling works which the RPA had planned to undertake (subject to securing an enforceable railway order) will commence in the current year.  However, both the RPA and my Department will keep the matter under review including any necessary adjustments in the Exchequer allocation of &euro;60m for the project in the current year.</P>
        <P>It is not anticipated that any private funding will be spent on the project this year and the Exchequer allocation for Metro North for future years will be decided in the context of the Estimates exercise for each year.  Funds raised for the project under Section 49 levy schemes, amounting to approximately &euro;33m to date, cannot be spent unless and until the RPA has secured an enforceable railway order.  As I have stated previously, I am not in a position, given its commerciality sensitivity, to give any information in relation to the cost of Metro North in advance of the completion of the PPP process.  In accordance with the requirements of the Government decision on Transport 21, Metro North will be submitted to Government for a final decision on the project on the completion of the PPP tender process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 56 and 125 together.</P>
        <P>As a truly global industry, the airline industry and the aviation sector more generally are particularly vulnerable in the current global economic downturn.  In the context of our national aviation policy, my priorities are to maintain the highest possible levels of connectivity between Ireland and key markets around the world to support economic and tourism activity and to ensure that the development of our airports facilitates this.  My Department will continue to closely monitor developments in the aviation sector that impact on these objectives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very sensitive to the employment implications of the downturn on the aviation industry, particularly in the labour intensive aircraft maintenance sector and I have kept in close contact with my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in recent weeks in relation to the employment implications of the proposed closure of SR Technics.  In this regard, I can confirm that my officials are in close contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to ensure that any viable proposals for aviation related projects to retain as many jobs as possible in aircraft maintenance are given serious consideration.  The Dublin Airport Authority has also committed to giving serious consideration to any commercial proposal put to it as regards access to the hangars formerly used by SR Technics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Turning to the Government&rsquo;s new airport departure tax, the introduction of which was announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the last budget in October 2008, it should be noted that Ireland is not unique in applying such a tax.  A number of countries within the EU apply similar taxes including the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand.  The rates for the Irish air travel tax at &euro;10 and &euro;2 are not unreasonable when compared to rates in other countries.  While I appreciate the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period, oil prices have fallen significantly this year and it should be borne in mind that aviation fuel remains completely exempt from Government tax.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 59 together.</P>
        <P>The text of the Road Traffic Bill, which, <i>inter alia,</i> proposes a reduction in the legal Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) level for drivers and measures for the mandatory testing for alcohol of drivers involved in road traffic collisions, is currently being drafted and is nearing completion.  Government approval will then be sought for publication of the Bill.  The Road Traffic Acts already provide that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may test a driver involved in a road traffic collision for alcohol.  The Acts also provide for the testing of drivers in relation to drugs.  A member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, if of the opinion that a driver is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle, may require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person to submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample.</P>
        <P>There is as yet no reliable system of preliminary roadside testing for drugs, but the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in this area.  In the meantime, the draft Road Traffic Bill includes provisions for &ldquo;field impairment testing&rdquo; i.e. non-technological methods by which the Garda&iacute; can make a preliminary assessment about the possible presence of drugs.  Another key provision in the draft Bill is a reduction in the blood alcohol content (BAC) level for drivers, and this takes account of the recommendation and proposed levels made by the Road Safety Authority last year.</P>
        <P>In response to the question on my role, I have responsibility for the road safety functions within the Department, which includes the Road Traffic Acts, corporate governance of the Road Safety Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, and the making of secondary legislation on issues such as driver testing and licensing, vehicle standards and the regulation of traffic.  I have been closely involved in all stages of the preparation of the draft Road Traffic Bill.</P>

        <Quest> the way he envisages the work programme and role of the National Roads Authority evolving or changing during 2009 and from 2010 to the end of Transport 21 in view of recent budgetary changes resulting from the financial crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In line with Transport 21, the work programme for the National Roads Authority for the next two years remains focused on the completion of the inter-urban motorway and dual carriageway network and the completion of the M50 upgrade by 2010.   Funding for these projects is already contractually committed and will ensure that the Government&rsquo;s objectives under T21 will be achieved. </P>
        <P>Sanction has been sought from the Department of Finance to proceed with the letting of contracts in respect of some &euro;50 million, all that remains of the NRA&rsquo;s capital allocation for 2009 which is uncommitted.  This includes the NRA&rsquo;s proposed programme of minor roadworks on both national primary and national secondary roads, as well as planning and preparatory work on a range of other projects.  I expect the Department of Finance will respond to my Department following the Supplementary Budget on 7 April next.</P>
        <P>The priority for the roads investment programme after the completion of the major interurban network, will be the Atlantic Road Corridor as well as the improvement of other key national primary routes and the targeted improvement of certain national secondary routes.  Decisions to proceed with projects will be taken from time to time in the light of the available public finance.</P>
        <P>As regards the role of the NRA, its primary function under the Roads Act 1993, as amended, is to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  There are no plans to change this function.  However, as the major construction and improvement programme moves towards completion in future years, the Authority will be increasingly focused on the renewal, maintenance and management of the network.  I will also work with the NRA to identify new ways in which its very substantial technical skills and construction programme management expertise can be put to use.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, as Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.  In 2007, the NRA forwarded a report on the feasibility of the construction of a Dublin Eastern Bypass to my Department. </P>
        <P>Neither Transport 21 nor the National Development Plan provides any funding for the project to be constructed in the period to 2015.  The Government has already made it clear that, <Col N="591"/>under Transport 21, its priorities for the national roads investment programme, after the completion of the major interurban network in 2010, will be the Atlantic Road Corridor as well as the improvement of other key national primary routes and the targeted improvement of certain national secondary routes.  It is clear that in the current economic climate, further progress on long term projects, such as the Eastern Bypass, will only be possible as and when resources become available.</P>
        <P>The Eastern Bypass proposal remains an important potential element of our longer-term infrastructure development.  My Department will continue to liaise with the roads and planning authorities concerned to ensure that route options are preserved free of impediment for this potential project.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in the reply to Question No 26 [13739] of 1 April 2009 all Departmental budgets are currently under review.  Any reallocations that result will reflect the funding priorities that have been agreed by the Government and the changes necessary to support their delivery.  Government funding of the Skillnets Training Networks Programme, which supports enterprise-led training in the workplace, has increased in recent years and has been indicative of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to upskilling persons in employment, with particular emphasis on those with low basic skills, to retain and enhance employability and maintain competitiveness.</P>
        <P>However, the changed economic and employment market situation has meant that many of the workers who would have benefited from training programmes for those in employment are now unemployed. In my view that means that we must adjust our training programmes to the new reality.  That is why my Department is implementing a number of initiatives to increase training for the unemployed.  This will mean refocusing some of the finite budgetary resources for training towards activation measures aimed at training greater numbers of unemployed persons. It is in this context that the Skillnets Training Network Programme allocation for 2009 is under review in the context of the forthcoming April Budget.</P>
        <P>I am aware that proposals have been made to my Department from Skillnets as to how the enterprise-led skillnets training network model might potentially be of assistance in the training and upskilling of the unemployed and of part-time workers.  These proposals are currently under discussion with the Department.</P>

	<P>Enterprise Ireland is the lead Government agency responsible for the development of indigenous Irish enterprise.  Its mission is to accelerate the development of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in world markets.  Enterprise Ireland delivers a wide range of supports to Irish companies, targeted at the specific requirements of clients throughout all regions <Col N="594"/>to ensure that they develop to their full potential in terms of innovation and exports, which in turn stimulates job creation. </P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is available to work with and support local entrepreneurs with commercial business plans and provides preferential funding for entrepreneurs and companies with detailed export plans who are expanding or establishing a business in Leitrim as part of the BMW Region.  In January 2009, a two-night Enterprise Start Introduction workshop was held in Carrick-on-Shannon with 17 participants.  A number of the participants were assigned a mentor to explore their business plans further, a number will progress to other programmes and a number were referred to Leitrim County Enterprise Board for further help.  Additionally, a Growth Fund Briefing for existing companies in the area was held in January 2009 to help companies explore new growth potential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of over &euro;2.3 million under the various CEC Schemes in support of Community Enterprise Centres in Co Leitrim.  These include Centres in Drumshanbo (the Food Hub and Drumshanbo Enterprise Centre), Carrick-on-Shannon (the Market Yard and Carrick-on-Shannon Business Park), Mohill, Drumkeerin, Ballinamore (Ballinamore Enterprise Centre and Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Enterprise Centre), Keshcarrigan and Manorhamilton (Manorhamilton Enterprise Centre and Manorhamilton Enterprise Forum).</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland also works with Leitrim County Enterprise Board, Leitrim County Development Board and Leitrim CDB Economic Development Sub-Committee to enhance economic development within the county.  To date in 2009 total funding to Enterprise Ireland clients in County Leitrim stands at &euro;247,649.</P>

<?oasys _cl14- ?>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as a general rule all vehicles imported permanently into the State must register for VRT purposes within one working day of arrival.  This rule applies equally to vehicles imported by EU and non EU persons.  In practice, Revenue allows latitude of a maximum of seven days for registration.</P>
        <P>However, section 135(a) of the Finance Act 1992 permits a European or other foreign registered vehicle which is temporarily brought into the State by a person established outside the State to be exempted from the requirement to register for VRT purposes for a period normally not exceeding 12 months from the date upon which the vehicle concerned was brought into the State.  Statutory Instrument No. 60 of 1993 prescribes the criteria for eligibility for the granting of temporary exemption on registration.  These provisions are in line with Article 39 of the EU Treaty, which provides for the free movement of people within the EU, and a reciprocal arrangement is also in place for our own State residents in fellow Member States.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that Revenue mobile units and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor both Irish and foreign registered vehicles on our roads as part of their regular and ongoing enforcement activity.  Additionally, regular national blitzes (i.e. short periods of concentrated activity involving numerous extra checkpoints, co-ordinated across the country, targeting evasion of VRT, VAT and the use of unmarked mineral oil) take place.  Such a blitz is now underway and featured prominently in the news bulletins on Sunday last, 29 March 2009.</P>
        <P>For their part, Revenue mobile units challenged 20,669 vehicles in 2008.  Of these some 15,321 satisfied Revenue officials that the registration status was in order at that particular time and no further action was taken, 5,438 vehicles required further investigation and action including registration and payment of VRT, seizure of vehicle, export of vehicle, grant of transfer of residence relief or temporary exemption, and reports for prosecution.  In addition to the VRT collected, penalties in excess of &euro;1.1 million were imposed in respect of these vehicles.</P>
        <P>In 2008, 55,819 used passenger vehicles were registered and the total VRT paid thereon amounted to &euro;190 million, while there were 28,727 used commercial vehicles registered and the total VRT paid thereon amounted to &euro;6.8 million.  There is some evasion of VRT, with individuals delaying registration as long as possible.  The Deputy will be aware that legislative provisions in the recently enacted Finance (No.2) Act 2008 (Sections 62 and 64 refer) tighten up the rules in relation to the registration of second hand vehicles and the late payment of VRT.  Section 62, in particular, allows the Revenue Commissioners to raise an estimated assessment of additional VRT in situations where the tax has not been paid within the prescribed period.</P>
        <P>In relation to the registration of second hand vehicles by dealers who are either not TAN (Trader Account Number) holders or who are abusing their authorised status, Revenue officials are constantly monitoring potential evasion of VRT and VAT.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that new measures to cancel an authorisation to hold unregistered vehicles introduced since the 2008 Finance Act are being implemented in specific cases of abuse of the authorised dealer status.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that VRT evasion can lead to distortion of competition.  The measures I have introduced in the Finance (No.2) Act 2008 are part of the response.  Ongoing enforcement activity by the various agencies within the sector &mdash; the Road Safety Authority, the Garda, the local authorities and Revenue &mdash; ensure compliance with all aspects of traffic management of the national vehicle fleet.  Indeed, it should be borne in mind that the right to import a vehicle, register it and pay the appropriate taxation on time is protected and honoured by the majority of those who source their vehicles abroad.  Notwithstanding this, I believe the measures introduced in the Act will improve the regulatory framework for all in this area.</P><Col N="596"/>

        <P>If the Deputy has any specific information relating to any potential abuses of VRT or VAT legislation and regulations in the State, details may be forwarded on a confidential basis to the Case Management and Enforcement Units in any Revenue District.  Revenue&rsquo;s enforcement officials will act upon any such information received.  Finally, matters relating to road tax are within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and matters relating to parking fines, speeding fines and penalty points are within the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Public servants who are members of public service pension schemes are liable to pay the pension-related deduction legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. On this basis, third-level researchers on fixed-term and temporary contracts must pay the deduction, since they are members of the relevant occupational pension schemes. They are just one of many groups of non-permanent public servants paying the deduction. Distinctions between public servants on the basis of whether they are permanent or temporary, and if temporary what contract duration applies, are irrelevant insofar as liability to pay the deduction is concerned. The pay of the post, in terms of whether it features incremental progression, is likewise irrelevant.</P>
        <P>In recent years fixed-term researchers in third-level institutions have been made pensionable, and this has significantly improved the attractiveness of a research career. These researchers accrue pensionable service even for short-duration appointments and that service can be aggregated with past and future service in other pensionable public service employment.  Section 6 of the Act provides for a refund of the deduction in certain circumstances, and should reassure third-level researchers on short-term non-renewable contracts who have no prior public service employment history and who may be concerned about accruing no pension benefit at the expiry of their contract due to insufficient service. A deduction refund may be payable provided that the departing employee has accrued no benefits under any public service pension scheme, has not received a payment in lieu of scheme membership and has not transferred the service to another public service pension scheme.</P>
        <P>Section 8 of the Act grants the Minister for Finance a limited special discretion to exempt groups of public servants from payment of the deduction. Specifically, where he is satisfied that due to exceptional circumstances, a particular class or group of public servants are materially distinguished from other classes or groups who are subject to the deduction, then the Minister may fully or partly exempt this group from paying some or all of the deduction, if he believes it would be fair and equitable to do so.  The deduction is required at a time of great pressure on the public finances and takes account of the valuable pension benefits available to public servants.</P>
        <P>In light of all the above factors, I am satisfied that it is fair and appropriate that public servants on fixed-term and temporary contracts, including third-level researchers, are subject to the pension-related deduction. In the event that any class or group of public servants makes an appeal for exemption from the deduction under section 8 of the Act then such an appeal will be considered.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has produced an outline design for a preferred flood relief scheme for the town of Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford and has just completed a formal public exhibition of that design, as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  This outline design was completed by internal Engineering staff within the OPW in consultation with Enniscorthy Town Council and Wexford County Council.  External Consultants, Royal Haskoning were appointed to produce an Environmental Impact Statement and a property survey was also procured externally through Research Ireland.  OPW has also provided funding to Enniscorthy Town Council for initial design work on a replacement bridge for the existing Seamus Rafter Bridge.</P>
        <P>Total costs associated with the proposed scheme since Wexford County Council and Enniscorthy Town Council asked OPW to develop flood relief proposals in 2001 are &euro;169,744.38.  Information is not readily available to quantify the cost of the time spent on the proposed scheme by OPW personnel, who have been working on a number of other projects contemporaneously with Enniscorthy.  OPW will now examine observations made arising from the public exhibition and ongoing consultation with interested parties and will make decisions in relation to the progression of the proposed scheme once this process is completed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I met with one of the insurance brokers&rsquo; representative associations on 17 February last.  The specific issue they highlighted was in relation to the conclusions drawn in a recent Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which was conducted by my Department. This recommended that, when amending the Insurance Mediation Regulations (S.I. No. 13 of 2005), the existing regulatory regime should be maintained for accountants that perform insurance mediation business on an ancillary basis. However, the RIA also made a number of recommendations which were aimed at making the existing Approved Professional Body (APB) regime more transparent. In particular, the RIA recommended that the current benchmark for determining ancillary business should be reviewed.</P>
        <P>The representative association had argued strongly against the retention of the existing APB regime during the RIA process. On the other hand, the accountancy representative bodies argued the contrary position equally strongly. In those circumstances, it was appropriate that particular emphasis should be given to the position of the Financial Regulator, in view of its role in regard to the supervision of insurance intermediaries, as well as its statutory responsibility for consumer protection.  The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s assessment was that the current APB regime delivers effective regulation in a rigorous, independent and professional manner.  The Financial Regulator confirmed to the Department that there is no evidence that the APB supervisory regime is less effective than direct regulation by the Financial Regulator.  As far as the impact on consumers and the rights of citizens are concerned, the assessment of the Financial Regulator is that customers are best served by the retention of the present APB arrangement for insurance mediation.</P>
        <P>At the meeting referred to earlier, the association disagreed with this conclusion and, consequently, I offered to ask the Financial Regulator to re-examine its assessment.  The Financial Regulator is at present analysing the counter arguments put forward by the association and I await the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s further assessment with interest.</P>

        <Quest> if he will accept a proposal from an organisation (details supplied) to exempt both basic banking and insurance products from the consumer protection code. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I would like to point out to the Deputy that the decision on any exemptions from the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (CPC) is a matter for the Financial Regulator under Section 117 of the Central Bank <Col N="602"/>Act 1989. I only have the right to be consulted when the Financial Regulator draws up, amends or revokes one of its Codes of  Practice.</P>
        <P>The CPC already contains some exemptions from its requirements for the provision of a &ldquo;basic banking product or service&rdquo;. Such a product or service is excluded from the &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer&rsquo; and &lsquo;Suitability&rsquo; provisions of the CPC when certain criteria are met. A &ldquo;basic banking product or service&rdquo; is defined in the CPC as &lsquo;a current account, overdraft, ordinary deposit account or a term deposit account with a term of less than one year&rsquo;. A bank must first establish that the consumer is seeking a basic banking product and when the bank has established that this is the case must advise of any restrictions on the account and of any lower cost alternatives that may be available from the bank.</P>
        <P>Unlike basic banking products, which are designed to be generically suitable for all, insurance products are affected by the individual circumstances of consumers. For example, when a consumer is purchasing a life assurance policy the policy detail and price may be affected by whether the consumer is a smoker or not. Similarly in motor insurance the age and accident history will have implications for the insurance policy offered. Therefore it is appropriate that the CPC fully applies to these products.</P>

	<P>In progressing the agenda for the reform of the Irish financial regulatory system, the Government will make appointments to the regulatory authority based on the authoritative standing, expertise and experience of individuals.  The Financial Services Consultative Industry Panel is intended to be representative of the industry as a whole and no particular organisation or group is automatically appointed. When making appointments to the Panel, I seek to ensure that over time a broad range of relevant interests is, as far as possible, appointed. The organisation referred to by the Deputy has in the past served on the Industry Panel and I would expect that it will be asked to do so again in the future. In the meantime, the organisation is of course welcome to express its views on financial services issues to the current Panel. </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the redemption fee applied by mortgage providers in circumstances that a customer seeks to break a fixed rate mortgage. Mortgage lenders in Ireland generally seek to recover costs of funds when a borrower with a fixed rate mortgage agreement seeks to terminate the agreement some time before the term agreed.  Traditionally redemption fees were articulated with the institution <Col N="603"/>specifying that a given number of months interest would apply. Overtime, they have generally moved towards a mechanism which reflects the difference between the contracted rate and current market rates applied to the amount outstanding for the remaining fixed period. Where a redemption fee is payable on a housing loan the mortgage agent has to inform the consumer about it at the outset.</P>
        <P>Compensation sought by the lender reflects the cost to the institution of having ensured the availability of funds on the capital market at a certain cost, as against selling them on at a related price. Institutions fund the fixed rate agreement through funding on markets, generally through interest rate swaps. This allows them to hedge their exposure to interest rate fluctuations.  Where the borrower seeks to repay the loan before the contractually agreed fixed term in an environment where interest rates have declined, the institution is exposed to re-investment risk, i.e., it will be unable to re-lend the funds at a rate related to their cost, due to intervening market fluctuations.</P>
        <P>Ireland is relatively unusual in the EU context in that borrowers have an absolute legal right to repay their loan early as set out in Section 121(1) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. However Section 121 goes on to recognise that while a consumer will not be liable to pay an early redemption fee with respect to a variable rate loan, this exemption from redemption fees does not apply where the rate of interest is fixed or is fixed for one year.  The Deputy may wish to note that as part of the preparations for the EU White Paper on Mortgage Market Integration, the Mortgage Industry and Consumers Expert Group agreed that lenders should receive a compensation when a consumer repays his or her fixed rate loan earlier than at its contractual termination.</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has advised my Department that there had been a recent issue involving an institution which allowed, without charge, a number of customers to switch from fixed to variable rate mortgages but this practice was discontinued as the number of customers, and the cost, increased substantially.  There are significant benefits for both individual householders and for the stability of the housing and financial sector overall from greater take-up of fixed rate mortgages. I do not believe that it would be wise to embark on any course of action which could impact adversely on the cost and availability of fixed rate mortgages in the future.</P>

	<P>Tax relief was provided in the Finance (No 2) Act 2008 where an employer provides a bicycle for an employee.  My Department is currently examining the best practice in implementing the scheme particularly in relation to procurement, warranty and insurance issues. Advice on these issues has been sought from the State Claims Agency, Chief State Solicitors Office and Office of the Attorney General.  Once clarification has been received, the Department of Finance will issue a circular providing for a scheme in the Civil Service and this scheme can provide a framework for a similar scheme in the wider Public Service.</P>

	<P>Legal advice which I obtained in 2004 strongly indicated that Female Genital Mutilation would constitute an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  In September 2006, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in its concluding observations on Ireland&rsquo;s second period report urged Ireland to continue its efforts to end the practice of Female Genital Mutilation through, <i>inter alia,</i> prohibiting it by law.  I am currently examining the question of introducing specific legislation to ban Female Genital Mutilation in the context of the UNCRC&rsquo;s recommendations.  I am not aware of any evidence that Female Genital Mutilation is being carried out in Ireland among established migrant ethnic communities now living here.</P>

	<P>Under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme general practitioners hold one of two contract types, i.e., the fee per item contract (first introduced in 1972) or the capitation contract (effective from 1989).  Fee per item contract GPs are paid a fee per visit by a GMS  patient and under the capitation contract, GPs are paid a yearly capitation fee per patient.  The capitation fee paid by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to the GP varies depending on the age, gender and distance of the GMS patient&rsquo;s home from the GP&rsquo;s surgery.  Over 99% of GPs contracted by the HSE to provide services under the GMS Scheme do so under the capitation contract.</P>

	<P>I have consistently emphasised the need to improve facilities and services to persons with cystic fibrosis.  Some 48 additional staff (19 at St Vincent&rsquo;s), including consultant, nursing and allied health professionals, have been appointed across the hospital system in recent years to enhance the level of services provided for persons with cystic fibrosis.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital is the national adult tertiary referral centre for patients with cystic fibrosis.  A number of capital projects to improve the quality of accommodation have been completed at the hospital.  These include the refurbishment last year of accommodation to provide eight single en-suite rooms for the exclusive use of people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>The eight single rooms have improved the quality of service for people with cystic fibrosis. The hospital&rsquo;s management works closely with doctors caring for cystic fibrosis patients to ensure that the needs of those patients requiring treatment are met within the overall bed complement at the hospital.  It is intended that a proposed 120 bed development will include dedicated facilities for patients with cystic fibrosis.  These facilities will include appropriate isolation facilities.  Design work and preparation of tender documents continue in respect of the development.  A number of other significant capital developments are being progressed for cystic fibrosis patients throughout the country, including in Beaumont Hospital.</P><Col N="607"/>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s Expert Advisory Group on Children and Families produced a draft policy document on the implementation of a cystic fibrosis screening programme for newborns.  A Steering Group will be established in 2009 to oversee the roll out of the screening programme.  An independent register for Cystic Fibrosis has been established.  It is expected that preliminary data to fully inform analysis relating to median survival here will be available by the third quarter 2009.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that further improvements are required, including the need to develop community outreach services to facilitate the treatment of patients outside of a hospital setting where appropriate. Taken together, the planned developments represent a tangible improvement in the quality of services for people with cystic fibrosis.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the scheme for the Civil Service is being dealt with by the Department of Finance. It is understood that implementing the scheme in the Civil Service has given rise to a number of issues, particularly in relation to procurement, warranty and insurance.  I understand that the Department of Finance has raised these issues with the State Claims Agency, Chief State Solicitors Office and the Office of the Attorney General.  Once these issues have been clarified, the Department of Finance will issue a circular providing for a scheme in the Civil Service and this scheme will provide a framework for a similar scheme in the wider Public Service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I would like to emphasise that as Minister for Transport my focus is on ensuring that viable and sustainable air transport services operate from Irish airports.  This will continue to have the potential to generate aviation <Col N="610"/>related job creation, whether in aircraft maintenance or other spin-off activities in and around our airports.</P>
        <P>As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s specific questions in relation to SR Technics, in mid January my Department was informed by the DAA that as part of preparations for global restructuring SR Technics had agreed to sell certain hangars back to the DAA and had signed a letter of intent to that effect.  I was informed of these developments at the time.  The Department and I had been made aware by the DAA in mid November of contacts between SR Technics and the DAA about possible restructuring of SR Technics and as a consequence the possible return of hangar leases.   The DAA advised that as they had signed a strict confidentiality agreement with SR Technics, they were therefore precluded from providing the Department with details of the discussions at that stage.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in late December the Department were advised by the DAA that these discussions were progressing but were still subject to a strict confidentiality agreement and that any restructuring of SR Technics could have a significant impact on employment in the Dublin operation.</P>
        <P>As regards contacts with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, once it became clear in November 2007 that the Aer Lingus maintenance contracts were being put out to tender, my Department alerted the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the potential implications for employment in the event that SR Technics were not successful in the tender competition.  Since then there has been ongoing contact with that Department, including contact between the T&aacute;naiste and myself, in the context of the threat to jobs.</P>
        <P>As already indicated to the House, both the Department and the DAA have at all times been sensitive to the employment implications of SR Technics closure.  I can also confirm that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are continuing to work intensively to ensure that any viable proposals for aviation-related projects to retain as many jobs as possible in aircraft maintenance are given serious consideration.  The DAA will also give serious consideration to any commercial proposal put to it as regards access to hangars for aircraft maintenance operations.</P>

	<P>Statutory responsibility for regulation of the travel trade rests with the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  As the existing legislative framework for the regulation of the travel trade has been in existence since 1982 in May last year I asked the Commission for Aviation Regulation, to undertake a comprehensive review of the travel trade legislation.  The purpose of the review was to assess the operation of the current regulatory arrangements and to recommend any reforms that may be warranted.  Following an extensive consultation process, the Commission submitted their report to me on 30 December 2008 which I have published on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.transport.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>I am currently examining the Commission&rsquo;s findings and recommendations and I am consulting with my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, on the report&rsquo;s findings in the context of consumer protection policy generally.  I met with the President of the ITAA on the 11 February last and my officials have had a number of follow-<Col N="611"/>up meetings with other representatives from the Association since that date.  The Department and CAR are aware of the concerns of the ITAA and its members regarding the current bonding requirements and the difficulties being experienced by the travel trade sector generally in the economic climate.</P>

	<P>Notwithstanding the current difficult economic climate, this Government is committed to continuing investment in the national road infrastructure.  The priority up to end 2010 will be the completion of the five major interurban routes (MIUs).  Significant progress continues to be made in their delivery. The M1 from Dublin to the Border was completed in 2007, while work on the other routes is underway and on <Col N="612"/>schedule for completion in 2010.  In addition to the MIUs, work is underway on the upgrade of the M50 which is also due for completion in 2010.</P>
        <P>The NRA&rsquo;s current construction programme is proceeding on time and within budget.  I expect this to continue to be the case right up to the completion of the MIUs.  As all of this work is contractually committed, the current economic situation will not impact upon delivery targets.  The priority for the roads investment programme after the completion of the major interurban network will be the Atlantic Road Corridor as well as the improvement of other key national primary routes and the targeted improvement of certain national secondary routes.  Decisions to proceed with projects will be taken from time to time in the light of the available public finance.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Agreed Programme for Government commitment, the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 was enacted in July 2008 and provides for the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, the DTA.  For the first time, we have the law in place to ensure that a single body will be in charge of surface transport in the Greater Dublin Area. The DTA Act 2008 gives the new Dublin Transport Authority the power to procure public passenger transport services through the making of public transport services contracts.</P>
        <P>Under section 48 of the Act, the DTA may enter into contracts following open tendering in respect of public bus passenger services, as well as metro and light rail services.  It also provides that public bus and rail services can be secured by means of direct award contracts.  Section 52 provides that direct award contracts will only apply to the continued provision of the services currently being provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Accordingly, the future growth in the market for subvented public bus services in the Greater Dublin Area will be pursued by way of open tendering in accordance with the new EU Regulation No. 1370/2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road, which will become mandatory from December this year. All contracts will be framed against the background of EU law and will set strict standards of operational performance and customer service and will contain penalties for non-performance.</P>
        <P>The Government has recently approved the General Scheme of the Public Transport Regulation Bill which contains proposals for a new bus licensing regime which will replace the Road <Col N="613"/>Transport Act 1932, which applies to the licensing of private bus operators, and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.  In accordance with the Programme for Government commitment, the proposed licensing regime will provide a level playing field for all bus market participants, both public and private. It is envisaged that the new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann and will encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the Greater Dublin Area that are consistent with the new EU PSO Regulation.  In the light of the recent Government approval of the General Scheme of the Public Transport Regulation Bill, the Bill will now be drafted and published as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In relation to air travel, the Government&rsquo;s policy is to promote regular, safe, cost effective and competitive air services linking the country and key business and tourism markets. The priority, from an Irish economy perspective, is to maintain the highest possible levels of connectivity between Ireland and key markets around the world.  All carriers serving the Irish air transport market are encouraged to compete on fares and on quality of service for the benefit of the travelling public.  Decisions in relation to the development and maintenance of transport services, whether in competition with other modes of transport or not, are a matter for transport service providers.</P>

        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy for the period 2008-2010 sets out our overall aviation strategy for the period. In general terms, the aim is to promote the development of regular, safe, cost-effective and competitive air services linking the country to key business and tourism markets around the world.</P>
        <P>Our policy on the development of airport infrastructure within the country is in line with our approach to the encouragement of air services. The main objective is to ensure that the three State Airports have sufficient capacity to respond to the needs of a competitive airline sector, and to provide vital international access. The programme of investment at Dublin Airport including the provision of Terminal 2 will allow Dublin Airport to respond to the requirements of carriers offering a wide range of long haul, short haul and cargo services and will ensure that the airport continues to be an efficient gateway to the Ireland of the 21st century. New governance arrangements which have now been agreed will provide an opportunity for Cork Airport to realise the potential provided by the very substantial investment in the airport in recent years. Shannon Airport will also be in a strong position to reap the benefits of US pre-clearance facilities, due for introduction at the airport in mid 2009.</P>
        <P>The regional airports complement the role of the State airports by helping to ensure that the benefits arising from their success as international gateways are widely distributed throughout the country.  We will endeavour to maintain support for their activities insofar as the current difficulties with the public finances permit, as part of a balanced approach which also empha<Col N="614"/>sises the need for the airports to operate on a sustainable commercial basis to the greatest extent possible in serving the needs of their respective catchment areas.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service that a foreign national who is granted permission to come to Ireland for the purpose of engaging in a course of studies is permitted to take up employment on a casual basis. The relevant immigration permission which is granted to the student indicates that the student is only permitted to remain in the State to pursue his or her studies on condition that he or she does not engage in any business or profession other than casual employment (defined as 20 hours per week during school term and up to 40 hours per week during school holidays).</P>
        <P>Work restrictions imposed on students are monitored whenever a student seeks to renew their registration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. For this purpose An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks a full financial record from students for the previous three months to ensure that they are not exceeding the work limits imposed on them.  Where it appears that financial records are inconsistent with compliance to the limits by the student, they are asked to produce their payslips.</P>
        <P>A person who is in breach of the conditions attached to his or her immigration permission, including limits on employment, is liable to have his or her immigration permission being revoked or not renewed. In this regard, the immigration authorities when engaging with students do take steps to monitor adherence to conditions and take appropriate action where concerns arise.  Where it is found that a student is consistently infringing the work limits imposed under Student Permission Stamp 2 an application may be made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service to consider the deportation of that person.</P>
        <P>To date in 2009, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made 113 applications under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, twenty-nine (29) of which refer to students who were considered to be in breach of these conditions. Fifteen (15) of the applications were for students who were working in breach of their conditions in the following sectors: restaurant (5), services (1), entertainment (1), construction (1), taxi driver (1) and cases where the sector is unknown (6) (i.e., nature of employment not specified on the original application received by the Garda National Immigration Bureau).</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that my Department is currently carrying out a review of student immigration. That review will address certain aspects of student migration from outside the EEA which have given rise to concern in recent years. It will also identify proposals for a more coherent approach to student migration generally. It is expected that the review will be completed shortly and will then be the subject of further consultation with other relevant Government Departments in relation to any proposed measures to be brought forward.</P>

	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management closely monitors crime trends in the area referred to by the Deputy and has put strategies in place to prevent, detect and reduce the number of incidences of this type of crime.  The Divisional Scenes of Crime Unit provides a flexible and immediate response to emerging crime issues.  The Unit liaises with the Divisional Detective Inspector to identify and monitor crime trends as they are emerging.</P>
        <P>The area is patrolled regularly by uniform and plain clothes units, including the Community Policing Unit.  Members of the local Community Policing Unit allocated to this area liaise with the local community providing crime prevention and security advice.  Patrols are supplemented by the District Garda Mountain Bike Unit supplemented by the District and Divisional Detective and Drugs Units, the Divisional Crime Task Force and the Traffic Corps.</P>
        <P>Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.</P>

	<P>The Government has approved the assignment of a site owned by the Department of Defence to the Irish Prison Service as the location for the development of a new prison facility to replace Cork Prison and to serve the Munster Region.  A preliminary site suitability report has been carried out on the site and this has confirmed that there are no significant constraints to the development of the site.  In accordance with the Department of Finance Guidelines, a preliminary Business Case has been prepared. The next stage of the process is the preparation of a detailed Business Case. However, given that this project is still at the preliminary stage it is not possible to put a time scale on the development at this time.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 6 August 2003 and applied for asylum on 18 September 2003. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 23 February 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, i.e. why he should not be deported.</P><Col N="617"/>
        <P>His case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf by his legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 17 October 2006, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered letter dated 15 November 2006 inviting the person concerned to make an application for Subsidiary Protection on foot of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 which came into effect on 10 October 2006. By correspondence dated 6 December 2006, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by his legal representative. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The person concerned and his legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 20 May 2008.</P>
        <P>Following the refusal of the Subsidiary Protection application and the consideration of further representations concerning the personal safety of the person concerned if returned to his country of origin, the Deportation Order was affirmed. The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 10 May 2007.  Notice of the affirmed Deportation Order was served by registered letter dated 18 March 2009 requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 26 March 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. The person concerned presented as required and is due to present again on Tuesday 7 April 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 141, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that all files relating to complaints deemed finalised by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board up to and including 2005 have been destroyed.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board consulted with my Department, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Office of the Attorney General before taking its decision to destroy these files.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board sought the advice of the Attorney General as to the potential options in relation to the Board&rsquo;s files when the Board would cease to exist. The Attorney General also consulted with my Department before giving its advices to the Board.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Board that files for the period in question were not destroyed where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board were aware of or party to legal proceedings. It may well be that civil actions are being taken against the State by persons who previously made complaints to the Board where the Board is not a party to such proceedings.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board is an independent body and discharges its statutory responsibilities in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986.  It is the Board&rsquo;s policy not to comment on individual cases.  I note that the person referred to by the Deputy is currently undertaking civil proceedings against the State.  In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his views, in cases in which non-nationals have come before the courts for repeated offences, on whether it is appropriate that sentencing should include deportation. </Quest>
        <QRef>[13952/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that Section 3(2)(b) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, provides for the making of a Deportation Order in respect of a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court in the State before which such person was indicted for or charged with any crime or offence.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no provision in Irish law for the automatic deportation or judicially ordered deportation of a non-national who has committed a criminal offence.  However, it has long been the practice of Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give consideration to deportation in particular cases where a non-national has been convicted of a serious offence.</P>
        <P>Deportations in these situations are usually complex.  Any person to be deported must first be served with a written notice of intention to deport, as provided for under Section 3 of the <Col N="621"/>Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) which advises each individual of the options open to them at that point in time, namely (a) to consent to deportation, (b) to agree to return voluntarily to their country of origin or (c) to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out reasons why they should not be deported.  Where option (c) is availed of, any written representations submitted by or on behalf of the person in question is considered before a final decision is taken as to whether that person should be the subject of a Deportation Order.  In view of the separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Executive, I am not in a position to comment on repeat offenders and whether or not their sentences should include a recommendation by a judge to deport.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  One such condition is that the applicant must be of good character.</P>
        <P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person in question was received in the Citizenship section of my Department on 14 November 2005.  As the person concerned had come to the adverse attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I decided to refuse the application.  In making my decision I have exercised my absolute discretion as provided by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. There is no appeals process under this Act.  Should the individual in question feel that the information provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is incorrect, she should submit details in writing to my Department and officials in the Citizenship Section will investigate further.</P>

If an application for asylum has been made by the first named person the Deputy will of course be aware that it is not the practice to comment on asylum applications that are pending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second named person applied for asylum on 14 September, 2006.  Included in her application was one of her children, the third named person.  The second named person made a separate application for asylum on behalf of another one of her children, the fourth named person, on the 9 February 2007.  The second, third and fourth named persons&rsquo; applications were all refused and Deportation Orders were made in respect of all of them on 27 January, 2009.   The applicants sought an injunction prohibiting their deportation on the 25 February 2009.  The injunction application was made ex-parte and was granted on the 25 February 2009.</P>
        <P>The second named person instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 26 February 2009 challenging the Deportation Order made in respect of her on 27 January 2009.  The proceedings also sought that she should be allowed remain in the State pending a determination of asylum claims made in respect of two further children.  Following a full hearing of the facts of this case in the High Court on 26 March 2009, Justice Harding Clarke refused all reliefs sought.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The person referred to by the Deputy applied for asylum on 03/07/2008.  The claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation was communicated to him by letter dated 28/07/2008.  This communication advised the person of his entitlement to appeal the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did.  The <Col N="623"/>Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the person&rsquo;s appeal, following which the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner&rsquo;s earlier recommendation to reject his claim.  The outcome of the appeal was made known to the applicant by letter dated 12 March 2009.</P>
        <P>In accordance with normal procedures, the applicant&rsquo;s file will be forwarded to my Department&rsquo;s Ministerial Decisions Unit for final processing of the asylum claim.  A letter will issue to him from my Department advising him formally that his asylum claim has been rejected and affording him three options as follows:</P>
<P el="5">1. Return home voluntarily</P>

	<P>The first person concerned arrived in the State on 11 June 2002 and applied for asylum on 28 June 2002.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 13 June 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported. </P>
        <P>Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative.  On 10 September 2003, my predecessor signed a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned. Notice of this Order was served by registered letter dated 30 October 2003 requiring the person concerned to present herself at Ennis Garda Station, Ennis, County Clare on Thursday 6 November 2003 in order to make arrangements for her removal from the State.  The person concerned initially presented as required and was given three further presentation dates which she kept.  She last presented on 13 January 2004.  She has not presented since that date <Col N="625"/>and is now classified as evading her deportation.  Should she come to the notice of the Garda&iacute;, she would be liable to arrest and detention.  She should, therefore, present herself to the GNIB without any further delay.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and for leave to remain temporarily in the State were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P>The second person concerned arrived in the State on 21 October 2001 and applied for asylum on 22 October 2001.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 30 October 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.</P>
        <P>Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative.  On 10 September 2003, my predecessor signed a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned.  Notice of this Order was served by registered letter dated 30 October 2003 requiring the person concerned to present herself at Ennis Garda Station, Ennis, County Clare on Thursday 6 November 2003 in order to make arrangements for her removal from the State.  The person concerned initially presented as required and was given three further presentation dates which she kept.  She last presented on 13 January 2004.  She has not presented since that date and is now classified as evading her deportation. Should she come to the notice of the Garda&iacute;, she would be liable to arrest and detention.  She should, therefore, present herself to the GNIB without any further delay.</P>
        <P>By correspondence dated 16 January 2007, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by her legal representative.  Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused.  The legal representative of the person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 5 February 2007. I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and for leave to remain temporarily in the State were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.</P>
        <P>The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  If an application for asylum has been made by the third person concerned, the Deputy will of course be aware that it is not the practice to comment on asylum applications that are pending.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 9 November 2005.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 12 May 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received from the person concerned. </P>
        <P>The person concerned has also submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received <Col N="627"/>in the Citizenship Division of my Department in June 2007.  Applications for naturalisation are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  Additional resources were allocated to the Citizenship Division to enable certain categories of applicant to be dealt with more expeditiously.  These include refugees, spouses of Irish citizens and minors.</P>
        <P>The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.  Officials in that Division inform me that the application is at an advanced stage of processing and the file will be submitted to my Office for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 1016 of Wednesday, 24 September, 2008 and the written Reply to that Question.  The person concerned applied for asylum on 18 December 2001. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 8 January 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and these representations will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might wish to note that the person concerned also made an application for permission to remain in the State in accordance with the revised arrangements applicable to the non-EEA national parents of Irish born children, born in the State before 1 January 2005.  The revised arrangements in question, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 Scheme, were announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 15 January 2005 and the Closing Date for receipt of applications was 31 March 2005.  The application of the person concerned was received on 13 February 2006 and, as such, was received much too late for consideration.  The person concerned was made aware of the non-acceptance of his IBC/05 application by letter dated 16 February 2006.</P>

In the prison setting  physical education affords prisoners the opportunity to take control of one aspect of their daily life, their physical well-being, with the potential  knock-on effect of increasing their motivation and confidence to tackle other identified issues such as substance abuse, taking up educational or workshop opportunities.  It is also recognised that physical education, sport and recreation also play a significant role in the management of prison life by providing positive outlets for energy.</P>

	<P>The average processing time from application to decision for the generality of valid applications for certificates of naturalisation is now at 23 months.  It is expected that this will progressively improve over the coming year to an average timeframe of 18 months, which I regard as a reasonable target.  The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007.  The Immigration Division of my Department inform me that the current processing time for an application for long-term residency is approximately 21 months.</P>

	<P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his previous Parliamentary Question in this matter, No. 553 of Tuesday 1 July 2008.  Applications for Leave to Remain in the State are founded on the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).  Under these provisions, persons who have no legal basis for being in the State are afforded, among other options, the option to submit, within a period of 15 working days, written representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out the reasons why they should be permitted to remain temporarily in the State.  The majority of persons in this position avail of this option and submit, <Col N="632"/>or have submitted on their behalf, written representations in support of an application for leave to remain in the State.</P>
        <P>All such applications have to be considered on their individual merits under the eleven separate headings set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended).  The Deputy might note that each case is considered individually and regardless of whether or not written representations are submitted by, or on behalf of, the applicant.  Following a detailed examination of each individual case, a recommendation is made as to whether a Deportation Order should be issued or temporary Leave to Remain in the State granted.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to provide a precise indication of the number of such cases which are awaiting a decision at present.  However, a detailed assessment is in progress and when this exercise has been completed I will advise the Deputy of the up to date figure.  The consideration of applications for leave to remain in the State is a resource intensive process.  It is not, however, possible to provide an average processing time in the context of such applications, primarily because no two applications will be the same in terms of their complexity.</P>

The implementation of the scheme for the Civil Scheme is being dealt with by the Department of Finance and this has given rise to a number of issues, particularly in relation to procurement, warranty and insurance.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation in Zimbabwe remains fragile following the formation of a power-sharing government involving Zanu-PF and the MDC in February.  There have been some small signs of progress, and I hope that the new <Col N="633"/>Government will be able to address the significant problems now facing Zimbabwe.  The release of Roy Bennett, the designated MDC deputy agriculture minister, sent a positive signal, although he has not yet been sworn in to his Ministerial post.</P>
        <P>However, the continued detention of other political and human rights activists remains a cause of concern, and many of those who have been released still have charges pending against them.  It is also difficult to see how the Zimbabwean economy can be stabilised and reformed as long as Gideon Gono remains in place as Reserve Bank Governor.  The power-sharing government needs to deliver real progress, including in securing political freedoms, a return to the rule of law and economic development for the people of Zimbabwe.  Millions still depend on food aid, and will continue to do so until there is a successful harvest.  The continuation of land seizures is not helpful in this context. Ireland will carefully monitor developments in this area.</P>
        <P>Despite doubts about the efficacy of a power-sharing administration which continues to include Mr. Mugabe, my EU colleagues and I have repeatedly stated our willingness to re-engage with a Zimbabwean government which restores political freedom and returns to responsible macroeconomic management.  Ireland was among the donors which met to discuss Zimbabwe in Washington on 20 March, where we agreed to work with the transitional government to achieve specific goals identified in the power-sharing agreement, notably the restoration of the rule of law, economic stabilization, commitment to democracy, respect for human rights, and full access to humanitarian assistance.</P>
        <P>The international community will calibrate our re-engagement with Zimbabwe on the basis of concrete achievements in all of these areas. We believe that if the political will exists, the transitional government will be able to demonstrate its commitment to reform very quickly.  I have noted that at its Summit on 30 March, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) called on the EU to lift its restrictive measures against those linked to the Mugabe regime.  However, we have not yet seen sufficient tangible signs of change to warrant reversing this policy.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made its views on the situation abundantly clear to the Zimbabwean authorities, and to our partners in the region.  We will continue to raise our concerns as appropriate in bilateral contacts with southern African partners.  In 2008, Irish Aid provided over &euro;10.5 million in funding for Zimbabwe, channelled through non-governmental organisations and UN agencies.  I sincerely hope that the new power-sharing government will bring economic stability and political freedom to Zimbabwe.  Ireland will continue to make every effort to ensure that the issue of Zimbabwe remains a priority for the EU.</P>

	<P>The enterprise stream of the back to work allowance (BTWA) scheme is designed to assist people, who are long term dependant on social welfare payments, to take up self-employment.  Participants receive a tapered percentage of their social welfare payment over a four year period for those who become self employed and they may also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits.</P>
        <P>A person in receipt of a social welfare payment who decides to set up as a self employed taxi operator may be eligible to apply for the back to work enterprise allowance.  In order to <Col N="637"/>qualify, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a certain duration, which is two years in the case of a person on a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  Those taking up self-employment must first have their self-employment project approved as viable and sustainable.</P>
        <P>In partnership areas, this will be done by the partnership company.  In non-partnership areas, this will be done by the Department&rsquo;s local facilitator.  Approval normally involves an interview with the applicant to assess the viability of the proposed project and to provide advice on funding or on &ldquo;Start Your Own Business&rdquo; courses and other relevant aspects.  Each application for the back to work enterprise allowance is decided within the criteria set down for the scheme.  A breakdown by occupation or the nature of the self-employment of recipients of the back to work enterprise allowance scheme is not available from records held by the Department.</P>

	<P>Spouses of self-employed contributors, who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, can apply to the Department to have the commercial partnership formally recognised, and to be treated as an individual self-employed contributor.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay Class S self-employed PRSI, which can count towards qualification for State Pension (Contributory) and other Social Welfare benefits.  An information leaflet &lsquo;Working with Your Spouse&rsquo; was published in June 2008.</P>
        <P>Of the 713 applications to have a commercial partnership retrospectively recognised, received by the Department, 633 are in respect of farm partnerships.  To-date 202 applicants have been issued with decisions; some 80% have been granted and 20% disallowed.  No statistical information is maintained on State Pension (Contributory) applications arising from retrospectively recognised commercial partnerships.  Such pension applications are dealt with as part of the normal claim load.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Social Welfare legislation provides for the payment of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in respect of days of unemployment.  Any day on which a person either receives or has an entitlement to holiday pay is not regarded as a day of unemployment and a person has no entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in respect of that day.  Employees who are laid off temporarily (i.e. where they expect to return to the same employment at a later date) are not entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in respect of any day for which there is an entitlement to holiday pay.  This applies even if there is no definite date of resumption of work.</P>
        <P>The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, provides for the holiday pay entitlements of part-time Employees.  In accordance with this act and as a result of agreement with relevant parties since 2003 certain school employees are entitled to a percentage pay increase in respect of holiday entitlement.  Where there are unemployment claims from such employees, details of holiday pay entitlements must be forwarded by the Employer to the relevant Social Welfare Local Office.  The number of days holiday pay due is then determined <Col N="638"/>by dividing the total numbers of hours paid in respect of holiday pay by the average number of hours worked per day.</P>
        <P>In the case of the person concerned she had been paid the equivalent of 8 days employment and consequently was not entitled to payment of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from the start of her claim on 23 December 2008 until return to employment on 7 January 2009.  She has appealed this decision.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the CSO figures on regional income and unemployment rates.  This Department&rsquo;s role is to mainly to provide income support to people who qualify for social welfare payments.  The value of the lowest rate of welfare payment was fully maintained in Budget 2009 and now stands at &euro;204.30 per week following an increase of &euro;6.50 per week or over 3%.  In the last six Budgets, the value of the lowest rate of payment has increased by a cumulative &euro;79.50 per week or 64%.  By any standards, the levels of increases in welfare payments generally over the period since 2003 have been substantial and are a demonstration of our continuing commitment to all those who are less well off.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides a range of supports to assist unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, lone parents, and sickness related welfare recipients, to return to the active labour market either by taking up employment or becoming self-employed.  The main welfare to work measure for the unemployed is the National Employment Action Plan (EAP).  Under the EAP, people who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department and referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to job placement or an offer of training.</P>
        <P>Other supports include the operation of the back to education and back to work allowance schemes, the technical assistance and training grants and the PRSI exemption scheme.  The activation and family services programme and the second chance education opportunities <Col N="639"/>scheme also offer supports to social welfare recipients and disadvantaged persons to assist them to improve their employability and personal and family situations.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s facilitator network works with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that individuals have and ultimately improve their employment chances as well as help them continue to develop personally.  Facilitators are working closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies at national and local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development opportunities.  The facilitator programme is designed to be a targeted approach, involving active case management and the development of an individualised progression plan.  Twenty additional facilitators have recently been appointed under the Social and Economic Participation Programme provided for under the National Development Plan 2007-13.  This brings the total in place to 60.</P>
        <P>As part of the programme, three additional facilitator posts have been allocated to the south east region, bringing the total number of posts in that region to nine.  These officers, located in counties Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Kildare and Wicklow, work directly with those on Social Welfare in order to determine their needs.  They arrange, through direct provision or jointly with other agencies, appropriate training and developmental programmes to equip them to progress to employment, enhance their parenting skills or improve their life opportunities.  The enhanced facilitation service will build on the Department&rsquo;s existing experience and income maintenance relationship with the people concerned, in co-operation with other relevant service providers such as F&Aacute;S, VECs, HSE and other local agencies.</P>

	<P>The person concerned submitted an application for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance on 12 February 2008.  One of the conditions for receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance is that the person must be habitually resident in this State.  The person concerned was found not to be habitually resident in the State at that time and, accordingly, her application was disallowed and she was notified of this decision on 8 May 2008.</P>
        <P>She appealed this decision and the Appeals Officer decided that she was not habitually resident in the State for social welfare purposes and disallowed the appeal.  The reasons for the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision were that she had lived most of her life outside the State, she did not have an established pattern of employment within the State, her husband&rsquo;s status within the State remained uncertain and the Appeals Officer did not consider that she had significant durable ties with Ireland to suggest her centre of interest was within the State.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>In January 2007, my predecessor, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, placed a Preservation Order under the National Monuments Act, 1930, (as amended) on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street because of the historical significance of No. 16&rsquo;s association with the 1916 Rising.  The other properties were included in the Preservation Order to protect No. 16.  All are part of the former Carlton Cinema site in respect of which re-development proposals are currently before An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la for determination.</P>
        <P>I am aware of some concerns regarding this aspect of the proposed redevelopment.  However, any works affecting a national monument, including any excavation or ground disturbance within, around or in proximity to it, require the prior written consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the National Monuments Acts.  In considering such an application the Minister is statutorily obliged to consult with the Director of the National Museum of Ireland.  Any proposed works affecting No. 16 will be subject to this procedure.</P>

Following an evaluation of the proposal against the criteria set out in the circular i.e. the age and condition of the dwellings, the unit cost of refurbishment, etc. it was determined that the project was not suitable for inclusion in the three-year remedial works programme as it proposed the demolition and rebuilding of the units rather than their remediation.  My Department informed the Borough Council of this determination on 7 February 2009.  Although this project does not meet the criteria of a remedial works project, the Council may, in the future, wish to consider the project in the context of its general social housing construction and acquisition programme.  </P>

	<P>Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.   Broadband services are available from competing service providers over multiple platforms, including DSL (telephone lines), cable, fixed wireless, mobile and satellite.  Details of the availability of broadband services in specific areas are available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises the importance of ubiquitous access to broadband and its widespread provision continues to be a priority.  Government policy has been to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector providers.  Where market failure has occurred the Government has undertaken a variety of initiatives to improve broadband coverage, including the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS), in the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme and more recently the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).</P>
        <P>Under the NBS contract, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, will provide affordable, scaleable broadband services to rural areas.  The NBS will be rolled out on an Electoral Divisions (ED) basis and the EDs to be addressed in County Kildare are set out in the table below.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.  3 is currently planning the construction and rollout of the required infrastructure for the purposes of the provision of the service.  Challenging rollout targets have been agreed with 3.  Services will begin to be rolled out in April 2009 and the entire NBS area must be covered by September 2010.</P><Col N="646"/>

	<P>This Government is committed to the maintenance of an active and substantial forestry programme, evidenced by the almost &euro;125 million that has been allocated to the forestry subhead for 2009.  The current suite of Afforestation Grant and Premium Schemes is the most financially attractive package made available in the history of forestry in Ireland.  The establishment grant covers 100% of the planting costs, while the annual forestry premium is payable to farmers for 20 years. Under the Forest Environment Protection Scheme (FEPS), landowners can receive a premium of up to &euro;200 per hectare, over and above their forestry premium, should they choose to participate in the scheme, which promotes the establishment of high nature value forestry. </P>
        <P>The Forest Service of my Department remains dedicated to the task of promoting and supporting a robust afforestation programme.  It is fully aware of the need to maximize the carbon sequestration potential of Irish forests, and fully recognises the economic and environmental potential of forests in the areas of employment provision, as an energy resource and in biodiversity.</P>

	<P>New rules restricting fishing vessels&rsquo; days at sea in the Irish Sea and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland have been introduced as part of the EU&rsquo;s revised Cod Recovery Plan.  The plan has introduced a new system of effort management that sets effort ceilings (expressed in kilowatt-days) for groups of vessels or fleet segments.  The management of these ceilings has been devolved to the national level.</P>
        <P>Member States have received annual allocations of fishing effort for the areas covered by the Plan, which include the Irish Sea (ICES area VIIa) and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland (ICES area VIa).  The effort allocation levels were established by the EU Fisheries Council on the basis of an EU Commission proposal.  They were calculated by averaging the fishing activity levels of each Member State in the areas during a reference period of 2004-2006 or 2005-2007 and then reducing that effort by 25%.  This methodology means there is now limited fishing effort available for all Community vessels, including Irish vessels, fishing in the designated areas.</P>
        <P>Under the plan, each Member State is required to introduce a licensing regime to manage its effort allocations.  Any vessel longer than 10 metres overall must have an authorisation from its Member State in order to operate in one of the designated areas using the fishing gears covered by the plan.  Member States can decide on the method of allocating their national pools of fishing effort, which are broken down by fishing gear type.  Following consultations with representatives of the Irish fishing industry, the Department introduced a pilot system of authorisations and allocations of fishing effort for the period from 1 February to 30 April 2009.</P>
        <P>The pilot scheme used the following approach to allocate fishing effort in areas VIa and VIIa to Irish vessels for the pilot management period of 1 February to 30 April 2009:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="ix" />The track records of vessels operating in VIa and VIIa during the reference period of 2005-2008 were assessed to determine their eligibility to receive an authorisation to fish and an allocation of days-at-sea under the pilot scheme.  Each vessel&rsquo;s &ldquo;best year&rdquo; of fishing days in the areas during the reference period was used to establish its track record.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="ix" />Distribution bands were established for each of the specified gear types to facilitate the allocation of days-at-sea to vessels based on their track records with those gears.  Each vessel&rsquo;s level of track record with a gear type fit into one of the distribution bands for that gear type.  The vessel then was allocated the number days-at-sea for that gear which were associated with that distribution band.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5"><Miles com="ix" />The days-at-sea allocations for the first management period (1 February to 30 April 2009) were given on a pro-rata basis for each gear type based on Irish vessels&rsquo; traditional fishing pattern with the gears in the area during that those months (e.g., if the months were traditionally very busy for a gear type, a higher portion of days-at-sea were allocated for that gear).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Initially, vessels with less than 10 days of track record in their best years during the reference period received no allocation of fishing effort. Following further consultations and following on recommendations from industry Minister Killeen decided on the 18th of February this year to adopt the following approach in respect of those vessels for the remainder of the Pilot period.</P>
        <P>Vessels with track records of less than 10 days but more than five days to be given an allocation of three days at sea for the current management period.  Vessels with track records <Col N="651"/>of five days or less but at least one day to be given an allocation of one day at sea for the current management period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am advised that the vessel referred to by the Deputy had 2 days of track record in 2008 and no track record in respect of any of the other reference period years. Consequently, the allocation for this vessel was determined on the basis of the second category above in that he was given an allocation of one day for the current management period. The authorisation in this case was issued on the 20th of February, 2009.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the introduction of these new conservation measures are a challenge and I have established a Steering Group involving the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF), the Irish Fisherman&rsquo;s Organisation (IFO), the Department and agencies to provide support to the industry in relation to the practical implementation of these new measures.  The effort allocations already made were done on a pilot basis only and I am happy to make amendments where proposed by the Steering Group within the legal framework that has been established.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 to 223, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There is no question of a dispute between the Russian Government and my Department in relation to compensation for stock recalled after the discovery of dioxins in pork products sent to the Russian Federation.  Officials from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia are in ongoing contact with the Russian authorities on the subject of the recall of such products.  Their efforts have been greatly assisted by the 7th Session of the Russian Federation &ndash; Ireland Joint Commission, which was held in Dublin in early March.  The Irish delegation was headed by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mary Coughlan, TD and the Russian delegation was headed by Deputy Prime Minister Mr. Dmitry Kozak.  Discussions at this Commission proved very fruitful and positive.</P>
        <P>In relation to the possible supply to Russia of pork and pork products containing dioxin, from Ireland, during the period of 1 September to 11 December 2008, the Irish side agreed to undertake to resolve the issue of the return and disposal of such products in the territory of the Russian Federation, at the exporter&rsquo;s or the Irish Government&rsquo;s expense.  The Irish side also agreed to submit detailed information in relation to aspects of the dioxin contamination incident.</P>
        <P>As regards stock affected by the recall in overseas destinations, including Russia, my Department has always made it clear that where such product meets the terms of the Pigmeat Recall Scheme, it may be included in any claim for ex gratia compensation submitted by the processor concerned.  The product may be either returned to Ireland for rendering here or disposed of overseas, in accordance with the procedures laid down by the competent authorities there.  In either case, the cost of disposal of eligible product is being met from Scheme funds.   In relation to pigmeat product in St. Petersburg, agreement has been reached with the Russians to return product which is in whole consignments, to Ireland for destruction.  Product which is not in whole consignments, or which is being stored in other provinces, is to be destroyed in Russia, <Col N="653"/>under the supervision of the Russian authorities, subject to final agreement on a form for the disposal of such product.</P>
        <P>My Department has already made three separate tranches of payments to Irish processors affected by the scheme, totalling &euro;45m.  These payments have been made on an interim basis, based on a percentage of the declared value of product stored both here and overseas.  The criteria for payment included an ability to verify to my Department&rsquo;s satisfaction the presence, volume and category of product abroad. This did not prove possible for certain stock still in Russia and claims for payment could not be sustained. However, this was not directly connected with our discussions with the Russian authorities.  Provided the criteria laid down by my Department can be met, all applications for payment are being considered.</P>

        <Quest> the reason there was a special room prepared at a school (details supplied) in County Mayo; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The question of refurbishing the room in the school referred to by the Deputy arose from High Court proceedings in 2006 relating to suitable education provision for the child in question. An independent expert&rsquo;s report identified the school as the most suitable location for this child. The school were willing to accept the child but required works to be carried out to the school building to facilitate the enrolment. </P>
        <P>In view of the urgency of the case, a senior architect from my Department visited the school on 19th October 2006 and recommended that works be carried out to the school building to facilitate this child, refurbish some other areas of the building and address some health and safety issues. A letter of approval issued to the school in October 2006 for the works in question. Consultants were appointed to oversee the project and a builder contracted to carry out the work in question. The works were completed in April 2007.  As it transpired the pupil did not attend the school.  Parents are not obliged to send their child to a particular school.  I understand that the works that were carried out have been of benefit to other children in the school and to the school generally and may assist future enrolments.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest> if he will ensure that the branch of an association (details supplied) in Letterkenny, County Donegal, will be included in his financial allocation in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware a key focus and priority of my Department is to provide for resources in schools to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia. For mainstream primary schools, this is done through the General Allocation Model.  This model was introduced in September 2005 and ensures that mainstream primary schools have the additional teaching resources already in place to enable them cater for children with high-incidence special educational needs, including dyslexia.  </P>
        <P>It is a matter for the individual school to use its professional judgement to identify pupils that will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils. My Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05, to schools to provide guidelines and advice on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.  In addition, my Department provides funding for a number of special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools which have been sanctioned to meet the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation  grant.</P>
        <P>Second level pupils with dyslexia are normally included in mainstream classes.  Additional teacher supports are allocated to second level schools and Vocational Education Committees to cater for pupils with special educational needs, including, where appropriate, pupils with dyslexia.  In accordance with the terms of circular letter M10/94 and depending on an educational assessment, pupils with dyslexia may meet the criteria for exemption from the learning of the Irish Language on the grounds of having a learning disability. They may also be eligible for special arrangements in State Certificate Examinations.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education once relevant professionals recommend the equipment. Schools <Col N="655"/>can apply to the local special educational needs organiser (SENO) directly for this support. My Department supports teachers with additional training needs in the area of dyslexia.  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) manages, co-ordinates and develops a range of supports in response to identified teacher training needs. The SESS provides fees&rsquo; subsidies for the on-line training course, &ldquo;Dyslexia: Identification and Early Interventions&rdquo;. Fees&rsquo; subsidies are also provided for teachers to enable them to avail of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland courses.</P>
        <P>My Department has developed an information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom,DVD and video format, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. This product has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools. The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom. I know that the Dyslexia Association supported and assisted in this initiative.</P>
        <P>The Dyslexia Association of Ireland has provided a range of supports for children with dyslexia and their parents over the years. The Dyslexia Association has also cooperated with various initiatives taken by my Department, including the Task Force on Dyslexia.  While my Department has provided funding to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland at national level, it is not in a position to make additional funding available to local branches of the Association.</P>

        <Quest> the situation regarding maintenance payments for the students studying at PhD level in the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Third Level Student Support Schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration (pursued in a university or a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds) in other EU Member States with effect from the 1996/97 academic year. The extension of the Schemes at that time did not include courses at  postgraduate level and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available under the schemes for students pursuing postgraduate studies outside of Ireland.  Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside of Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.</P>
        <P>At present, there are no plans to expand the provisions in the grant schemes in relation to postgraduate study abroad.  However, Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000, as amended by Section 29 of the Finance Act 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate tuition fees paid in colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000/01 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from an individual&rsquo;s Local Tax Office.</P>

	<P>Tax relief was provided in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 where an employer provides a bicycle for an employee. The implementation of the scheme for the Civil Service is being dealt with by the Department of Finance. I understand that implementing the scheme in the Civil Service has given rise to a number of issues, particularly in relation to procurement, warranty and insurance.  The Department of Finance has, I understand, raised these issues with the State Claims Agency, Chief State Solicitors Office and the Office of the Attorney General.  Once these issues have been clarified, the Department of Finance will issue a circular providing for a scheme in the Civil Service and this scheme can provide a framework for a similar scheme in the wider Public Service.</P>
