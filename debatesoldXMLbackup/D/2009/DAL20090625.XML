	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat to our economic stability posed by continued Government ineptitude as highlighted by the latest report of the International Monetary Fund, which claims that the Irish economy is the most overheated of all advanced economies with the collapse of tax revenue potentially pushing the deficit to 12% of national income and Irish banks facing losses of &euro;35 billion by next year. </P>

	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 25, Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 &mdash; Report and Final Stages (resumed); No. <i>a</i>1, Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008 &mdash; amendments from the Seanad; No. 26, Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 <i>[Seanad]</i> &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted on the conclusion of Question Time; the proceedings on the resumed Report and Final Stages of No. 25 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the proceedings on No. <i>a</i>1 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 60 minutes and any amendments from the Seanad not disposed of shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Seanad amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Health and Children; the Report and Final Stages of No. 26 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 6.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Question Time today shall be taken on the conclusion of No. 26 for 75 minutes and in the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken after 45 minutes; and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are five proposals to be put to the House.  Is the proposal that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. today agreed to? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I challenge this move to adjourn.  Yesterday, a vital report was produced by the IMF which requires urgent consideration by the House before it adjourns for the summer.  People did not need to be told that the pain they are now enduring is entirely due to domestic policy failures on the part of this Government.  The report singles out, in particular, the 2008 budget introduced by the current Taoiseach.  People already knew that.  What is really worrying about the IMF report is the very significant number of pitfalls it identifies in the Government&rsquo;s strategy relating to banking.  The notion that this House would rise without having examined these in great detail is a serious affront to its role.</P>
        <P>The IMF has reported that the deficit in the banks by 2010 will be &euro;35 billion.  That will be more than the aggregate of their capital reserves and retained earnings.  The report also takes considerable issue with elements of the strategy regarding NAMA.  A prominent economist has said there are those who do not know and those who do not know that they do not know. <Col N="3"/> People who do not know something look for advice, but what do people who do not know that they do not know do?  They push ahead and brook no opposition.  They have no debate, do not evaluate the options and proceed without an opportunity for proper scrutiny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It cannot be debated now. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The trouble is that the Government is falling into that position. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Bruton has made his point.  He has been given a great deal of latitude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to realise that the IMF has indicated there are serious pitfalls with several critical elements of legislation that is due to be brought before the House in September.  These relate to how the pricing will be dealt with, whether banks that are below the water line should be nationalised, whether non-development loans should be included, whether good development loans should be excluded&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and whether there should be a bank resolution scheme.  There are pitfalls across the board that could pose significant risks for the taxpayer.  It is our obligation to scrutinise the proposals before an interim board makes substantial commitments on behalf of the Irish people that we have not examined. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A proposal by the Minister on how items are to be dealt with is a technical proposal of very narrow scope, and the merits and demerits of the item do not arise at this stage.  I will allow brief statements, not long statements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we can agree any business today we must hear from the Government when the House will have an opportunity to debate the two reports that were published yesterday, by the IMF and the OECD, respectively.  Both are extremely critical of the Government and are at variance with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not.  The Deputy should read the reports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot imagine a Minister for Finance in any other country who, having received such a damning report on the economic and financial performance of a Government of which he has been part for the past 12 years, would say he welcomed it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the laughing stock of Europe. </P>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>Right, James.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that it had nothing to do with him, that he really was not part of of the Government at all, that he was some kind of distant supporter of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Jackie Healy Rae.  A distant supporter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This report on the economy is very serious.  It is quite at variance with the Government&rsquo;s take on the economy.  Only a month ago, admittedly before the elections, the Taoiseach told a meeting in Slane in County Meath that the economy would return to rapid growth as early as 2010.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>The green shoots.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government still believe the economy will return to rapid growth in 2010?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate that now, Deputy Gilmore. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>These are issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not have statements about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my point.  I appreciate that I will not have the opportunity of ventilating these matters to the extent to which they should be ventilated in this session today.  That is why I am looking for a debate, why I ask the Government what type of arrangements it will allow for us to debate and discuss these issues.  The take adopted by the IMF and the OECD on the state of our economy is quite different from the stated take of the Government.  We must assess that.</P>
        <P>Second, their assessment of what the Government is doing in respect of the banking system is at variance with what the Government proposes to do, which is still vague.  We still do not know when this legislation will be published and considered by the House.  Meanwhile, events continue apace.  Before we go into recess for the summer we need to have a proper and serious debate about the state of the economy based on these two reports.  I will not agree anything on today&rsquo;s Order of Business until I receive a commitment from the Minister for Finance that the House will have such a debate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be no surprise that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, saw no problem whatsoever with the reports because the interpretation he quite rightly might put on them is that they exonerate him in his current role as Minister and lay the blame firmly and squarely on the former Minister for Finance, the current Taoiseach.  What a wonderful way to start the day, particularly when sitting in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s chair.  He might fancy that prospect for the future.</P>
        <P>The fact is there was collective responsibility.  The current Minister for Finance cannot wash his hands of responsibility as he tried to do this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have this now. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>He made a stoic effort to do so but failed because the truth is there is collegiality and collective responsibility.  The IMF report is damning on the stewardship of this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, you must keep to the proposal before the House as must others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;going back to 1997 when this Government, under Fianna F&aacute;il, came into office. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You have made your point now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact.  I join with other colleagues in requesting confirmation that we will have the opportunity to address properly the content of the IMF and <Col N="5"/>OECD reports and that both will be accommodated.  It should be happening today but is not on the Order Paper.  What we need is confirmation that we will have a thorough opportunity in the coming week to address both reports and that this Government will step up to the mark in terms of its responsibility for the plight it has imposed on the lives of ordinary citizens up, down and across the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A debate on this subject is a matter for the Whips.  Clearly, Members of the Opposition have to read the report before we can have a debate on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies do not like it when it is pointed out to them.  The two priority areas referred to are the banking systems and fiscal policy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;states the Government has moved with resolve to counter the severe economic and fiscal shocks.  The IMF supports the establishment of NAMA.  In paragraph 21 it describes NAMA&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Read paragraph 25.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as pivotal to the orderly restructuring of the financial sector and the limiting of long-term damage to the economy.  According to paragraph 45, which Deputy Burton wishes me to read out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Paragraph 25.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;NAMA offers the prospect of extracting the stressed assets from the banks, a pre-condition for their return to healthy functionality. </P>
        <P>The IMF also agrees that NAMA can be self-financing if it is well managed.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to guillotine the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 at 1.30 p.m. today.  Very many important amendments remain to be addressed in respect of this legislation.  We also have before us two other Bills, the proceedings on both of which it is proposed to guillotine.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  There is importance in the subject matter of each piece of legislation before the House, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill and the Housing (Miscellaneous <Col N="7"/>Provisions) Bill.  This is a scandalous approach on the part of this Government to the conduct of business in the House.  The House is literally being asked to rubber stamp whatever the Government wishes to present to this and the other Chamber.  It is not the way to do business.  Critical amendments which people have put a great deal of time and effort into preparing will not now be addressed. </P>

	<P>This Bill was considered by the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Law Reform in considerable detail.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed.  A guillotine is being imposed on health legislation again.  Yesterday, we objected to a guillotine that only allowed us one hour to discuss amendments to another health Bill.  We had not even finished dealing with the first group of amendments when the time concluded.  This is not an adequate amount of time to deal with a considerable number of Seanad amendments to important legislation.  I can envisage considerable debate on at least one amendment.  The guillotine is being used randomly on legislation.  I am unsure about whether the Government has even read the Seanad&rsquo;s amendments.  Perhaps it has, but the ten amendments are substantial and there is no way to deal with them adequately in the time allocated.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We are dealing with amendments agreed upon by the Seanad, which are constructive changes to the legislation suggested in both Houses.  The various changes are contained in the Seanad amendments, which are before the House today.

	<P>The House cannot support this.  I understand that there are approximately 170 amendments.  While the Minister may have been able to offer some justification in respect of the previous two proposals, namely, that there are issues of urgency and immediacy and that the House has had ample time to debate, the same defence cannot be offered in this case where there is a great deal of new Government and Opposition material.  The House is entitled to debate the amendments properly.  The imposition of a guillotine in this case is inappropriate.  Indeed, it is generally inappropriate and flashing guillotines everywhere is unhelpful to D&aacute;il business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What we are witnessing is quite extraordinary.  It is not just an end of term guillotine being applied to important Bills.  This guillotine will allow one minute and 20 seconds for each amendment tabled.  Our Assembly is supposed to debate and correct legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not for the Minister to say that something is urgent legislation and that the Government is fed up listening to the Opposition&rsquo;s discussion of it.  Doing that in the Chamber is our job.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>We are constitutionally required to do it.  What the Government is doing is unconstitutional, as there is no case to be made for the guillotines.  They were applied last week to issues that did not require them, which is what we told the Government, and debates collapsed because there were not sufficient speakers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>

	<P>That is right.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the function of the Executive to make law and tell the D&aacute;il to rubber stamp it in a couple of minutes.  The Government is allowing one minute and 20 seconds per amendment.  This is simply not acceptable.  The Government has been doing it and will do it again next week by ordering all Stages of a number of Bills to be taken in just a few minutes.  Seven guillotines will be applied to legislation, not just debates.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, there was a full week in which legislation was not mentioned because the Government had no legislation ready.  It was the Government&rsquo;s fault, not this Assembly&rsquo;s.  It is <Col N="9"/>the Executive&rsquo;s job to introduce legislation.  We debated matters like motherhood and apple pie, more or less.</P>

It was only one week ago that the D&aacute;il was unable to perform its duties properly when the Government failed to provide the necessary business to fill the day&rsquo;s work and the D&aacute;il was suspended for over three hours.</P>

	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with Question Time today agreed? Agrred. I call Deputy Bruton on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise three matters.  We have all noted there are social partnership discussions about a job subsidy.  Will this require legislation?  If so, is it intended to introduce it before the House rises for the summer?</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated this morning on a radio programme that the Government had approved the heads of the National Asset Management Agency legislation.  Will he use the procedure available to him to present the heads of the Bill to the Oireachtas for consideration so it can have an early opportunity to have an input?</P>
        <P>With regard to the reform of the regulatory structure of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator, the Minister indicated responsibility for consumer information would be transferred elsewhere.  What will happen regarding consumer protection under the new structure and when will we see the legislation?  It is feared that consumers will be squeezed as the Central Bank regains total control over regulation.  The consumer protection element, which is needed, now seems to be downgraded to simply an information role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the jobs protection initiative, regarding which the Government is in discussion with the social partners, no legislation is required at this stage.</P>
        <P>The position on NAMA is that work has commenced on the preparation of the legislation.  I am glad the Deputy asked about the heads of the Bill.  The heads are approved by the Government but not the crucial head on valuation because we are still receiving technical <Col N="12"/>advice on the valuation procedures.  When the heads are finalised by the Government, I will consider the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion.  It is my intention to publish the legislation later in July.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On the question on the regulatory structure, legislation will be required to give effect to the various proposals involved.  The reason the Government took a decision at this stage was to expedite the recruitment process for a head of financial regulation.  Clearly, a job description is required for this role and in this regard the Government has engaged Sir Andrew Large, a former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, to assist in the recruitment of a new independent regulator of the banking system.  It was essential to have a Government decision on the legislative framework.  It is not the intention to devalue the consumer function of the new Central Bank of Ireland commission.  However, half the staff of the regulatory office were involved over the years on consumer work and this was a distraction from the essential banking stability and supervision work that any regulator must do.</P>

	<P>When will we see that legislation? </P>

	<P>It will be later in the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three matters I wish to raise.  In response to my earlier question on the need for a debate in the House on the IMF and OECD reports, the Minister said he would leave it to the Whips to arrange.  Can I take it from this reply that the Government is, therefore, agreeing there will be a debate on those reports in the House prior to the summer recess and that it is now left to the Whips to arrange the time therefore?</P>
        <P>A year ago today the Government published the heads of a proposed Bill on civil partnerships.  We have not seen any progress since.  When will it be finalised and published?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, indicated publicly there will be a climate change Bill introduced by the Government prior to Christmas.  However, when Deputy McManus and I asked the Taoiseach about it this week, he did not seem to know anything about it.  He told us no proposal for such a Bill had been brought to the Government.  Will the Government introduce a climate change Bill?  If it is not in a position to do so, will it accept the Labour Party&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill, which is on the Order Paper, and consider it in Government time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the Whips to determine whether time can be allowed for a debate on the OECD and IMF reports.  It is not for me to dictate to them the position on it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>We are agreeable; it is a question of agreement on the Government&rsquo;s side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to leave the matter to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to deal with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Government that organises business.  The Minister should stop talking nonsense.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not talking nonsense but explaining the position.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarity the first matter, the Government organises the schedule of the House and orders the business that is to be taken therein.  The Whips will make arrangements on the timing of a debate but  they must do so within the context of the business ordered by the Government.  Will the Minister state whether the Government is ordering a debate on the IMF and OECD reports?  There is no point in hiding behind the Whip.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

To give fair notice, we will not co-operate with business for the rest of this session unless the Government makes a commitment that the IMF and OECD commentaries will be debated in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>It is being evaded.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said it is a matter for debate between the Whips, which it is.  I can allow specific questions on a promise made, but when a promise is not made the debt does not remain unpaid.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>We have just had one of the most damning economic reports on circumstances that will do extraordinary damage to this country.  Is the Minister for Finance so pusillanimous and afraid that he cannot even recommend that the House have a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation is straightforward.  The matter can be discussed between the Whips and it has not been excluded.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is probably the Minister&rsquo;s big break.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter has not been determined and it has not been promised and therefore it is not in order to ask about it on the Order of Business.  That is the difficulty.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can he not promise it now?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I do not want us to play word games with this. </P>

	<P>Neither do I. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>These are two very serious reports.  The economy is in a serious state.  A total of 400,000 people are out of work.  There are huge problems about which we all know.  There are two sitting weeks left for the D&aacute;il before it rises.  The Taoiseach confirmed to me yesterday that it will rise on 10 July.  We must debate the two reports that have been published as part of a serious debate on the economy.</P><Col N="15"/>
        <P>I interpreted the Minister&rsquo;s first reply, when he said that he would leave it to the Whips, benignly as meaning that there would be a debate and that the Whips would arrange the time for it.  In his second reply he is pulling back from that and saying that it is not promised but it can be arranged if the Whips can find time and so on.  I take it that he would be the Minister leading the debate on this issue.  Will we have the opportunity to debate these reports in the House?  It is not acceptable to the Labour Party that we will not have a serious debate and discussion on those major reports in the D&aacute;il.  That is what we are here to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. </P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I need a commitment from the Minister for Finance. </P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Lest our silence be taken as assent to the Government&rsquo;s approach I want to make it clear that we believe that these reports are of huge importance and do need to be debated.  We take a similar view to that of the Labour Party in respect of co-operation with business if we do not get the opportunity for reasonable debating time on these matters. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A debate has not been promised.  The Minister for Finance has stated that the Whips will discuss it.  Of course it is also open to the parties in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is urgent that the Minister with responsibility for the marine clarify the conflict which arises between those who enjoy fisheries licences and those who claim to have a licence to engage in pipe-laying.  I refer here to Broadhaven Bay.</P>
        <P>While I rarely stray from the strict matter of promised legislation, in an attempt to avoid confusion and unnecessary conflict it is important that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform clarify what will be the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when a contradiction arises between fisheries licences and other licences.

Yesterday, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food heard a prediction that as many as 140,000 jobs could be lost in the sector in the next two years.  Allied to this, we have a crisis at the farm gate in many sectors, particularly the dairy industry.

The Ceann Comhairle will recall that by virtue of the fact that the Thornton Hall development obviated the planning process, it proved necessary for the House to enact specific and peculiar legislation dealing with plans for the prison.  Given that the Minister has changed these plans by press release, legislation will be required and must be processed in the House.  Will the Minister for Finance confirm that is the case?</P>

Instead, I will deal with equally serious matters.  The Taoiseach gave an indication in the House of his intention to expedite two Bills relating to the protection of children.  One of these is to provide for the collection and exchange of information in regard to the endangerment, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse or risk thereof of children.  The second is to protect vulnerable persons against sexual exploitation.  The latter one is No. 77 and the earlier one is No. 70.  Has any progress been made on either Bill, given their urgency and the urgency the Taoiseach previously accorded to them?</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 7, line 34, after &ldquo;place&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;and may authorise interference with private property for the purpose of installing or operating such surveillance device without the consent of the owner of such property&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">As I understand it, we are not conferring powers of surveillance on the Garda.  It already has that power.  We are seeking to regulate it and make material so gathered admissible in evidence.  The purpose of the Bill is to regulate surveillance, as distinct from authorising it.  In that regard, I argued on Committee Stage that there is a lacuna in the Bill as it stands, in so far as while it regulates the act of surveillance and, to some extent, entry onto private property, it does not regulate interference with private property.  I drew attention to the fact that the UK legislation, which I have glanced at since, expressly does so.</P>
        <P>I do not know why it is not necessary for us to do it, which was the point of my intervention on the previous amendment.  The Minister said it is for the avoidance of doubt, which I anticipated he might say, and I understand that.  However, I would have thought that for the avoidance of doubt we would need to take care that the provision expressly regulates interference with property.  We caught sight of a note prepared for the Minister for Government earlier, which drew attention to the problem of malicious damage.  Notwithstanding that, we are not seeking to address it.  I tried to address this on Committee Stage.  I will not delay the House on it, but I thought for the avoidance of doubt the Minister should take it on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tabled a number of amendments.  The first in my name in this grouping is amendment No. 17, which seeks to insert three additional points which would be required for the record of approval, namely, the grounds on which the approval was granted, the less intrusive or other means considered and determined insufficient and the efforts made to secure an emergency judicial hearing.</P>
        <P>It does not take away from the intent.  It is to make sure that consideration of alternative measures was given before approval was granted.  We recognise the need for the Garda to be able to, on occasion, issue its own authorisation for surveillance in exceptional, urgent cases, but it is a major power to grant and, as such, the primary legislation underpinning it must contain safeguards.  The three additional safeguards would not overburden anybody in granting an authorisation and writing up the record.  We want to make sure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not get into the habit of issuing its own authorisations unnecessarily and that the issuing garda must go through a number of steps.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Morris and others have looked at the other areas where garda&iacute; have issuing powers of similar gravity, such as the power to extend detention and issue search warrants in urgent circumstances.  He was critical in his report of the practice of senior garda&iacute; in these <Col N="28"/>matters, and noted that they seemed to operate as little more than a rubber-stamp whenever a request was submitted by investigating officers.  As we are discussing interfering with some fundamental rights and the right to privacy, it important that senior garda&iacute; actively consider the merits of the request and whether the surveillance is truly necessary and proportionate.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 18 proposes an additional safeguard and to insert, in page 9, line 17, after the word &ldquo;hours&rdquo;, the phrase &ldquo;he or she will then produce a written record of the variation and the reasons for same&rdquo;.  It is a matter of seconds, but we would ensure that the garda in question has sat and thought about the determination before making it.  The advantages of that would then stand up in court.</P>
        <P>Regarding amendment No. 19, as it stands unless a complaint is made there is no independent oversight of this significant garda power.  As the nature of covert surveillance is secretive, in many cases a person will not know to complain, even if his or her rights are being abused by an unlawful use of this power.  For this reason, there should be some type of independent oversight of this power.  We are creating oversight with regard to many other issues and in this instance we seek to ensure that the designated judge has an oversight power.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 20 deals with tracking devices.  The Human Rights Commission believes tracking devices should not be singled out and treated differently from other forms of surveillance.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 21 refers to section 8.  Section 8(1) refers to a period of four months whereas the rest of the Bill refers to a period of three months.  The amendment seeks to standardise this because I do not see why there should be a difference in the timeframe.  Even though this section refers to tracking devices, three months is a sufficient period and the permission can be renewed thereafter if necessary, although obviously with the safeguards.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 22, it is not clear why paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are required.  I suggest we should insert paragraph (<i>a</i>) with (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>).  It is welcome that garda&iacute; requesting permission to use a tracking device have reasonable grounds for believing the device is proportionate to its objectives and used for the duration that is reasonably required.  However, she or he should also have grounds for believing that it is the least intrusive means available.  The amendment is proposed as a matter of ruling out whether there are other alternatives.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 24, in my name also, is similar to the amendment I proposed to section 7.  While I will not go back over the issue again, the amendment seeks to ensure that the powers are conditional on ensuring a proper record is kept.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 25 is self-explanatory and seeks to add an additional safeguard.  Amendment No. 26 is similar to what I have already argued in regard to amendment No. 19.  Amendment No. 27 again seeks to standardise the period of months from four to three.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, which is essential in the current climate, particularly given the events of recent days when there has been slaughter on the Malahide Road and young men in their 20s have been shot down and murdered, and there have been other gangland killings, particularly on the northside of Dublin.</P>
        <P>I strongly support amendments Nos. 13 and 19.  However, we also have a duty, as legislators, to consider the amendments very closely.  Amendment No. 13 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte states: &ldquo;and may authorise interference with private property for the purpose of installing or operating such surveillance device without the consent of the owner of such property.&rdquo;  There are serious issues at play here.  I strongly believe this type of policing must be intelligence-led policing.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is aware this is key in any strategy and knows we must have such policing if we are to tackle these <Col N="29"/>issues.  However, there are pitfalls of which we must be very careful, and issues of which we must remain conscious.</P>
        <P>It is an issue I come across in my constituency.  When people give me information about gangs, drugs or similar issues, they are very conscious when telling me the information that if there is any way it can be traced to them, their house, family or car will be burned out.  This is the reality for many parents, particularly in very disadvantaged communities.  I know many Deputies find at local clinics and during walkabouts in their constituencies that these are the kinds of issues which people whisper privately in one&rsquo;s ear, and the Deputies then pass on the information when meeting garda&iacute;.  However, ensuring our citizens are safe is the priority and must be an important part of the strategy.</P>
        <P>A recent example which concerns the surveillance issue relates to amendment No. 13 and deals specifically with private property.  We must be very careful, if private property is being used for intelligence observations of gangland figures, that those associated with that private property are not under threat themselves.  In my constituency, garda&iacute; often want to use schools as observation points for observing drug dealing.  However, if the word goes out that the school or a particular classroom is being used by garda&iacute;, that school will not last 24 hours without being burnt down.  We have a duty to ensure the safety of our citizens at all times.  I have direct experience of this.  I know particular schools that turned down Garda requests in regard to surveillance because they were worried they would not have a school there when they came in on the Monday morning.  This is a reality we must face and the people involved in justice and security issues must wake up to this situation.</P>
        <P>Intelligence-led policing is the way to tackle gangland crime but there should never be a restriction of fair trial rights, which is not a contradiction.  Trials are another way of tackling gangland crime, although this is often an issue people complain about, particularly those on the extreme right in this country.  They say that those of us who jump up and down about human rights do not care about the human rights of the victims, which is rubbish.  We are strongly in favour of the human rights of all our citizens and of having them treated on an equal basis.  In this situation, the right to life takes priority, which is why I will be supporting the legislation.  We cannot have young men in their 20s being shot down like dogs on the Malahide Road, as happened in recent days, and other incidents across the city, of which many Deputies have experience.  There are those who advocate the role of the Special Criminal Court but this would do nothing whatsoever to tackle the problem of witness intimidation.</P>
        <P>As I said, the key to the issue is good, intelligence-led policing and quality management of the Garda.  I have seen excellent examples of good practice in regard to these issues.  Where there is a good sergeant, a good drugs squad team and a good operation, much work can be done, much crime prevented and, more importantly, deaths can be prevented.  There is not enough focus on preventing the loss of life.  There is a big hurrah and reaction when somebody is shot down on a street but when it comes to trying to prevent this, not enough recognition is given to those involved, such as the garda&iacute; involved in Operation Anvil, for example, who are preventing deaths, crimes and serious intimidation.  It is an issue of which we should be very conscious and there are some fine examples of good practice in this regard.  Surveillance is very important in preventing the loss of life and the sale of drugs.</P>
        <P>While we are having this broad debate in regard to surveillance, I suggest there should be more surveillance of those involved in the purchase of drugs.  We hear a lot of talk about those who distribute the drugs, which is important, but I am talking about the posh, middle class people who go looking for their little bit of cocaine on a Friday or Saturday night.  They should be hammered because they are part of the problem, which is that there is a market for these drugs.  Drug dealers do not make money unless there is a huge market.  There is a reluctance <Col N="30"/>with regard to certain people but they should be hammered.  People in Irish life, including so-called celebrities who are involved in that trade and who sniff their bit of cocaine at the weekend, should be hammered and used as an example.  It is very easy to get the young fellow from Coolock or the inner city and hammer him for doing something related to drugs.  However, there are many people who are very well off, who have money and who generate a market for drugs and I have no mercy or sympathy for such people.  I refer specifically to those involved in the music industry, the media, television and such people, whom we all know and some of whom joke or brag about it.  That issue must be addressed.  There is a market and I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to hammer them.</P>
        <P>Regarding gangs, communities alienated from the police and society must be turned around and won over from the point of view of the Garda.  I recall when the late Tony Gregory was involved in the drugs issue in the north inner city.  The Garda and especially the drugs squad should not seek the respect of the community, they must earn that respect and when they do so, they will have the full support of the community.  That is a very important part of any strategy related to the broader debate.  I welcome amendments Nos. 13 and 19.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for their remarks.  I refer to Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s comments on hammering people who create a demand by taking recreational drugs.  While I am inclined to agree with him, I do not wish to paint everyone with the same brush.  He mentioned several professions.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be unfair to say that all members of the media or the music profession indulge.  However, I agree with his overall sentiment that some people fuel demand and clearly people are filling that gap.  It is the job of all of us to ensure that the proper legislation is in place and sufficient resources are given to the Garda, the Defence Forces, the Revenue Commissioners and the Customs and Excise to stamp it out as much as possible.</P>
        <P>I refer to the proposed amendments of which there are several and I have a long explanatory note.  It is best to stick to the note because it answers many of the questions raised.  Some of these issues were raised on Committee Stage and were examined.  I refer to amendment Nos. 13 and 23 moved by Deputy Rabbitte.  We examined these and consulted with the Office of the Attorney General.  The belief was the text in sections 5(7) and 8(5) is already broadly drafted and deliberately wide enough to encompass different places and ways in which surveillance may be initiated.  To use the words &ldquo;installing or operating a device&rdquo;, the term proposed in the amendment, would be more restrictive and could, therefore, have the inadvertent effect of narrowing the scope of the provision by suggesting an officer may only enter private property when he is installing or operating a device.  Otherwise, by implication, if he wishes to do something other than install or operate, he would have no right of entry.  This is the view of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo; in the interpretation section is sufficiently broad to include private property.  A judge already has discretion under the Bill to attach conditions to the authorisation as does a senior officer who issues an approval under sections 7 or 8.  Earlier, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to tracking devices and suggested that other than someone making a complaint there is no oversight for tracking devices.  This is not correct and there is provision to have oversight of all surveillance including tracking devices and non-tracking devices in the legislation.  This is covered in section 12.</P>
        <P>The procedure governing the right of entry to a place, whether private property or otherwise, and the initiation of surveillance in whatever form would be the subject of conditions imposed <Col N="31"/>by a judge when issuing an approval under sections 7 or 8.  My view, supported by the Office of the Attorney General, is that the text is sufficiently broad and already encompasses the Deputy&rsquo;s two proposals.</P>
        <P>I refer to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s amendments Nos. 17, 18, 24 and 25 which seek to provide for the inclusion of additional information in the written records of approval given by superior officers under sections 7 or 8 and to produce a written record of any variation to approvals given under the sections.  Sections 7 and 8 already provide for approvals of surveillance in cases of urgency and for the use of tracking devices respectively.  Judicial authorisation is not required.  Instead a superior officer of the relevant agency must approve any such action.  Under the legislation the officer must operate and determine whether it is necessary to use such instruments based on the criteria for a judge to give authorisation for a non-tracking device.  He must then make a written record of the approval granted.  It must provide details of the facts pertinent to the approval including such practical details as the type of device used, the subject of surveillance, the duration of the surveillance and any conditions attached.  The written record is not intended as the basis on which to grant an approval.  The justification for the request and the type of device envisaged will be included in the application for approval.  Section 7 would only apply in cases of extreme urgency and in which it would be not operationally practical to apply for a judicial authorisation.  I do not believe the additional information proposed by the Deputy is appropriate in this context.</P>
        <P>With regard to written records and reports, provision is made in both sections for the superior officer granting the approval to make a report as soon as possible and, in any case, not later than seven days after the surveillance concerned has been completed, in which he or she must specify the grounds on which the approval was granted.  This would, by its very nature, include details of any variation sought or granted and such a report must be made by a Garda officer of the rank of at least assistant commissioner, or a similar rank in the other two organisations.</P>
        <P>I refer to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s amendments Nos. 19 and 26, which provide that reports made in the case of every approval granted under section 7 or 8 should also be made to the designated judge.  The function of the designated judge is to keep under review the operations of sections 4 to 8.  The judge may investigate any case in which an authorisation or approval has been granted, varied or renewed and, to this end, has access to all written records of approvals, reports and other relevant documents.  I do not believe the requirement whereby a report of every approval granted should be furnished to the designated judge is appropriate nor do I believe it would be operationally efficient.  The system for the review and the requirements to provide information to the designated judge, set out in section 13, are based on similar provisions in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  The legislation is based on the 1993 Act because it has been in operation for more than 15 years and the oversight provision is considered efficient and effective.</P>
        <P>I refer to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s amendment No. 20, which provides for the deletion of section 8 dealing with tracking devices in its entirety.  I further refer to amendment Nos. 21, 22 and 27 which propose to reduce the four month maximum duration provision to three months and to amend section 4(5)(<i>a</i>) which a device considered for use should be the least intrusive means available when making the application for the use of a tracking device.</P>
        <P>The effect of amendment No. 20, that is, the deletion of section 8, would be to make the use of tracking devices by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na subject to judicial authorisation rather than the system of approval currently provided for in the Bill.  The use of tracking devices is regarded as a less intrusive means of surveillance to other surveillance devices.  Tracking devices are defined for the purposes of the Bill as devices which provide information regarding the location of a person, vehicle or thing.  In providing for a system of approval rather than authorisation <Col N="32"/>the Bill seeks to achieve a balance between the necessity for fast action in the placing of tracking devices and the provision of an effective regulatory framework for their use.  It is subject to oversight as per section 13.  Tracking devices monitor the movements of persons, vehicles or things.  The opportunity for and timing of their placement is critical if they are to be used successfully.  A tracking device can be attached to a package, for example, a suspected drugs shipment as it arrives in port or to a vehicle.  In many cases its placement will be required at short notice otherwise the opportunity to prevent or solve a crime can be lost because the vehicle or package will have moved on.  As with approval for surveillance in cases of urgency, it is imperative that the Bill provides for an efficient and practical system which can be used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and which does not result in unnecessary delay while a court application is being sought.  Such a delay might hinder or jeopardise the investigation.  As a counter-balance, the Bill provides for a stringent system of control for the use of tracking devices which includes rules on record keeping and reporting where such an approval is given.</P>
        <P>In the case of amendments Nos. 21 and 27, I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the period of four months but if considered necessary, the Minister may, by regulation, and in the interests of the protection of the privacy and other rights of a person and other issues such as the security of the State, be given the means to review that period of four months.  We will keep this provision under review.  The discussions with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicate that a period of four months is not unreasonable for the purpose and use of tracking devices.  The use of a tracking device is regarded as a less intrusive means of surveillance than other surveillance devices and therefore it is not appropriate it should be included in the matters to which a superior officer would have regard when considering whether to grant an approval.  While I understand some of the sentiments expressed by Members and while I understand the thinking behind Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s amendments, that he is trying to assist in suggesting that it be for the purpose of installing or operating, our strong advice is that if we are to restrict it to the issue of installing and operating, it would inadvertently restrict the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the operation of the devices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of my amendment No. 13 is not in any way to restrict the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out this function.  On the contrary, what I have been seeking to do is to make clear for the avoidance of doubt that this particular issue would be protected.  I will not press the issue but I am genuinely confused by the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  The Minister says he is rejecting the amendment on advice that it would otherwise impede entry by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a member of the Revenue Commissioners or a member of the Defence Forces.  I find this difficult.  It is plain to me that what is being authorised in subsection (7) is a person, accompanied by another person if necessary, to enter, if necessary by the use of reasonable force, any place for the purpose of initiating and carrying out the authorised surveillance.  The language used in my amendment is &ldquo;for the purpose of installing or operating such a surveillance&rdquo;.  I do not know if there is a difference in terms of carrying out surveillance as distinct from operating surveillance.  I am genuinely puzzled that this is the reason for rejecting the amendment.  The British legislation is clear.  If the Minister thinks he is secured against challenge on it, in respect of private property or damage to private property, I will take his word for it but I am unable to see what he has explained as being the reason for not accepting my amendment. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision &ldquo;initiating or carrying out the authorised surveillance&rdquo; is broadly drafted in order to catch every circumstance.  If the words, &ldquo;installing or operating&rdquo; were to be included, my advice from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that this would be somewhat restrictive in operation.  I ask the Deputy to agree that the way in which it has been drafted is <Col N="33"/>better from a grammatical and linguistic point of view.  The word, &ldquo;installing&rdquo; describes a particular action, whereas &ldquo;initiating&rdquo; may well be a broader action.  I ask the Deputy to accede to my request. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The amendment provides that the application to vary or renew an authorisation should be accompanied by a copy of a written record of approval, a summary of the result of the surveillance and the reason continued surveillance is required.  However, section 6 deals with applications to vary or renew authorisations granted under section 5.  It does not provide for the renewal of approvals granted in emergency situations under section 7 and where a written record of approval is made.  Continuation of an approval granted under section 7 is provided for by the authorisation procedure of section 4(4) and the documentation to be provided is specified in that subsection on the basis that it is an authorisation following an emergency approval.  Where an application is made for a variation or approval of the existing authorisation under section 6, it will be at the judge&rsquo;s discretion to request such information as he or she considers necessary.  In practice the applicant will be obliged to disclose all relevant matters.  I do not think this amendment is necessary.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I have proposed similar amendments to a number of justice Bills.  The amendment will give greater scrutiny to the House when making or changing regulations.  In a number of places this Bill gives the Minister power to make regulations.  Amendments Nos. 28 and 31 seek to make those regulations subject to prior approval by the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 57 proposes a more fundamental change to section 16.  The amendment would substitute a paragraph so that regulations would not merely be laid before the Houses but would be subject to the prior approval of the relevant Oireachtas committee, currently the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.</P>
        <P>The amendments would make the Minister more accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Given that the Minister usually has the support of Members on the Government side, this should not present a problem.  However, the amendments would allow the House, on a regular basis, to review what is happening and ensure that regulations are proportionate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is considerable merit in amendment No. 28, not only for this Bill but for the manner in which the Executive treats the Legislature.  In recent years, we have become accustomed to legislation by regulation.  The power vested in Ministers has been expanded and developed in a way that was not intended by the Constitution.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">This debate is broader than these amendments to the Bill.  When a Minister is in office for the best part of 20 years, one can see how the Legislature can become an encumbrance or nuisance.  We have legislation by regulation, which is wrong.  I hope we will have a broader debate on this issue in the context of D&aacute;il reform and the manner in which this Assembly is treated by the Executive.  This is true of all Departments and not only of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Regulations are introduced on a weekly basis which never come before the House and whose import is unknown until a problem arises.  We then see that there has been no input whatsoever by the Legislature and matters are dealt with by way of Executive diktat and regulation.</P>
        <P>This has been commented upon by the courts.  Recently, we have seen how the courts are prepared to seek out the intention of the Legislature to determine what is meant by a particular piece of legislation, whether a subsection or section of an Act.  The attention of the court is sometimes drawn to the intention of the legislators.  This difficulty also applies to guillotined legislation.  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is silent on a matter, it is difficult to determine what its intention was at any given time.  This is what will happen to this and every other Bill passed between now and the end of this session because they will be enacted by way of guillotine and determined in some cases without any debate.</P>
        <P>The same is true of regulations.  The Minister knows the extent to which regulation is now used, compared to what was the case some decades ago.  This is another feature of the arrogance of Ministers and their Departments.  They seem to think they can proceed by way of regulation and the D&aacute;il will remain in enforced silence on the matter.  This applies to more than just today&rsquo;s legislation.  It is a matter which needs to be adverted to in a serious way, perhaps by the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Flanagan is talking more broadly about the issue of how we address regulation.  The provision in subsection 16(3) is the standard one used for all legislation.  It states:</P><Col N="35"/>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Every regulation under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it has been made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Deputy Flanagan claims that regulations are being used more and more.  In fact, they are not.  As a result of a number of court decisions, more and more Ministers err on the side of caution by introducing primary rather than secondary legislation.  I can think of a case in point.  Legislation relating to the retention of data will, I hope, soon be published.  Originally, it was felt that would be done by regulation and that we had the power to do so.  On the advice of the Attorney General, it was felt that we should introduce primary legislation.  My experience in the past number of years is the opposite of what Deputy Flanagan says.  Ministers are not using secondary legislation more and more.  On marine matters, of which I have experience, for decades Governments of every colour used regulations at quick remove.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The courts said regulation should not be used, particularly for serious issues.  Government and the Legislature have responded to that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot accept the amendment.  We should proceed on the basis of what we are doing currently in all legislation.  In the context of D&aacute;il reform we may find a better way of looking at regulations.  Regulations often deal with fairly unimportant issues and facilitate legislation which has already been put in place and which is operating.  I would worry that waiting for regulations might impede the implementation of legislation which we have already passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The courts would be happy if regulations were subject to some type of oversight and debate in the House rather than simply placed in the Oireachtas Library.  The intention is not to delay.  The Minister is correct that some of these amendments are not contentious.  The amendment seeks to give more powers to the House.  There is nothing to prevent a series of these regulations being made, given that a number of provisions in the Bill permit regulations to be made by the Minister.  The Minister can schedule all of them together.  It is similar to how the European scrutiny committee deals at present with approximately 400 European regulations, directives and so forth.  Some of them go through with no major scrutiny by the committee but are agreed on the basis of the advice of the officials and the related documentation.  At any stage, however, a member of the committee, or any Member of the House who attends the meeting, can call a halt and seek scrutiny or clarification of the measure.  That is the type of system that should be in place given the number of regulations.</P>
        <P>The Minister might be correct in terms of the weight of legislation versus regulation but virtually every recent legislative measure from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that has come before the House has given the Minister power to make regulations.  These are important measures.  Sometimes the teeth of the legislation can be contained in the regulations that are made afterwards, and we do not have an opportunity to review them in every case.  That is the basis for proposing these amendments.  It is not an effort to delay the legislation or to prevent the objective of the Bill coming into effect.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  It is to ensure that the collective wisdom of the House is brought to bear to ensure the best regulations are put in place.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage.  The amendment is to ensure that any Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission investigation or civil case is taken into account when making these decisions.  I mentioned a case on Committee Stage, which I will not outline in detail now, where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board destroyed all its records despite the fact that there was an outstanding civil case which was dependent on the records.  When such a decision is made about material, there should be an effort to ensure that the information is not still required by, for example, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission if it is carrying out an investigation.  It is a matter of having a checklist before information is destroyed.  There could be a civil case by an individual who has been subject to this type of surveillance and is dependent on the records to prove his or her case.  We must ensure the legislation does not hamper justice being done.</P>

We had a discussion about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission earlier as to whether it should have surveillance powers.

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 10 provides for the restriction of disclosure of the existence of authorisations and other documents.  The amendment provides for the making of ministerial regulations relating to the disclosure or non-disclosure of the existence of authorisations or approvals to the person who is the subject of the authorisation or approval or to other persons whose interests are materially affected by it in certain specified circumstances.  Disclosure would be provided for only where it would be consistent with the purposes for which the authorisation or approval was issued, with the security of the State, with the protection of the person&rsquo;s privacy and other rights and where it would be unlikely to hinder the investigation.  Any such regulations may require consultation by the Minister with relevant parties and may set out those categories of persons whose interests may be materially affected by the authorisations or approvals for surveillance.  The regulations may also provide for the terms and conditions limiting the extent of disclosure.</P>
        <P>This amendment takes account of European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence, which has found that a provision allowing disclosure in at least certain circumstances is required and that it is an important safeguard where an improper use of surveillance might occur.  A proposal along these lines was suggested by the Irish Human Rights Commission in its observations on the Bill on the basis that it provides for the balance between the operational needs of the agencies involved in carrying out surveillance and the protection of the rights of the individual.</P>

This amendment extends the notification procedure to include any other person whose interests are materially affected by the relevant contravention.  This ensures that collateral subjects, that is, persons who have been monitored in the course of the surveillance operation directed at another person, will be also notified by the referee where there has been a relevant contravention.</P>

The amendment provides that, following an investigation which results in the conclusion there has been a relevant contravention, the referee can decline to notify the applicant or the other person of that conclusion if he is of the view that it would not be in the public interest to do so.

The Bill mentions the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission <Col N="39"/>in the case of a contravention by a garda.  We have an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  In this case, if there were to be a contravention by members of the Defence Forces, it should be referred to that person.  In the case of a contravention by the Revenue Commissioners, it should be referred to the Office of the Ombudsman.  It is the intention that the relevant ombudsmen should be contacted when there is a contravention by a member of the Garda, the Defence Forces or the Revenue Commissioners.  The amendment  is also to ensure that the referee must &mdash; as in &ldquo;shall&rdquo; &mdash; make the report to those bodies.  That is all.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 36 allows for the decision to be appealed to the District Court and gives the public an appeal mechanism which is available at the referee&rsquo;s decision, at a lower rather than a higher level in the courts.  As far as I recall, that is the level of the designated judge.  This keeps the process accessible to the public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s amendments propose to refer complaints in respect of the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces and the Office of the Ombudsman, respectively.  Concerning complaints made by the public in respect of the Garda, the section already provides that complaints regarding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are referred by the complaints referee to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</P>
        <P>However, with regard to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, that ombudsman investigates complaints into internal matters by members and former members of the Defence Forces.  It does not provide any remit with regard to complaints by members of the public and I do not believe it is the appropriate body in that context for the complaints referee to report to in respect of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the Office of Ombudsman investigates complaints against administrative actions of Departments.  The Ombudsman is empowered to make recommendations only.  Her findings are not binding and, therefore, I believe it is more appropriate that any report regarding the Revenue Commissioners should be made to the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal to provide for appeals to the District Court, the complaints procedure in the Bill mirrors equivalent provisions in the Interception of Postal Packages and Telecommunications Messages Act 1993.  The complaints referee will be the holder of the Office of Complaints Referee, under the interception legislation.  In any event, I see no need to provide for a special appeals mechanism against a decision of the complaints referee.  The making of an application to the complaints referee does not preclude the applicant from pursuing other legal remedies available.</P>

They provide that where such a referral is made the referee must investigate the matter.  The Bill allows the referee to report a matter to the designated judge.

        <P LI="3" el="5">(vi) any recommendations for legislative or practice changes that the designated judge considers necessary to safeguard against mistake and ensure full compliance in practice with ECHR standards.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The changes proposed in amendments Nos. 41 to 45, inclusive, are based on a critique made of the oversight facility and are intended to try to ensure we have the best possible oversight.  The Bill draws on the oversight model contained in the Interception of Postal Packages and Telecommunications Messages Act 1993, which I believe to be grossly inadequate.  In a critique of that model in the context of an article on data retention, Mr. T. J. McIntyre, a lecturer in law at UCD, and chair of Digital Rights Ireland, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">This oversight mechanism has been almost entirely opaque from the outset.  The annual reports of the designated judge since that position was created in 1993 have consisted every year of no more than a single line stating that the operation of the Act has been kept under review and its provisions are being complied with.</P>
        <P FLI="0">For example, there has been no discussion of what steps have been taken to keep the operation of the Act under review, whether individual files were reviewed, the volume of surveillance being carried out, whether mistakes were made in carrying out surveillance, such as the targeting of a wrong individual and, if so, what steps were taken to safeguard against such mistakes in future.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 42 seeks to ensure that one can complain to the complaints referee about more than the authorisations under section 7 on urgent cases involving the Garda that are only approvable under section 8.  What if one wants to make a complaint about the conduct of the surveillance judicially approved under section 5 or varied thereafter?</P><Col N="42"/>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 have been submitted on the back of the Irish Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s document presented to Deputies and seek to ensure that the report of the designated judge reveals more details.  In this way, we would know whether the mechanisms were being overused.  A proper facility must be provided in the House to afford us more details than have been suggested to date.</P>
        <P>As I am unsure about the recommendation, I will revert on amendment No. 45.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Deputy is endeavouring to do in these amendments is to extend the functions of the designated judge under this section.  A High Court judge is designated to oversee the operation of the Act&rsquo;s provisions and to make regular reports to the Taoiseach on related matters.  To give the judge more powers would confuse the situation.  The judge&rsquo;s oversight function is distinct from the function of the complaints referee.  Allowing complaints to be made directly to the judge instead of the referee would serve to confuse the separate oversight procedures and lessen the safeguards provided.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will note that I am amending the Bill to allow the designated judge to use his or her discretion to refer a matter to the complaints referee for investigation.  This proposal was made by the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, in its observations.  Our amendment to section 11 will address the types of concern that the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments seek to address.</P>
        <P>Regarding amendment No. 44, provision has already been made for the designated judge to have access to information and relevant documents upon request.  This is in keeping with the role of the designated judge, which is to provide oversight of the system.  The role is not intended to be one of ongoing continuous assessment.  Therefore, the existing provisions are sufficient to meet the needs of the designated judge in the performance of his or her function.</P>
        <P>Regarding the period in which a report is laid before the Houses, I remind the Deputy that provision is made for the Taoiseach, after consultation with the designated judge, to exclude matters from a report that the Taoiseach considers prejudicial to the security of the State.  Sufficient time must be provided to allow proper consideration to be given to this matter.  As such, the six-month period before the report is laid before the Houses is appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>

	<P>That is important.</P>
        <P>I am not sure about the precedent, but I am curious about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s involvement.  Is the lead Minister not the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the relevant Ministers &mdash; the Ministers for Defence and, where the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, Finance &mdash; being the other Ministers in a less leading role?  I note the Taoiseach&rsquo;s involvement.  Has other legislation involved the Taoiseach in the submission of reports or in liaising with a designated judge?  Should the lead Minister not be the one to communicate with the judge if, from time to time, communication was considered desirable?  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s involvement is curious.  There may be a simple answer, but is this the norm?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="43"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Due to the serious nature of the matter and particularly given the fact that three Ministers are involved, it was felt that the designated judge should liaise with the Taoiseach as the overall person with responsibility for the Government and the State&rsquo;s security.  This provision elevates the seriousness of what we are doing in this legislation, namely, invasive surveillance of persons and private property.  It gives the Taoiseach a key role in the issue&rsquo;s oversight.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">By moving this amendment, I am trying to strike a balance with the rights of the community and the victims of crime.  We discussed this on Committee Stage and the Minister was of the view that it is adequately provided for as matters stand.  I wanted, however, to be clear that where the court has a discretion to allow or exclude evidence, the rights of the defendant must be considered but so must the rights of society and the innocent victim.  The Minister said he would consider that idea before Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We looked at it and I appreciate what the Deputy wants to achieve here.  We must, however, take into account the constitutional rights of citizens, the European Convention on Human Rights and privacy issues.  Deputy Noonan rightly stated last night that there is a balance between protecting the rights of the wider community while defending the rights related to the privacy of particular individuals and we believe we have struck the right balance in the Bill.  Sections 14(3) and 14(4) set out the criteria a judge must consider in deciding to admit evidence attained in circumstances where there has been an error or omission on the face of an authorisation or approval, or where there has been a failure to comply with a requirement of the authorisation or approval.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment provides that in addition to the criteria listed, the court should also have regard to the rights of the community and the victim, if any, of the crime being investigated when determining if evidence may be admitted.  We have considered this amendment in consultation with the Attorney General and we have been advised that the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal would be inappropriate in this context.  The court&rsquo;s primary concern in this instance is to decide if the evidence would be of use in the case to be tried.  To introduce a third element with regard to the victim&rsquo;s rights at this point might prejudice the outcome and would be inappropriate in that respect.</P>
        <P>The court must decide whether the action taken was in good faith and whether it was in the interests of justice to admit the evidence, having regard to certain matters &mdash; if the error was serious or merely technical, the nature of any rights infringed, any circumstances of urgency, the possible prejudicial effect of the information concerned and the probative or conclusive value of the information.  The presiding judge in the decision on admission of evidence would take into account the rights of the community and the victim of the crime in question.</P>

	<P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I was pleased to facilitate the passage of this legislation.  It was originally a &ldquo;covert surveillance&rdquo; Bill but the word &ldquo;covert&rdquo; was put to one side since publication.</P>
        <P>When the Minister talks about pieces of the jigsaw, however, resources and enforcement are other important components.  We can pass all the legislation the Government wants but until the legislation is accompanied by appropriate resources and enforcement practices, there will be a gap in the crack down on criminal gangs and the mayhem they perpetrate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister and Deputy Flanagan.  I will be glad to see the Bill enacted.  The Minister has acknowledged its similarity to the Bill I published on behalf of the Labour Party out of the conviction that intelligence gathering by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the best way to deal with this phenomenon that is growing worse.  I hope we will see results from the legislative changes we have made in the Bill which will allow material gathered to be admissible in court, hopefully leading to a higher rate of convictions of those serious criminals who are attacking our society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Flanagan is right.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is continuing with the tradition of heavy legislative output, with significant numbers of new laws being enacted when the most important factor is the application of the law and its enforcement.  It is no longer easy to point to major lacunae in the law as being the reason that these gangland figures still hold sway in some communities.</P>
        <P>Whenever the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Powers of Surveillance) Bill was published by the Labour Party, I published the Witness Protection Programme (No. 2) Bill to put the witness protection programme on a statutory footing, as was advised by the superior courts.  That will hopefully make a contribution whereby some of the more serious gangland figures will be more likely to be put behind bars on the evidence of one of their own gang members.  We have not progressed in that regard but I agree it is not a gap in the law generally that means we have such a problem in so many parts of the country.  Much of the problem is driven by the drugs trade, which affects my part of Dublin very seriously.  The entire west of Dublin is under enormous pressure owing to drug pushing.  New gangs are emerging all the time and it is a very serious problem.  My sympathy is with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in seeking to contain the problem but it must be realised it is doing terrible damage to some of our communities.  I hope the Bill we enact today will make a contribution towards better enforcement.</P>

	<P>We have done a good day&rsquo;s work.  We welcome the Bill despite our concerns.  We tried, through our amendments, to have a better Bill.  I hope the new powers will be used to good effect to ensure criminals are targeted and brought to justice within the boundaries set out in the legislation and that the legislation will be of benefit to An Garda and society as a whole.  We set down in law the powers available to An Garda.  I hope the concerns we raised will not prove to have been well founded.  If they are, I hope we will deal with any shortfall as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>This Bill could be a useful tool in the fight against crime and, as Deputy Rabbitte stated, particularly in the fight against drug dealers, who seem to operate with impunity in some areas.  The powers we have granted to An Garda can be used if the force is properly resourced to tackle major criminal gangs in this city and elsewhere throughout the State.</P>

    <Title>Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008: From the Seanad. </Title>
        <P>The D&aacute;il went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Seanad amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Section 7: In page 13, subsection (5), lines 6 and 7, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;by&rdquo; in line 6 down to and including &ldquo;Executive)&rdquo; in line 7 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;by persons (who may be employees of the Executive)&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment was accepted in the Seanad.  Instead of having the legislation refer to only one &ldquo;person&rdquo;, it now refers to the plural, &ldquo;persons&rdquo;.  Clearly there will be a number of different persons involved in the multidisciplinary team.  Members of the Seanad felt the use of the singular term &ldquo;person&rdquo; was inadequate and we were happy to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Seanad amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Cregan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, and 8 and 9 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
        <P>Seanad amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Section 17: In page 22, lines 31 to 34, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2)(<i>a</i>) Where the Executive has received a request for payment of ancillary State support and the Executive is satisfied that it is appropriate that payment of such support be made, the Executive shall make an order in accordance with this section.</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>b</i>) The Executive shall not make a payment in respect of ancillary State support prior to the making of an order by the Executive charging the interest in the relevant chargeable asset with the secured amount.&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 ensure the legal basis is explicit and beyond doubt and that the Property Registration Authority can make and register the charge.  These amendments were tabled after a submission was received from the Property Registration Authority.  The provisions are to ensure there is legal certainty, which the authority felt was desirable.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 4 is to ensure that, in keeping with the policy in the legislation, money can be recovered.  Amendment Nos. 5 and 9 ensure the order can be released when the money is paid.  Amendment No. 8 ensures the format of the receipt, in addition to the format of the application, can be prescribed by regulation.  These amendments, which all refer to charging orders, are technical and were suggested to us by the Property Registration Authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments are all we are discussing today.  Will there be an opportunity to vote on the Bill as a whole?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>One can vote only on the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>While some of these amendments may appear innocuous, issues arise in respect of some of them, certainly amendment No. 4 on the mortgage issue.  If a mortgage pre-exists the mortgage holder&rsquo;s entry into a nursing home and there are payments still due, will it be the first debt to be paid?  This is not clear.  One could be left with a property whose mortgage value exceeds the equity value, particularly in the current climate.  If a patient who <Col N="48"/>enters a nursing home passes away three years later and 15% of the fee has been paid up front, what will occur if that patient&rsquo;s property was worth &euro;450,000 on his or her entering the nursing home but is only worth &euro;250,000 at the time of his or her death?  How will the bill be calculated in this case?</P>
        <P>With the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s permission, may I make a few broader points?  I am deeply unhappy with the Bill.  Many of the issues we raised have not been addressed, particularly that of independent financial assessment.  Issues arise over the valuation of patients&rsquo; houses and assets.  A person&rsquo;s bank shares, stock or dividends could be assessed as valueless at the time he or she enters a nursing home.</P>
        <P>The issue concerning the rights of siblings at the time of application has not been addressed.  I refer to siblings who may have been living together all their lives.  A sister in such circumstances may have decided to stay at home to mind the house.  Such arrangements are not uncommon in Irish society.</P>
        <P>Two issues arise over capping, one of which pertains to capping in respect of the scheme itself.  If money runs out, what happens to the assessments?  The medical assessment is not independent and this has not been addressed.  The HSE is to provide care and assess people for care.  Will the threshold move up and down?  Although we discussed this before, it is important to highlight the matter.</P>
        <P>Age Action Ireland is distinctly unhappy about this Bill and the manner in which it is less than clear on the position of those who are charged for being placed in a hospital bed for a long period because there is not a more suitable place for them in the community.  The issues associated with geography and the National Treatment Purchase Fund have not been addressed, including the National Treatment Purchase Fund&rsquo;s absolute right to omit or admit a particular nursing home from or to the scheme, depending on whether the home can arrange a reasonable fee.  Far too much power is being given to the HSE.</P>
        <P>I received an e-mail only yesterday from a lady who has been living all her life with her cousin.  They live as sisters but a cousin is not regarded by the legislation as a connected person.  The lady, to whom the house is left, believes she may well end up in a nursing home and precede her cousin in death, thereby leaving the cousin seriously discommoded and disadvantaged.</P>
        <P>There is still no cap pertaining to assets.  The sop that the Minister made in an amendment on an earlier Stage, referring to circumstances in the event of sudden illness, was totally turned over by the caveats in section 8, which bound a person to his or her business in that he or she must have been involved, for the greater part of his or her working days, in that business before taking ill.  He or she must continue to be bound to the business for the foreseeable future.  As I stated on Report Stage, the requirement that one be bonded to the land or a business smacks of feudalism.</P>
        <P>The definitions are characterised by laxity.  &ldquo;Sudden illness&rdquo; is not defined.  Is it a stroke or cancer?  How is it defined?  Is it of sudden onset and, if so, what does this mean?  Is it the last element of a well-known illness, multi-infarct dementia?  In this case a patient may be managing the illness but finally receives the small insult to the brain that changes his or her circumstances.  I am deeply unhappy about all these issues and am of the view the Bill must be opposed.  If this is only opportunity afforded me to do so I will vehemently oppose amendment No. 4 and unless some concessions are given on it amendment I will press to a vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have difficulties with some of the technical amendments in this group but I have concerns about amendments Nos. 2 and 4.  The time to debate this <Col N="49"/>legislation is limited and we spent a great deal of time engaging with the Minister on the earlier Stages in the D&aacute;il but this is our first opportunity to discuss these amendments from the Seanad.  </P>
        <P>The Minister said that these further amendments have been tabled at the suggestion of the Property Registration Authority.  What legal advice has she received on them?  I presume she sought and received legal advice because they raise tricky legal and constitutional issues particularly in respect of amendment No. 4.  It states that the HSE &ldquo;may&rdquo; but the implication is that any court of competent jurisdiction can, in accordance with the legislation, award money to the HSE in respect of ancillary State support for properties which are subject to a mortgage.</P>
        <P>I am not a legal expert &mdash; none of us here is &mdash; but that appears very complicated in respect of property rights and the Constitution.  It is even more complicated for a family farm.  On Committee Stage many members of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Health and Children raised concerns about the family farm and this legislation.  The problem also affects the family home and property in general because property involves complicated family relationships.  If one family member must go into long-stay care, whether in a public or private bed, it appears that this ancillary State support gets first call on any money available.  I may not be interpreting this correctly but the legislation seems to intend that this money will be paid before anything else is paid or settled or anybody else receives his or her share of the property, or the mortgage is paid.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about amendment No. 2 because it states that no ancillary State support will be paid out until such time until the property has been lodged as security for the charges.  I am not sure what legal and constitutional issues arise but generally speaking when there is a problem about property after a death people have equal rights to whatever money is available.  This amendment seems to intend that the ancillary State support grant will have a greater right than others to recoup money.</P>
        <P>We have expressed our general concerns about the Bill on its various Stages.  We are particularly concerned about the cap on resources.  What happens for example, if somebody qualifies for nursing home support who has also applied for ancillary State support and the process of claiming rights on the property commences but the money in the general part of the scheme has run out for that year?  The person may not be able to exercise his or her right because it is curtailed by the lack of money.</P>
        <P>What is the general policy on long-stay beds?  There is a greater dependence on the private sector and a growing number of private nursing homes, many of which benefit from tax breaks.  When the Select Committee on Health and Children dealt with the Estimates it learned that the 2008 target for long-stay public beds had not been reached.  Under this legislation there will be a greater dependence on the private sector and I have a fundamental difficulty with that move.  I would like an assurance that public policy on health care will be to maintain and grow the number of public long-stay beds in accordance with the 2001 strategy document, part of which commits to increasing not only acute hospital beds but also long-stay beds.</P>
        <P>I share Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s concerns about assessing the value of the property and ensuring that it is fair.  Property values go up and down and have varied widely in the past year.  Will the Minister clarify how that will affect the ancillary State support grant when it comes back from the property?</P>
        <P>These are our main concerns about these amendments but we have more general concerns about the Bill which we have already expressed.  I would be slow to pass amendments such as these without being certain that those legal difficulties do not exist and that we are protecting the rights of the person who needs the long-stay beds and of all the family members who have an interest in the family property.  I too am particularly concerned about amendment No. 4.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="50"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There seems to be some misunderstanding. Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s example could not happen.  If one does not own the property there is no question of the HSE being in a position to make a charge against that property.  If, for example, the property is 80% mortgaged that is a priority.  At the time of registration the priorities are dealt with.  At any time if somebody&rsquo;s financial circumstances change or the property values change that can be reassessed.  For example, where dividends from bank shares form part of one&rsquo;s income and banks do not pay out dividends, as they have not done here recently, that would greatly affect one&rsquo;s income stream but that can be reassessed at any stage.</P>
        <P>The Irish Farmers Association has genuinely and warmly welcomed the changes we have made.  I met it recently and what applies to farms applies equally to other businesses.  It is not exclusive to farms but the case was initially put forward because of concerns in the farming community and among its representatives.</P>
        <P>In respect of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, we are going over the main provisions of the Bill.  I am happy to do so. The National Treatment Purchase Fund was given the remit because it is independent of the HSE.  An organisation independent of the organisation charged with supporting and providing public health services would be responsible for procuring from the private nursing home sector.  It is generally acknowledged that it has a good track record in this regard.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P>To be able to participate in the scheme, which is voluntary, the nursing home must be approved from the financial cost point of view by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The taxpayer will fund 70% to 80% of the cost of this care throughout the country and the purpose of these provisions is to ensure that we get high quality and reasonable value for money.  The new regulations come into effect next week.  The new independent inspectorate starts on July 1, which is next Wednesday, and from here on public and private nursing homes will be inspected on the same basis.</P>
        <P>With regard to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s query on capacity, this year 790 new long-term beds and 317 replacement beds will come on stream.  Much of the investment over the past two years has been to upgrade current facilities and, in many cases, substantially reduce the number of beds because as Deputies are aware, many of our long-stay facilities are 120 years old.  They are former workhouses and totally unsuitable to the standards we are entitled to expect in 2009.  A huge amount of the investment is in replacement, which often leads to a substantial reduction in the number of beds.  That is important for the quality of life of the residents and so that we meet the standards that are now the law.  Existing facilities have a number of years to meet those standards.</P>
        <P>If it was not for the participation of the private nursing home sector and the provisions introduced by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s party colleague and former Minister for Health, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in 1993, when nursing home subvention for the private sector first came into operation here, we would have been in a very difficult situation because the vast majority of older people in long-term care &mdash; I believe the figure is 13,000 or 14,000 &mdash; are in facilities funded by private providers.</P>
        <P>The concern of the State has to be the financial supports that we give and at present 90% of the care costs in the public sector is paid by the Exchequer or those for whom a bed has been procured in the private sector.  Those who had to procure their own beds must pay on average 50%, 60% or 70% of the cost and that is grossly unfair and inequitable.  The purpose of the fair deal is to bring equity to those situations.</P>
        <P>I accept that some Deputies would prefer all of the care to be paid for, there are very few countries if any where long-term care is treated on the same basis as acute care.  I know those who represent older people and some geriatricians have concerns about the fact that we will <Col N="51"/>put a charge against the home of the older person where they have ownership or part ownership of the home.  However, unless we do so we will not be able to introduce this equitable scheme and, as I stated, very few countries treat long-term care the same as acute care and if people live at home they have care costs.</P>
        <P>Resources are capped and, as I stated on many occasions in this House and regardless of who is or has been in this position, there was never unlimited resources and there never will be.  No country in the world has unlimited resources.  The resources are capped but we believe the Estimates we have made to begin the operation of the scheme in the autumn of this year are realistic to cover the demand.</P>
        <P>The people who speak to me must be different to those who speak to Deputy Reilly; we get more calls on this issue from family members of older people in care than on any other issue.  This morning we received calls from people wondering when it will happen and when will it be passed.</P>
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister receive calls from Age Action Ireland? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes and on Second Stage I acknowledged that it has some reservations about the charge on the home.  However, at present people are forced to sell their homes and run down their assets to pay for their care.  This ends all of that and creates an equitable situation.  Perhaps in an ideal world we would love to do some things differently but this will provide a radical change to how long-term care is supported and it is an important measures.  With regard to connected persons, on Committee and Report Stages in this House we made a change to include siblings so the sister relationship mentioned by Deputy Reilly will be covered under the definition of connected persons.</P>
        <P>Specifically on the amendment, the property registration authority wanted to make it clear and put it beyond doubt that a charge can be made; it is a legal technicality and we took the advice of the Attorney General on the matter.  The purpose of Seanad amendment No. 4 is to ensure there are no technicalities to prevent the HSE being able to have its money returned to it and the reference to &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo; is to the ancillary loan.  There is no question of this loan, when it is registered, coming ahead of other mortgages on the House or whatever the case may be.  Seanad amendments Nos. 5 and 9 are tidying up amendments to bring more closely together matters in various sections of the Bill.  Seanad amendment No. 5 removes the reference to the release of charging orders from section 17(14) while Seanad amendment No. 9 ensures the relevant reference is reflected instead in section 28.  It is a technical legal tidying up arrangement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was it necessary to include Seanad amendment No. 4?  I assume that if a debt is owed to anybody that he or she is free to go to court and have the debt paid in so far as it can be paid.  In her initial contribution the Minister stated that it is the policy that loans be repaid; of course it is the policy that loans be repaid.  However, it is also the policy in the banking sector that loans be repaid but many people are not repaying their loans at present and it is costing the taxpayer a fortune as a result.  There should not be any need to include a stronger ability to get the money back in the case of elderly people in long-stay beds as than to get money back from people who borrowed from banks in any other way.</P>
        <P>What is the effect of the words, &ldquo;as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo;?  Does it mean that somehow or other the HSE has a prior claim on money to anybody else who might have a claim with regard to a deceased person?  Perhaps I did not express it very well but that was one of the questions I asked in my initial contribution.  There seems to be a stitching-in of the HSE getting its money before anybody else who may be as equally entitled or equally in need of the money when somebody is deceased.  I am concerned that <Col N="52"/>other people may have an equal right but a greater right is being conveyed on the HSE which, generally speaking, one cannot do with regard to property rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister commenting on the NTPF but the problem is whether there is an appeals process or an independent arbitrator in a case where there is no agreement on a fee between a nursing home and the NTPF.  There is no cap on the assets or no recognition for a case where one of two or three siblings who have lived together on a farm for all their lives goes into care for ten years and accumulates a bill of &euro;300,000 and to pay it the farm must be sold.  The value of the farm may have increased or decreased, we have seen huge variations in land prices.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is no regard for somebody with a rightful expectation of inheriting the farm, for example a nephew who worked on it.  The same goes for business, as this is not just related to farming, where the relevant elderly people live over the business and a nephew or niece runs the business below, have an expectation and is remunerated by the people concerned with that in mind.  Many stories have been recorded in well-written novels in this country of the disappointment and hardship people suffer when expectation is not met.  This could turn into a nightmare for some people.  If the Minister were able to offer some comfort on the issue, the Fine Gael Party would be less inclined to object to it.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not able to give the Deputy any comfort or expectation.  I recently met a nursing home owner who, having cared for an elderly gentleman for a number of years without payment, lived on the expectation that, on the death of the said individual, the nursing home would be able to reclaim its charges.  The home owner later discovered, however, that the person in question left his farm and property to an animal welfare organisation, if memory serves me correctly.  I cannot legislate for expectation.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am more concerned about cases involving relatives who work on the individual&rsquo;s farm.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy makes a legitimate point.  This is the reason we introduced exclusions for farms and businesses.  We are trying to encourage the early passing on of businesses and farms to a younger generation.  This has been the policy of the farm organisations for many years and it is the reason they welcomed the five-year rule on when one starts to tick the financial box against a farm or business.  This cannot happen, however, if a person suddenly falls ill at a relatively young age, can no longer run the farm, requires someone else to run it on his or her behalf and needs care.  A person aged 45, 55 or even 60 years cannot reasonably anticipate such an eventuality and an exception has been made for such circumstances.</P>
        <P>On Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s point, the relevant provision has been introduced to ensure the Health Service Executive is able to get its money back through contract law, irrespective of whether the mortgage is secured.  That is not to say the HSE will have a prior claim.  Priority is decided at the time the loan is advanced and registered.  For example, a mortgage on a property will clearly have first priority.  Moneys owed elsewhere that are registered will be the next priority and so forth.  The priority is decided at the point of registration and the HSE claim does not supersede other entitlements.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the scheme is voluntary.  The HSE will advance an interest-free loan, known as the ancillary State support, to pay for care.  It is capped at three years and, in the case of a couple, the maximum payable is 7.5% of the value of the property.  The property&rsquo;s value can be reassessed at any stage if it is in the interests of the care recipient or their representatives <Col N="53"/>to do so and I have no doubt revaluations will occur.  When the legislation was being drafted it was assumed property values would increase, whereas the opposite has occurred.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of amendments were made which related to representatives for applicants of diminished mental capacities.  Section 21 of the Bill provides for the appointment by the Circuit Court of care representatives.  A care representative is required if a person of diminished mental capacity wishes to apply for ancillary State support.  Amendment No. 6 amends section 21 of the Bill.  It obliges the court to have regard to the wishes of the person who is the subject of the application when appointing a care representative.  </P>
        <P>The amendment represents a further safeguard within the scheme for the person.  It is also consistent with the guiding principles contained in the proposed mental capacity legislation.  The reference to &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo; is included so that the proprietor of a nursing home is ruled, on the basis that it would constitute a conflict of interest.  It was decided in the Seanad to add the medical practitioner who did the care assessment for similar reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome these amendments.  They add to the Bill.  It is only right and proper that persons of diminished capacity should still have a say in indicating who they feel  might be best positioned to represent them when they become of that state of mind.  In other words, a person&rsquo;s wishes may have been expressed before he or she was no longer <i>compos mentis</i>.  The definition of &ldquo;<i>compos mentis</i>&rdquo; is to understand the value of one&rsquo;s property, the consequences of one&rsquo;s action and the implications for oneself.  </P>
        <P>Even though a person may not have such understanding, he or she may still have a sense of who is best fit to represent them, given a lengthy relationship over many years before a sad occurrence happens.  I have no issue with the second part.  The Minister is correct and the Seanad was wise to add the term &ldquo;the medical practitioner who has carried out the assessment&rdquo;.  The less room for a conflict of interest the better.  I have no issue with these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments are sensible and we all want to ensure a person would, if possible, have his or her wishes fulfilled.  This is the appropriate way to do it.  It is a good idea to have the medical practitioner as a person whose views can be considered reliable in this regard.  Many people &mdash; Deputy Reilly may not be able to say this because he might be accused of a conflict of interest &mdash; tell their GPs a lot of things they might not tell anybody else.  They open their hearts at times to their GPs.  Registered medical practitioners can include other practitioners.  Often they will be appropriate persons who can best interpret the wishes of the persons concerned.  I have no problem with these amendments. </P>

	<P>The substantive amendment with regard to amendments Nos. 1, 17 and 20 is amendment No. 27.  As the House is aware, when the Bill was first drafted, it contained no mention of homelessness.  It was not until the Bill reached the Seanad that we saw the inclusion of the issue of homelessness.  Amendment No. 27 proposes that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Each housing authority shall establish a process ... within its administrative area for the purposes of developing and implementing a local homeless action plan.  Each local homeless forum shall include approved bodies . . .</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">These are two technical amendments to change the Long Title.  The first changes the Long Title to reflect the fact the earlier amendments in the Bill as published make certain changes to the existing affordable housing schemes and the shared ownership scheme, which have now been superseded by the introduction on Committee Stage of new affordable dwelling purchase arrangements under Part V.  Amendment No. 3 references the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 rather than the Social Welfare Acts as it is the 2005 Act that is being amended.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Deputy John Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State referred to the shared ownership scheme, which is germane, so it might be appropriate at this point to mention the progression of a particular element of housing policy dealt with while this Bill has been making its way through the Oireachtas.  I refer specifically to the long-term leasing arrangements with which the Minister of State and his officials are dealing and which they are finalising for local authorities in Waterford and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>When I spoke on the Bill, I made reference to the 20% social and affordable housing provisions and my strong belief that the measure has been innovative and effective, not just from the standpoint of housing but also from that of social inclusion and integration.  I understand a number of circulars regarding long-term leasehold arrangements between local authorities, voluntary groups and developers are being drafted and finalised.  These measures are timely and demonstrate the necessary flexibility considering the economic times in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, for considering and developing the approach to long-term leasing.  The bottom line is that the money is not available to build units in the traditional manner so we need to figure out alternative methods to finance the construction of local authority housing and, in doing so, start money moving around again in the local economies.  All one need do is look at the Standard and Poor&rsquo;s report that came out yesterday which highlights the stark situation with regard to our housing market.  It is good there has been a development and an extension of the N3 circular that came out late last year or early this year.  The different long-term leasing arrangements being drawn up constitute a significant shift in Government policy.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for considering and adopting these approaches and I look forward to their implementation over the course of the next few months.  I know that view is shared by local authority officers dealing with housing throughout the country.  I also thank the officials for briefing me on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>While we are not dealing directly with this issue, I try to be as open as possible with Deputies and Senators in dealing with the legislation, which will be seen from the number of Government amendments.  I recall that Deputy Deasy during the Second Stage debate indicated his support for a variant of the long-term lease.  I am pleased we are moving in that direction and I have also accepted suggestions from other Deputies.  Deputy Deasy is clearly identified with the proposal in regard to the long-term lease.  We are now considering variants and hopefully, at the end of the day, it will be helpful to the housing authorities throughout the country.  I thank the Deputy for his comments.</P>

The main change is being made to put beyond doubt that the scope of the Act does not extend to owner-occupied leasehold dwellings such as apartment owner-occupiers where the relevant lease is in excess of 35 years.  As matters stand, section 3(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 lists certain dwellings which fall outside the remit of the Act.  That list is exhaustive and cannot be supplemented without legislative amendment.  Therefore, unless a dwelling falls outside the remit of the Act pursuant to section 3(2), the dwelling may be deemed to be an appropriate dwelling under the Act for the purposes of dispute resolution, subject to certain other conditions under the Act being satisfied.</P>
        <P>This could mean, for example, that a dispute over service charges between a management company and an owner-occupier in an apartment block, who also happens to be a leasee, could fall for resolution by the Private Residential Tenancies Board in the same way the normal landlord-tenant disputes do.  Of course, it was never the intention that the Act would have application to owner-occupiers of apartments.  The amendment I propose will put that matter beyond doubt.</P>

	<P>I note that amendment No. 175 at paragraph (5) states: </P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Act of 2004 is amended by inserting the following section after section 147:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">147A.&mdash;The Board [namely, the Private Residential Tenancies Board] shall, at such intervals as are specified by the Revenue Commissioners, disclose to the Revenue Commissioners information contained in the register the disclosure of which to the Revenue Commissioners is reasonably necessary for the performance by the Revenue Commissioners of their functions.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I understand this was proposed by my colleague, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, and was also referred to in a recent parliamentary question to the Minister of State.  If my interpretation of this is correct, it is a welcome addition to the Bill in that it allows for tax compliance and other measures to be carried out between the Revenue Commissioners and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct.  The insertion of the new section 147A into the Residential Tenancies Act gives effect to a recommendation made by the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to taxation of rental income.  It provides for an improved flow of information from the PRTB to the Revenue Commissioners to enable access to the full landlord records held by the PRTB for the purpose of enabling tax compliance checks.  These amendments will take effect immediately on the enactment of the Bill.</P>

I have received representations from organisations on behalf of the disability sector.  The Bill provides a very good opportunity to put in place legislation to give true recognition to the matter of disability.  However, the absence of relevant measures is similar to the absence of addressing homelessness in an earlier draft and it should be corrected at this stage.</P>
        <P>I realise the Minister is in discussions with disability groups but discussions continue on an ongoing basis and one should not draw a line at the end of discussions and suggest they will no longer continue, especially in the area of disability.  The discussions are at a stage at which the amendments proposed are worthy of inclusion in the Bill.  Any further consultation between the Minister of State and such groups may be examined another time and amendments may be put accordingly, as the Minister of State has indicated.  Nevertheless, there is a clear opportunity this afternoon to address a deficiency within the Bill and for disability to be recognised.  I call on the Minister of State to support the amendment.</P>

I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s keen interest in the matter, which reflects my interest in the issue, and his desire to ensure the needs of people with disability are at the heart of support offered by housing authorities.  However, the specific proposals suggested by the Deputy run the risk of pre-empting the important work currently underway to develop a national housing strategy for people with disabilities.  The national advisory group tasked with developing the strategy is due to complete its work by the end of 2009.  As I indicated at the select committee meeting, upon completion of the strategy it may prove necessary to incorporate some of the specific <Col N="61"/>recommendations into law but I do not believe it would be appropriate to do so at this time.

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 11, after line 41, to insert the following:</P>

        <P Just="Center" el="5">&ldquo;PART 2</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">AMENDMENT OF RESIDENTIAL TENANCIES ACT 2004.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">10.&mdash;In this Act, &ldquo;the Principal Act&ldquo; means the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Amendments Nos. 9 to 14, inclusive, relate to significant changes to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated there would be a review of the Residential Tenancies Act and the Private Residential Tenancies Board and that these matters could be examined another time.  The Minister also indicated there was some merit to the series of amendments on Committee Stage as they have been related here.</P>
        <P>In the context of my previous comments to the Minister of State, we have already seen that there will be changes to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 as a result of the Bill.  I believe other changes could be made too and there is no obvious reason why they should not be made.  The series of amendments allow for the creation of a national deposit scheme in which the Residential Tenancies Act would be significantly changed and a national treasury account would be created to establish at least &euro;500,000 in holding deposits of tenants as part of a tenant landlord agreement.  At present, when one hands over a deposit to a landlord there is no legislation governing what takes place to that deposit.  A landlord may lodge it in his or her bank account or credit account.  He or she may keep it in a jam jar or in a biscuit tin at home or may go to a shopping centre to buy a sofa or to Las Vegas if he or she so wishes.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, the money handed over by the tenant belongs to him or her and the landlord only has custody of that money for the duration of the tenancy.  Reports from Threshold and <Col N="62"/>the PRTB show a significant amount of their workload relates to the matter of disputed deposits.  These amendments create a clear mechanism to ensure such disputes are dealt with in a speedy fashion.  The PRTB will come before the an Oireachtas committee next week and to discuss the 18 month backlog of disputes.  The cost of this backlog is approximately between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per day.  There would be an immediate saving to the State by simply clearing the backlog.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, in answer to a parliamentary question the Minister stated there are in excess of 200,000 private residential tenancies registered with the PRTB.  I believe more exist which are not registered.  However, if we tied the registration process to the holding and safekeeping of a deposit, it would create greater and more far-reaching compliance with the PRTB registration process.  It would also provide protection for tenants and their deposits.  It would create a significant amount of money for the State and approximately half a billion euro could be held on account as a result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the amendments were carried there would also be a direct saving for the State because there are approximately 80,000 rental allowance contracts.  Community welfare officers hand over money to a landlord on behalf of a tenant for which everyone in the State pays.  The amendments create the possibility for that sum to be notionally lodged with a treasury account.  If there is a breach of the tenancy agreement, the landlord can avail of the deposit but, most importantly, the State need not outlay the money in the first instance.  By a modest reckoning if the amendment were agreed to it would create an immediate saving of approximately &euro;80 million for the State.  I realise some &euro;35 billion is involved in NAMA and so on but &euro;80 million remains a significant sum by any account.  Any legislation that generates such a saving for the Exchequer should not be ridiculed.</P>
        <P>Much work has gone into these amendments.  They also consider deposits which operate in the voluntary and housing co-operative sectors.  I call on the Minister to accept the amendments.  They do not set any precedents.  Although they may represent new legislation in Ireland other countries in Europe and elsewhere in the western hemisphere have such measures as a standard practice in tenancy agreements.</P>
 </Speaker>
 <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Although not specifically related to the amendment, my point related to deposits in general.  There have been reports in the media about deposits for new apartments which, unfortunately, were never built.  It relates to the homebond guarantee which is only valid for two years.  I ask the Minister of State to review that situation.</P>

However, my Department is currently progressing a review of the Residential Tenancies Act and I have asked my officials to consider Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s proposals in the context of that review. </P>

I do not see any reason for not accepting this amendment even with the current review.  I will be pressing the amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The purpose of amendments Nos. 15 and 29 is to ensure adequate provision for promoting the independence of persons with a disability.  The Bill goes some way to rectifying situations where significant sums of money are spent on the disabled persons grant scheme.  The Bill will now facilitate a clawback for moneys expended in that area.  The issue of dealing with disability in the area of housing should not be to create a segregated approach nor should it mean the creation of modifications to mainstream housing.  The amendment proposes that as part of housing planning, there would be integration of housing programmes for people with disabilities into mainstream housing developments so that such persons would have an independent living arrangement within the housing programme.  I will be pressing the amendment and I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P>I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether a regulation exists that all newly built houses must provide wheelchair access.  I understand there is such a regulation but it is honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  Many new houses, either one-off houses or houses in estates, have inadequate wheelchair access.  Have penalties been imposed on developers or those building one-off houses when they are not making necessary provision for wheelchair access?  In some cases I have seen beautiful ramps up to front doors and then two steps to get into the house which renders the ramp useless.  What is the regulation in this regard? </P>

	<P>What penalty exists where that condition is not met?  Is it solely a matter for the planning authority to say that it is unauthorised development? Is this matter followed up when it occurs?  It is a matter which inconveniences wheelchair-users and drives them crazy that this regulation is not being enforced. It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say it is a matter for the planning authority if it was a condition of the planning permission that wheelchair access should be provided.  Has the Department any regulation in place?  I have recently seen a number of planning applications where there is no condition about wheelchair access.  If it is a requirement for the planning authorities they are not putting it in their conditions for granting planning permissions. </P>

	<P>This legislation places considerable demands on housing authorities in terms of strategic planning through the development of housing service plans and housing action programmes.  The making of rent and allocation schemes, statutory requirements on anti-social behaviour strategies and homelessness action plans and new purchase schemes in the form of incremental purchase, tenant purchase of apartments and affordable dwelling purchase arrangements.  I am making statutory provision for these and other areas because they will provide a modern and efficient framework to assist housing authorities in meeting their housing responsibilities.  However, I recognise that their implementation will be onerous.  I do not propose to accept the amendment No. 15a proposed by the Deputy which would add unnecessarily to the workload without any obvious benefit.  I am satisfied with the review provisions set out in section 17 which will provide sufficient flexibility in this area which the Deputy wishes to delete by way of an amendment No. 26a.

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) Where the proposals submitted by bodies referred to in <i>subsection (1) </i>are not incorporated into the housing services plan, the housing authority shall furnish outline reasons for not incorporating those proposals.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>When proposals are invited by an agency acting on the public&rsquo;s behalf, the proposals are listed and the agency may find it agrees with some of the proposals while disagreeing with others.  The amendment places a responsibility on a statutory agency, in this case a local authority, when it disagrees with a submission to outline its reasons for doing so.  This requirement goes beyond good manners.  It places a level of accountability on local authorities to read reports and to give a clear position as to why suggestions are not being adopted.</P>
        <P>Under the Part 8 structure, reports are already done in that way.  The pros and cons are thrashed out, summarised and included in a copy of the report so that local public representatives can inform themselves before they vote on the report in the council chamber.  I have come across Part 8 proposals with which local officials may have disagreed but whose validity was upheld in the council chamber.  This amendment is a model of good practice in how to consult with the public and how local government should interact with the general public.  I ask the Minister of State to accept it.</P>

	<P>The addition of a statutory requirement on a housing authority to supply explanations for the reasons it might have for not fully taking on board proposals submitted during consultation on a housing services plan would not be appropriate.  It would not serve any useful purpose in this instance.</P>
        <P>It is important to strike the right balance between ensuring transparency in the forward planning processes of housing authorities and giving authorities the appropriate powers to do that effectively.  The Bill as it stands strikes that balance and I do not propose to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment in the interests of openness and transparency.  To notify the public of its deliberations in this regard is the least a local authority <Col N="70"/>should do.  This stands to reason and I do not know why the Minister of State is not accepting the amendment.  It seems to me to be common sense that a local authority would be obliged to give its reasons to the bodies concerned.  I do no think it would harm anyone if the amendment were accepted.  It would copperfasten the requirement for local authorities to give explanations for their deliberations. </P>

	<P>It is the role of a housing authority to plan ahead for the provision of housing supports in its administrative area.  I assume we all agree on that.</P>
        <P>While we must provide for the maximum transparency in the strategic planning process and seek an input into the wider range of important issues and voices in the housing area, we must be also careful not to erode or over complicate the ability of a housing authority to plan ahead.</P>
        <P>The important characteristic of this provision is that it will be undertaken in a public way and with appropriate consultation.  There will be executive assessment by the manager and debate and adoption by elected members of the council.  The Minister may for stated reasons require the housing authority to amend the draft plan so that the adopted plan takes full account of the matter specified in section 15.  The adoption plan must be made available for public inspection, including on the Internet.  In those circumstances, I ask Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch to withdraw his amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment defines &ldquo;homeless person&rdquo;.  At the risk of sounding repetitive, the absence of homelessness from the original Bill has almost become folklore.  In fairness to the Minister of State, the guard has changed since the Bill was first published and as a result homelessness has been included.  I commend him on taking on board the views of homeless groups and engaging with the MakeRoom campaign.  However, while he has made amendments to the Bill following these consultations he has not remedied certain omissions.</P>
        <P>I concur with the assertions of the MakeRoom campaign and homeless agencies that any strategy aimed at eliminating homelessness will have to begin by setting out a definition in legislation.  It would be a glaring omission if we failed to define homelessness because local authorities will refer to the Bill.  Local authority members are regularly faced with disputed figures on the numbers of homeless people in various parts of the country.  My amendment would rectify that problem.  As well as counting people who are living on the streets or in temporary arrangements, it offers a framework for eradicating homelessness.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>While I would welcome a clear definition of &ldquo;homeless person&rdquo; I am not sure if we should accept all the definitions proposed in amendment No. 32.  What is the current definition of &ldquo;homeless person&rdquo;?  Does it merely mean a person who sleeps in a night shelter or on the street?  Within a half mile of Leinster House one can see ten or 15 people asleep in doorways and other locations.  Is a register kept of homeless people?  We should be careful in adopting legislation which gives an overly broad definition of homelessness. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment No. 33 is similar to amendment No. 32 and I am inclined to withdraw it in favour of that proposed by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch.  His amendment includes a number of additional definitions which I think would enhance the Bill.  It is important that we define &ldquo;homeless person&rdquo;.  While the Housing Act 1998 provided the earliest legal definition of homelessness, it was overly restrictive and did not place a legal obligation on local authorities to provide services for the homeless.</P>
        <P>The definition of homelessness developed by the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless, FEANTSA, must be included in our legislation in order to comply with human rights.  This is the purpose of my amendment and amendment No. 32.  A home-based definition is required which classifies homeless people according to their life <Col N="73"/>situations.  Such a definition should include rough sleepers, people who are threatened with eviction or suffering domestic violence and those who occupy inadequate housing.  An inclusive definition would protect the most vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P>I welcome the intervention by MakeRoom and wonder why the Government is reluctant to include a definition in the Bill.  Some local authorities set good examples on dealing with homelessness but others have failed in their duties.  Even the best authorities, however, cannot address the shortage of housing without adequate resources.  I am aware of one family with four children in Dublin who have been on the homeless list for more than three years.  They have lived in bed and breakfasts and temporary accommodation while the local authority&rsquo;s homeless section decided on their fate.  That sort of insecurity is not good for the family, the local authority or society in general because it can lead to further problems.  In the recent past, large numbers of people appeared to be sleeping rough in the Phoenix Park.  There appear to be increasing numbers of people sleeping in doorways in this city.  It will be interesting to learn, when the local authority statistics are compiled, how many people are sleeping rough.  While this problem was being addressed there has been, as a result of the economic downturn, an increase in the number of people sleeping in cars and doorways and illegally occupying land and squats.  Let us not forget this is happening at a time when a vast amount of new accommodation remains idle.  It is important a definition of homelessness is provided and that from that definition flow the resources and duties required of us as a society, and of the local authority, to provide homeless persons with a roof over their heads, thus ensuring no person is homeless.</P>
        <P>The key line missing from my amendment but included in Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s amendment is &ldquo;a person who has had to leave or cannot remain in their home due to domestic violence&rdquo;.  I regret there appears to be an increase in domestic violence and a growth of abuse in society.  We must ensure that people facing that type of threat on a daily basis are given the opportunity to escape such circumstances.  They must receive a classification which allows them to be properly and adequately housed elsewhere.  I believe the definition will be enhanced by the inclusion of that provision.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to accept this provision thus ensuring that a person homeless by reason of domestic violence is eligible for priority housing and does not end up languishing in a refuge for months or years before the local authority is compelled to act to house or rehouse him or her.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is often said that a Government is judged on how it deals with the most vulnerable people in society.  Clearly, the fact that the problem of homelessness was not dealt with during the Celtic tiger years makes it more difficult to remedy the situation now.  </P>
        <P>I commend the MakeRoom campaign which has lobbied me and other spokespersons on this issue in terms of getting the Government to accept a clearer definition of homelessness.  Perhaps the Minister of State will say with what part of the definitions put forward by Deputies Lynch and &Oacute; Snodaigh he is unhappy.  I commend the Minister of State on his personal interest in tackling the homelessness issue, on his vision to eliminate homelessness by 2010 and the fact that he has accepted this is an issue requiring to be tackled in this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies who have acknowledged the work we have been doing through the homeless strategy, which I launched in August 2008 and which has been a work in progress since then.  </P>
        <P>On amendments Nos. 32 and 33, we discussed Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s amendment in some detail on Committee Stage.  The amendment proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in seeks to provide a new statutory definition of homelessness.  I outlined to the select committee the practical actions being taken by my Department and local authorities to alleviate the difficulties of homeless people and to <Col N="74"/>provide a consistent basis for practical implementation of the existing definition of homelessness across all local authority areas.</P>
        <P>In addition, work is currently being undertaken by the homeless agency, in partnership with the Centre for Housing Research, to develop a position paper on the application of a statutory definition for the Dublin area.  This paper will input into the review to be taken to the cross-departmental team on homelessness in consultation with the National Homeless Consultative Committee.  In that context, the Government has decided the existing definition is adequate and does not require updating.</P>
        <P>For the benefit of the House, the existing definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; as contained in section 2 of the Housing Act 1988 defines a person as homeless if (<i>a</i>) there is no accommodation available, which in the opinion of the authority, he or she, together with any other person who resides with him or her or who might reasonably be expected to reside with him or her, can reasonably occupy or remain in occupation of or, (<i>b</i>) he or she is living in a hospital, county home, night shelter or other such institution, and is so living because he or she has no accommodation of the kind referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>) and he or she is, in the opinion of the authority, unable to provide accommodation from his or her own resources.  Generally, the definition is interpreted as including persons living in temporary or insecure accommodation, people living in emergency bed and breakfast accommodation, hostels or HSE accommodation because they have no other accommodation available to them.  Rough sleepers are also included in that category as are victims of family or domestic violence.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that a review is under way to see how the definition of homelessness is being applied operationally and to ensure it is applied consistently across all local authorities.  We have been proactive in the homeless area.  Also, I should point out for the benefit of the House that there has been in recent times a decrease of 41%, down from 185 to 110, in the number of people sleeping rough.  A particular aim of the homeless strategy, which it is hoped will be implemented, is that nobody will remain in emergency accommodation, such as bed and breakfast accommodation, for more than six months.  That is one of the three main aims of the homeless strategy.  I do not intend to accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Much of what the Minister of State has stated in his reply is dependent on the interpretation of the provisions by one housing official as compared with another.  One often finds that one has to argue a case on behalf of a constituent.  I maintain that a person who can readily show there is not available to him or her a bedroom for sleeping should be included in the homeless category.  I have come across a couple of people who were forced out of rented accommodation for one reason or another.  I know of a mother with three children all of whom sleep in a living room because every other room in the House is full owing to the size of the family.  They are unable to go to sleep until everybody has gone to bed and as such should be categorised as homeless.  The alternative is for them to sleep in the street, thus qualifying as homeless persons.  This mother and three children should be treated as a special category.  The fact that a person living in a hostel can be regarded as a homeless person and that a mother with three children who is forced to sleep in a living room is not regarded as homeless appears peculiar.   </P>
        <P>If the Minister of State is unable to accept the amendments I would ask that he consider issuing guidelines to local authorities that are consistent with each local authority and to ensure it is not left to individual officers to decide whether a person should be on a homeless list.  We need consistency among the local authorities.  It should be a policy in each of the housing areas.</P>
        <P>I am sorry I was late but there is one more point I wish to make.  Section 18(3) states: &ldquo;The manager shall provide a copy of the housing action programme to the Minister, the members <Col N="75"/>of the housing authority and the members of any borough council or town council situated in the administrative area of the housing authority.&rdquo;  I believe a Member of the Oireachtas should be included in this.  This applies to other sections of the Bill as well.  People come to Members of the Oireachtas who, because the dual mandate has disappeared, may be totally unaware of changes that were made by way of regulation and so on.  They should be informed automatically.  The section is correct in that it is an attempt to keep public representatives informed, but it should automatically include Members of the Oireachtas in view of the fact that the dual mandate is no longer in existence.</P>

	<P>It is a pity the Minister cannot find it in himself to consider the points included in this amendment.  I still do not understand the reluctance to enhance the existing definition by accepting the definition of a homeless person.  The definition as presented is adequate and this is an important issue.  I welcome the practical actions being taken by the Department and local authorities in addressing homelessness.  I hope the figures for those sleeping rough announced by the Minister are borne out over the next number of months.  It might be anecdotal, but from what I have seen there seems to have been an increase.  However, it may just be that there is a greater concentration in certain areas.</P>
        <P>This era of recession is a challenge to everyone but particularly to those who are most vulnerable in our society.  We should ensure we put in place the necessary protections for people who end up homeless and ensure that they have priority service from the local housing authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Barrett, I cannot deal with that matter under this amendment.  On the issue of homelessness, rather than getting bogged down in the semantics of how homelessness is defined, providing a consistent basis for the practical implementation of the definition across local authority areas is a more meaningful approach in terms of delivering the necessary supports for homeless people.  We have made it clear in the homeless strategy and in the course of our engagement with representatives of service providers in the MakeRoom alliance that we will be reviewing the application of the definition.  I have outlined my reasons for not accepting the amendments and on that basis I ask the Deputies to withdraw them. </P>

	<P>I thank the other Members for their contributions.  In response to Deputy Barrett&rsquo;s comments, we are on Report Stage and there is no other chance to table an amendment, so perhaps the Minister might instruct local authority managers by means of a directive to ensure that the circular is issued to Oireachtas Members.</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P>There are a number of points to be addressed, but the critical one is this: if we do not have a definition for a problem, how do we know when we have solved it?  It is a goal shared by everybody on all sides of the House to eradicate the problem of homelessness rather than merely dealing with it.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, the inclusion of a reference to domestic violence in the definition of homelessness arises from the enactment of the Domestic Violence Act 1996.  The development of this Act was on one simple premise &mdash; that we must have a definition of domestic violence &mdash; and out of that definition of domestic violence a whole series of new legislation was created.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s response that the existing definition as included in the legislation is inadequate.  A series of reviews of this legislation seem to be taking place concurrently, but the place for reviews is in legislation.  I do not know when we will see another Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill before the House &mdash; it could be in a couple of months&rsquo; time or in a couple of years &mdash; so now is the opportune moment to deal with it.  The amendment was drawn up in consultation with the MakeRoom campaign and the stakeholders have been included.  It is not simply that the amendment is acceptable; it deserves to be included in the Bill.  Thus, I am pressing the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 25, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(18) Before making or amending an allocation scheme, a housing authority shall provide a draft of the scheme or amendment to the scheme to housing authorities, voluntary sector housing and homeless service providers and other relevant bodies, who may respond to the proposed scheme or amendment to the scheme.  The housing authority may amend the proposed scheme or amendment to the scheme.  If the housing authority chooses not to amend the proposed scheme or amendment to the scheme they must explain the reasons in writing to the housing authority, voluntary sector provider of housing or homeless services or other relevant body if requested.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This relates to an earlier amendment of mine.  There is an obligation on local authorities not only to communicate correspondence to other partners in the area of social housing but to provide explanations of any submissions made.  Instead of simply being presented with a finished product, there must be a draft process whereby the allocation scheme and how it is structured, if it is to be changed, can be examined by the relevant agencies and further submissions made where appropriate.  It is a question of good local government practice.</P>
        <P>If one can go so far as to describe it as a positive opportunity, the reduction in house prices has created a situation where we can look more creatively at housing strategies into the future, notwithstanding the possibility that local authorities may no longer have the resources to develop housing strategies.  What is required is a dynamic between all the partners engaged in the housing sector, including homeless, voluntary and co-operative housing programmes.  There must be a mechanism whereby other stakeholders can make a contribution at draft stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  The bodies referred to in the amendment should not be kept in the dark regarding proposed amendments to a housing allocation <Col N="79"/>scheme.  Deputy Barrett made the point earlier that Oireachtas Members should also be notified of any amendments.  Local authorities seem to treat Members as second class public representative simply because we do not attend council meetings and cannot take officials to task face-to-face or in the presence of the press.  All public representatives, including Oireachtas Members, should be notified of any amendments to housing allocation schemes.  It makes no sense that the bodies referred to in this amendment are not automatically notified of proposed draft amendments.  It is only logical that they would and should have an input into any changes. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important amendment.  I have been trying for some time to encourage the Minister to deal with the various allocation schemes and schemes of lettings.  For example, Dublin City Council has submitted a draft to the Minister and it has gone back and forth for some time.  There must be scope for discussion in order to ensure these schemes are fit for purpose.  That is what the amendment seeks to do.  It makes sense that those bodies working at the coalface and which have an understanding of the process should have an opportunity to offer advice.  All that is required is that the draft be circulated.  I agree with Deputy McCormack that Oireachtas Members should also be included in the process.  However, what is most important is that those bodies in the voluntary sector, including NABCo, Cl&uacute;id and so on, understand the types of schemes the local authority is operating and can ascertain whether there are any implications for their own operations.  This is a reasonable and not particularly onerous proposal.  A timeframe can be imposed in order to ensure there is no undue delay between draft and completion of an allocation scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The making of an allocation scheme is a reserved function of the elected members of the housing authority.  As such, it is a matter for those members to agree the terms of the allocation scheme in accordance with the legislative framework set out in the section.  I do not intend to interfere with that.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody disputes that it is a matter for the elected members to adopt a housing allocation scheme.  However, when the draft of a scheme is introduced or amendments are proposed at draft stage, there is nothing wrong in seeking representations or submissions from the bodies referred to in this amendment.  In the case of county or city development plans, for instance, drafts must be made available to all interested parties before elected members adopt the scheme.  It would not in any way interfere with the rights and responsibilities of elected members if the draft of a housing scheme were to be made available to various bodies, including the Oireachtas, so that there is an opportunity to make submissions before the elected members ultimately adopt the allocation regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the allocation scheme, if it is a reserved function, why does it end up going to the Minister?  Obviously, the Minister gets to insert his or her tuppence worth.  We are seeking to ensure the other stakeholders in this have some say or can give advice before the local authority members and the city or county manager have the final say in the scheme. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s resistance to accepting this amendment appears to be based on whether it is a reserved or executive function.  Ultimately, the general public, stakeholders and agencies that deal with local authorities, be it the officials or public representatives, deserve the same quality and type of approach.  Consultations should take place with public representatives as much as with staff in the city or county hall.  The Minister, in discriminating between one as executive and the other as reserved, is not putting up a strong enough case to reject the amendment. The objective of the amendment is to provide for good practice guide<Col N="80"/>lines.  There should be such guidelines for elected representatives and full-time officials of local authorities. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The housing authority is the body with overall responsibility for the delivery of the housing programme, specifically with regard to assessments and allocations.  The authority will undertake the assessment of need in accordance with the new arrangements to be set out in regulations.  It seems appropriate that it would have full responsibility for making an allocation scheme for determining the order of priority for allocation of dwellings.  An allocation scheme will be a public document.  The amendment was considered and rejected by the select committee and I do not propose to accept it now.</P>

The type of assistance envisaged is support services to assist formerly homeless tenants to sustain and continue their tenancies and supports generally to assist tenants of local authority owned dwellings.

	<P>This is probably the only success I will achieve this afternoon so I might as well make the most of it.  Every day I spend in the House I am usually surprised and boggled.  When I moved the amendment on Committee Stage, it was abundantly clear it was a technical amendment.  I do not know what the procedures are in minute detail but I am learning them as I spend more time in the House.  There was a glaring mistake in the Bill.  A date was misplaced and I cannot understand why it could not simply have been corrected on Committee Stage.  Obviously, there are certain procedures and blockages, but in the wider debate on D&aacute;il reform this is a classic example of how it could reform.  Although a mistake was obvious and could be rectified there and then, it was necessary to go from Committee Stage to this Stage for &ldquo;2007&rdquo; to be removed from the Bill and &ldquo;2008&rdquo; to be inserted.  The amount of work that had to be done again on Report Stage to rectify this defies belief.  It is bewildering.

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) the taking of rapid and effective action to terminate the tenancy of any household where a member or members of that household have engaged in anti-social behaviour,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Anti-social behaviour in society generally, and in local authority housing estates, has become a plague of modern living to such an extent that facilities which in other countries would be seen as of benefit to a local community have now become a considerable burden for those communities.  These include facilities such as a public park, an alley way, a grove or a woodland area that should add value not only to cost of people&rsquo;s homes but also to the quality of life in local communities.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State proposes to introduce measures in the Bill to combat anti-social behaviour in local authority estates.  When examined, however, those measures do nothing other than add further bureaucratic duties to local authority staff.</P>
        <P>I propose actions that local authorities can take.  These will not only create a local anti-social behaviour strategy for which an anti-social behaviour officer must tick off boxes but when that officer comes across such behaviour he or she will be able to take meaningful and direct action.  I ask the Minister of State to support amendment No. 62 and the House to adopt it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Anti-social behaviour causes grave concern in certain cases.  Many neighbours feel helpless in this regard and this amendment would certainly strengthen the possibility of achieving something concrete to deal with anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>The situation can arise in local authority or other housing estates where neighbours are forced to move out because of anti-social behaviour rather the problems that affect neighbours being tackled.  These matters can start very simply, among siblings of neighbours, with corrections or disputes in playgrounds.  They build up to become a major problem for households when instead there should be a system of tackling them from the beginning by liaison officers, housing support agencies or agencies such as those mentioned in the amendment.  These would be in a position to nip the behaviour in the bud before it develops into a major confrontation which destroys the lives, not only of those who engage in such behaviour, but also of their neighbours.  Anti-social behaviour has a complete and absolute effect on the community and gives it a bad name.  People say then that they would not take a house in estate X, Y or Z because there was anti-social behaviour going on and they would not like to live there.  Others seek transfers out of such areas because of the anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>The issue extends further.  I do not know whether anything can be done about this but I raised the matter on Committee Stage.  Is there any recourse for the local authority where anti-social behaviour can be proved beyond doubt and when the authority has investigated it?  Eventually a tenant can be evicted for anti-social behaviour but by the time that stage is reached so much harm has been done that the problem is not resolved.  Another person is made homeless and there will be repercussions against the person who reported the behaviour.  If those situations could be tackled from the beginning it would be to the benefit of everybody in the estate as well as for neighbours.</P>
        <P>There are also cases of anti-social behaviour among people on rent supplements in private estates.  They receive taxpayers&rsquo; money to pay their rent and if they engage in anti-social behaviour, the HSE, which supplies them with the rent supplement, has no recourse of any kind.  It cannot evict anybody.  I might ring up the HSE and report that in such and such a house the tenant on rent supplement is reported to be responsible for anti-social behaviour.  I might ask for the situation to be investigated but I will be told the HSE can do nothing about it.  It claims it neither evicts anybody nor stops the rent supplement, that it is not the business of the HSE but a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Once the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is brought in, the job will be finished in any case because there will be no chance of reconciliation between neighbours if that happens.</P>
        <P>However, let us consider a system whereby the health authority is able to investigate the anti-social behaviour and, if the matter is proved, can stop rent supplement for a fortnight or three weeks.  The landlord would not be long coming then to sort out the anti-social behaviour if his rent were to be stopped for that period.  At present, the landlord does not give a damn.  He or she may live in another part of the country, or Europe, or the world and has no notion whatsoever of sorting out the anti-social behaviour as long as the rent arrives every week and the HSE continues to pay the rent supplement.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State cannot do anything about that in this Bill but it must be looked into at some stage.  That type of anti-social behaviour must be tackled in situations where taxpayers&rsquo; money is involved in paying the majority of the rent for the house in question.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State.  This amendment may help to sort out anti-social behaviour at the beginning, which is the important time to tackle such behaviour.  Amendment No. 62 and the subsequent amendments we are considering cry out for action to sort the matter out, to liaise with tenants and neighbours who start out by having small differences, such as &ldquo;My Johnny hit your Rosie coming home from school&rdquo; type of incident.  Next, the parents are <Col N="85"/>involved and then it becomes an unstoppable avalanche, a rolling snowball that cannot be stopped.  Simple intervention at the beginning would eliminate much anti-social behaviour and the causes or perceived causes of injustices practised by one neighbour on another.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and gangsterism.  As Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch stated, there is no strategy to address the problem.  We need action.  People should behave in a normal and reasonable way.  Someone might turn music up too loud the odd time or upset people with a party, but these things happen and are not consistent.  Sometimes, all one needs to do is look at a house to know.  A local authority house costs a great deal of money, yet it could be in tatters and loud music could be coming from it.  Drug dealing could be destroying other families in the estate.  Children might not be allowed out because of intimidation.</P>
        <P>A signed tenancy agreement is a legal document.  The matter should be addressed in this respect.  The agreements should be changed to oblige people to behave in a normal and reasonable way.  I am not saying that someone cannot open his or her mouth.  Everyone living next door to anti-social behaviour knows what it is.  People attending our clinics are fearful due to intimidation.  Telling them to put their complaints in writing to a local authority is all very well, but the average person wants to live a quiet life and is afraid to make a written complaint.  A housing inspector should knock on the offenders&rsquo; doors and warn them that, if they do not adhere to the tenancy agreements that they signed, tidy their front gardens, remove all of the rubbish and stop being nuisances to the area, action will be taken.  If there is no improvement, the authorities should go to court to get eviction orders.</P>
        <P>Why should the majority of decent, ordinary people live with such horror every day of the week?  Transferring the offenders from one estate to another would do no good because they would just continue acting in the same way.  People must know that they are subject to rules and regulations.  It should be pointed out to them when they sign their tenancy agreements that these are conditions with which they must comply, not aspirations.</P>
        <P>No housing authority will devise a strategy to address anti-social behaviour.  The tenancy agreement should be the strategy and outline what one can and cannot do in a local authority house rented from the taxpayer.  It is only fair and proper that ordinary, decent people who want to live their lives properly should not need to put up with what is, in many cases, gangsterism.  Such behaviour has previously led to flying squads threatening people and taking the law into their own hands.  That is not the way to solve this problem either.</P>
        <P>I ask that the House consider this matter seriously, as it is one issue in which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as the housing supremo, should insist <Col N="86"/>on the wording of tenancy agreements.  Likewise, it should insist that local authorities adhere to agreements and take action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers.  There have been instances of appalling intimidation of ordinary, law-abiding citizens.  They mind their houses and comply with every rule and regulation but are intimidated at every turn and have their houses stoned and egged and their windows broken.  Crowds of gougers sit on walls throughout the night and intimidate people, including small children, womenfolk and the elderly.  Many people who have lived in those estates all of their lives have left because they could not stick the situation any longer.</P>
        <P>It is a sad reflection on society that we seem incapable of doing anything about this.  I wish to put on record the types of action available for use.  For example, a local authority can take action through a tenant liaison officer, but nothing ever occurs.  Some estates in my constituency are virtually derelict.  Like a virus, anti-social behaviour spreads from one end of an estate to the other.  When the gougers realise that they can get away with it, they continue.</P>
        <P>Deputy McCormack raised a question on private rented houses.  The law exists in that respect and action can be taken through the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.  For example, rent support can and has been withdrawn.  The HSE has always been reluctant to withdraw rent support, but I assure the House that it has done so more than once in the face of stiff resistance.  However, there is the rule of law and no one should need to put up with the antics of lunatic neighbours simply because a State institution pays the neighbours&rsquo; rent.  That would be crazy.</P>
        <P>We must recognise the fact that anti-social behaviour is no longer restricted to local authority areas.  It just so happens that those areas are the ones over which the Department and local authorities have most control.  There is an emerging absolute disregard for the property of others, any kind of authority and anyone who is weaker, smaller, younger or older than the perpetrators.  I do not know what can be done.  Unless it is done soon, however, a serious issue will arise and evoke a serious reaction from ordinary, law-abiding citizens.  Anti-social behaviour is appalling.  Incidentally, the Department is paying for major refurbishment programmes to repair the wanton damage done by people who could not care less.</P>
        <P>I support these well-placed amendments.  However, discussing the issue is of no benefit unless we do something about it.  The PRTB can take action in respect of private rented property and the HSE is bound to withdraw rent support if a complaint is valid.  The Minister of State must respond in some fashion to the antics of those who want to take over local authority housing estates to pursue their own lawlessness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with amendment No. 62.  Hopefully, the genius who changed the screens so that we can no longer read the amendment numbers might fix the problem through D&aacute;il reform.  I missed my previous amendment, No. 61, because of it, but the amendments under discussion address the same issues, namely, anti-social behaviour and the rights and wrongs of local authorities in that respect.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch&rsquo;s amendment No. 62 because a rapid system of action is necessary after the normal system of checks and balances has been used.  Eviction is to be used as a last resort after preventative and other interim processes, such as warning letters, interviews and case conferences, have been exhausted.  It is a question of proportionality.  The rapid system must not be used as a punishment.  There must be a remedy, otherwise people will <Col N="87"/>become homeless.  While this will be through their own fault, society will need to address the problem.</P>
        <P>Other jurisdictions use different schemes and we must consider how to take the best of what they do.  The local authority in Glasgow made a presentation about what it does to address persistent anti-social behaviour.  The family in question will be moved to a separate location and work will be done with them for a number of months until the problems are addressed.</P>
        <P>Other Deputies have addressed the problems that can arise in detail.  I could go on and on about incidents in private and public housing in my area, such as Dolphin&rsquo;s Barn and Rialto, which have been in the news for all the wrong reasons recently.  There are even private landlords who are trying to address anti-social elements.  The fact that rent supplement is not always paid to the landlord but to tenants can make landlords fearful they will lose the rent if they move against those tenants or challenge them.</P>
        <P>There is a reluctance in some areas to allow social housing because of the reputation of some estates.  The RAS scheme, where a landlord decides to take local authority tenants, often involves private estates where in the past local authorities might have bought houses.</P>
        <P>This whole area also deals with voluntary housing schemes and how they address anti-social behaviour.  The rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords must be spelled out.  Potentially one or two bad tenants can bring down an entire area so we must ensure the proper supports exist for the local authority to address this.  If there is drug dealing, it is a matter for the garda&iacute; and requires additional support.</P>
        <P>Some of the problems can been addressed through extra resources for the local authority.  In my area in some houses they were breeding vicious dogs.  No one knew about it because the neighbours were not saying anything.  Eventually the local estate management officers were informed and they acted quickly because the matter was covered by the tenancy agreement.  The problem then arose that the family reacted against the neighbours who they presumed were the ones who &ldquo;squealed&rdquo; on them.  It was not the neighbours, it was someone else who was concerned about animal welfare.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of tenants on drugs or who are drunk who destroy the property and then expect the local authority to fix it.  That cannot continue.  Even if the tenant is evicted, there is a huge loss to the local authority because it must spend time and money doing up that house.  There are persistent offenders, with threats, robberies, joy riding, intimidation and even prostitution in some of these houses.</P>
        <P>The promotion of good estate management is of vital importance and measures to address anti-social behaviour are key.  It is important that local authorities are seen to take the sort of rapid and effective action that is called for in this amendment.  If it does not happen it discourages other tenants from coming forward with information about abuse of the property of the people, paid for through their taxes.  If they do not see any response from the local authority or garda&iacute;, they will do what many people are doing, they will keep their heads down, say it is nothing to do with them and hope the matter will go away.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to consider the amendments dealing with anti-social behaviour.  They are intended to ensure local authorities are not handcuffed but that they are free to deal with the issue as effectively as possible within the confines of human rights legislation.  Other tenants and neighbours, however, also have rights.  There are duties incumbent on local authorities as landlords and rights and responsibilities for tenants.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage there was a detailed discussion of issues relating to anti-social behaviour.  Today we have seen again that many Deputies have contributed because there are always strong feelings about this issue.</P>
        <P>Section 35 of the Bill contains significant provision to strengthen existing powers to tackle anti-social behaviour, including the introduction of anti-social behaviour strategies by housing authorities to provide for co-operation between bodies, procedures for the making of complaints, initiatives for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour and other amendments to the 1997 Act.</P>
        <P>I outlined to the committee why certain Opposition amendments were inappropriate and unnecessary and why it has not been possible to bring forward further amendments in this area due to legal proceedings that are currently underway.  These arguments continue to apply and I do not propose to accept any of the amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the State and the local authorities well in those cases because if the worst happens much of the good work done by local authorities will be lost.  We have prepared legislation before to deal with what might arise in the event of a court case.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure if the courts find against a local authority that emergency legislation is in place in order that the whole tenancy agreement system is not put at risk by an adverse court decision.  Even without waiting for an adverse decision we should prepare more robust legislation to ensure that whatever happens in the court, even if it is favourable, local authorities have additional powers to address anti-social behaviour at all levels.</P>

It inserts into the incremental purchase suspension process a mechanism for resolving disputes between a purchaser and housing authority or approved body over the market value of a dwelling similar to that in place in section 48 with regard to the resale of dwellings during the charge period.  It provides that in such a dispute the purchaser can nominate an independent valuer from the panel of valuers established by the housing authority to determine the market value of the dwelling.

	<P>I move amendment No. 109:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 70, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(3) The Minister may by directive provide for a discount on the sale price of an apartment under this section where the sale is to a tenant who has been recorded by the council concerned as having requested the option of purchasing the apartment prior to the com<Col N="99"/>mencement of this section but who has been precluded from doing so by the absence of legislative provision in that behalf.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The purpose of the amendment is to bring to a positive conclusion a long-standing problem by correcting an unjust and unfair anomaly affecting a specific group of local authority tenants.  I first encountered the problem in 1992 while knocking on doors in the Ballyphehane area of Cork.  A lady explained to me that she was prohibited from buying her home because it was a flat, whereas local authority tenants living in houses were able to purchase their homes.  On my election to Cork City Council, I pursued the matter and quickly discovered that the problem did not reside with the council but with national legislation prohibiting certain council tenants from purchasing their homes.</P>
        <P>In the intervening years, Deputy Kathleen Lynch and I and many others have sought to have legislation introduced to afford council tenants living in flats the right to buy their homes.  A long time has passed &mdash; the Celtic tiger has come and gone, a property bubble has burst and the economy has fundamentally changed &mdash; and those who sought to buy their homes in the past have grown older and their financial circumstances have changed.  The age profile of many of them prevents them from acquiring a mortgage because the minimum term of mortgages under standard arrangements is 20 years.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposes to give tangible recognition to the campaign waged by tenants affected by the prohibition.  I accept the legislation solves the overall problem by providing for the establishment of a legislative framework enabling tenants to purchase local authority flats.  The Minister of State and his officials have done considerable work on the issue, as have other parties who were included in the design process for the new mechanism.  Notwithstanding their efforts, however, under this legislation tenants who have been waiting for ten years or more to purchase their homes will pay exactly the same price as all other tenants who avail of the scheme.  This provision is unfair and it is unfortunate the Minister did not address this anomaly in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The inclusion in the Bill of a new mechanism enabling local authority tenants to purchase flats is due to the campaign conducted by residents of flats in Cork and Dublin seeking the right to purchase their homes.  These local authority tenants have lobbied their public representatives on this issue for a decade or more.  Having introduced the legislation only a couple of weeks ago, the Minister is rushing it through the House.  Given the significance of the issue I raise, both in the past decade and no doubt in future years, it deserves to be debated in the House.</P>
        <P>The legislation will radically alter the tenant purchase scheme.  In the past, a tenant purchasing a home entered into an agreement with a local authority and received a discount of 3% on the property value for each year of tenancy, up to a maximum of ten years.  In other words, tenants could obtain a discount of up to 30% on the value of the property.  The legislation replaces the current discount mechanism with an equity discount of between 40% and 60%.  As I noted, the new scheme will be available to new tenants as well as established tenants and, as such, does not take account of the years during which residents of flats were prevented from buying their homes.</P>
        <P>As an Opposition spokesperson on housing, I am aware that I am constrained by Standing Orders in terms of the amendments I may table.  For this reason, I chose not to take a prescriptive approach to this issue.  The amendment was written with two considerations in mind.  First, I sought to ensure it would not have financial implications that would result in it being ruled out of order, thus preventing debate on the issue and precluding the House from finding a solution to the problem.  Second, I sought to give sufficient flexibility to the Minister to produce <Col N="100"/>a satisfactory outcome.  Ultimately, the amendment provides for a win-win scenario.  If passed, it will provide for the establishment of a mechanism to rectify the problem I have described by allowing the Minister to introduce an appropriate discount by means of a directive.</P>
        <P>I understand it will be some time before local authorities implement the provisions of the legislation, once enacted.  The Minister has ample time to consider this amendment over the summer recess and when we return in the autumn and the sales start to go through the local authority systems, a proper discount system would be in place.</P>
        <P>The amendment also aims to ensure a scenario does not develop whereby people who have not qualified, but who see an opportunity to slip into a programme that was not intended for them, can avail of it.  The wording of the amendment is clear.  It refers to those who have been recorded as having tried to make a purchase in the past, but who have been prohibited from doing so.  The Minister is aware that more than 100, if not 200, test cases are pending in the courts in this regard.  The issue has gone as far as the High Court.  Rather than allow this issue to linger and fester on the steps of the courts, this amendment offers a clear solution.  These court cases could be sidelined and the issue resolved through the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
        <P>I welcome the overall legislative framework the Minister of State has put in place for the sale of flats.  Some anomalies may arise with the operation of the legislation and further examination may be needed.  However, I recognise what has been achieved overall.  The Bill has been in the making for some time, but the issue has existed for many years.  The framework that came to us on Committee Stage has an obvious shortcoming, it does not cater for the people who have caused this legislation to be made.  The people responsible for the legislation before the House are not the Opposition Members who have put forward amendments or the Minister of State who has inserted a complete section regarding the sale of flats, but the people who have been campaigning for more than a decade for the right to buy their homes.  One further piece of work remains to be done in that regard, namely, to include this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe there is any area in the country with a significant urban population that does not have a complex of local authority flats.  These are usually three-storey blocks with ten or 12 flats in each.  In Cork, the only area about which I am qualified to talk, most people who live in these local authority flats find themselves in a peculiar situation.  I am aware, however, there have been several court cases with regard to flats in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and other parts of Dublin.  The issue affects most major urban areas in the country.</P>
        <P>What is unusual is that some people in Cork purchased their flats in 1994.  When these people decided to purchase, the rent they had paid was taken into account, which meant most of them had little to pay to complete the purchase of their flats.  A considerable number of people made an effort to purchase their flats at that stage, but were not successful because their homes were not for sale.  Therefore, I do not believe it is fair for the Minister of State to say these people will be treated in the exact same manner as people who have suddenly decided now they want to purchase their flats.  These people have gone to considerable effort to make their case.  They could have gone to the local authority some years ago and said they wanted to move elsewhere because they were not permitted to purchase their homes.  They could have decided to move to a house they could purchase.  However, they did not do that.  They stayed in their communities because they liked living there.  They contributed to their communities and were the main contributors to the upkeep of the properties in which they live.  They cut grass, contributed to the development of their community and paid rent, in the good times with the differential rent system.  They paid a sizable rent, more than &pound;100 in some cases and now well over &euro;100.</P><Col N="101"/>
        <P>The Minister of State cannot dismiss their case as if they were suddenly new kids on the block.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>These people are entitled to be heard and recognised.  They have consulted solicitors on the issue.  They thought their case might be recognised through the courts or the law.  They are now relying on this legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the amendment.  It is the way to solve this problem.  If the problem is not solved through this legislation, it will not go away.  It will continue to fester and will be an issue at every election.  These are determined people.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must note that,  20 years on, the legislation calls for these people to seek a mortgage to purchase their flats.  We all know mortgages are time constrained.  These people are now 20 years older.  One woman, for example, has been trying to purchase her flat for the past 15 years.  She had a good income and her husband had a good job, but now her husband can no longer work because of chronic arthritis.  What recognition is there in the legislation for her efforts to purchase her flat?  Where does it recognise that when she had the financial means to purchase her flat, she was not allowed to do so?  Now she is being told that because of the financial situation, her home is beyond her reach.  That is neither fair nor just.  This amendment allows us a way around that.</P>
        <P>We are not saying there should be a free for all or that everyone should be given this opportunity.  What we are saying is that those who were prevented from buying their homes when they could should be given favourable consideration.  It is straightforward and a matter of common justice.  Above all else, that is what we should keep in mind when making legislation here.  The amendment would give us a way out and I appeal to the Minister of State to give it serious consideration.  If it is necessary for him to take it away for consideration, that is fine.  Perhaps the officials need a second look at it.  None of us would have a problem with that.  However, the Minister of State must move on regardless today and leave these people sorer than they were to begin with.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch on this well-crafted amendment which allows the Minister of State the opportunity to address properly an issue that has over the years caused many people who live in local authority flat complexes to question the tenant purchase scheme.</P>
        <P>The area I represent includes the south-west inner city, which has the highest concentration of local authority flats of anywhere in Europe.  Many of the people in those flats are proud of their origins and of where they live, and have spent a good deal of money doing up their homes.  Some of their homes resemble palaces; a similar pride in one&rsquo;s home might not be evident in many of the most expensive houses in the country.  These people want to continue to live in their homes, but they would like to own them.</P>
        <P>I have always had a problem with regard to the sale of local authority housing stock.  The reason for my concern is that the moneys from such sales have not been properly reinvested in other local authority housing.  That said, there is a way to deal with this at local authority level.  Councils could take a decision that moneys returned should be reinvested or they should purchase or build 1.5 homes for every home sold.  There should be a mechanism in place.</P>
        <P>That should not prevent us from looking at all of the problems, anomalies and challenges of allowing people to purchase flats.  Quite a bit of work has been done on this Bill which addresses some of those issues.  There are still significant challenges out there, in terms of shared balcon<Col N="102"/>ies, charges and the like, and I wish those who will be dealing with them at local authority level the best in trying to deal with the intricacies of the challenges.</P>
        <P>This is a fair mechanism within the restrictions often put in amendments to allow the Minister to examine the issue again and reward these people for their patience in trying to deal with the discrimination that has occurred.  Everybody else in local authority housing was able to benefit from the Millennium scheme.  I have been dealing with some who did not benefit from it and are still looking for homes to be sold to them at the price they were offered some time ago.</P>
        <P>People have waited and have asked local authorities time and again for permission to buy.  I do not know how many questions I have asked about this since I was elected in 2002, but once or twice a year I have asked what the delay was in addressing the tenant purchase scheme for flats.  It is appropriate that some recognition is given to the people who went to the trouble of recording their desire to purchase the flats.  Everybody else can be dealt with in the normal scheme of things set out here and that is important.</P>
        <P>It is important we are moving to that stage because it will create a better environment in many flat complexes, where there will be a mix of those who own their own flats and those who are living in local authority housing.  That mix of people has worked well in the housing schemes, such as Part V and others,<b> </b>across the city.  It creates challenges for everyone but it is the way forward and that has been accepted by everyone.</P>
        <P>The only alternative I can see to the discount suggested is that the Minister of State agree that the sale price be set at the market value at the time these people expressed an interest.  That would create a significant burden, namely, trying to figure out what the price was on a certain date ten or 15 years ago.  That is why I am inclined towards setting a discount based on the time at which the people expressed an interest.  Hopefully the Minister of State will be able take to it on board, even at this late stage, because it does not force him to do anything today.  Rather, he can produce a directive or a regulation to the local authorities in line with what is proposed in this amendment.</P>

	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this Bill, particularly amendment No. 109.  I strongly support the amendment and I commend Deputy Lynch for tabling it.  I support it because it sorts out the legislative aspect of the whole issue and debate.  It is a strong, fair and decisive amendment and offers a solution to the particular problem.</P>
        <P>In recent days there has been much talk about the property bubble and the IMF report.  This is a real amendment and deals with a real problem faced by the families and tenants concerned.  We do not have enough discussion in the House on the rights of tenants.  This amendment puts the rights of tenants into the legislation.  Our history is steeped, going back to the time of Michael Davitt, in protecting and defending the rights of tenants and in 2009 we need a Michael Davitt approach.  This amendment is part of that approach and tradition.  It is very important.</P>
        <P>I also agree strongly with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh when he referred to flats and the need for a mix in different complexes.  That is a sensible option.  In areas where it has happened, it has been a very progressive development and has also built up stronger communities.  It is a very important part of the amendment.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to listen to the different views on this side the House and support amendment No. 109.  There are many positive aspects in the Bill, as I said earlier, in previous debates and outside the House.  The issue of housing is still significant, despite the 12 years of the Celtic tiger, and there is still a crisis in the country.  We have to face this reality politically <Col N="103"/>and examine the people and speculators out there who own many houses while there are families that cannot own, get or buy out their own dwellings.  This is an absolute disgrace, after 12 years of massive wealth in the country.</P>
        <P>In my constituency many apartments and houses are lying empty &mdash; I understand some 1,000 in Dublin North-Central &mdash; and yet many families are looking for houses.  This is also part of the issue.  I welcome the positive aspects of the Bill, but I urge the Minister to look again at amendment No. 109 and support it.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Lynch for tabling this amendment.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is long awaited.  When I served the inner city for nine years as a city councillor, there were 18 flat complexes, three of which have now been demolished.  I pay tribute to the people living in those flat complexes for the way they have lived, sometimes in very difficult times, such as when they had problems with maintenance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I always found, in all the of the complexes, genuine, decent Dubliners who were rooted in the communities where they lived and, above all, cared about each other.  It is sad to think it has taken this long for an amendment such as this to be tabled in a housing Bill.  When my mother and father bought their house on Thomas Davis Street in 1976 for &pound;3,000, Tyrone Place was across the road.  Tyrone Place is still there today and was built 47 years ago.  I know people who live there  &mdash; I grew up with their children &mdash; and are still paying large rents.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Mr. B&rdquo; has lived in his flat for 47 years, pays &euro;60 per week for it and is 79 years of age.  His family are all long gone and have moved on but he is still there.  &ldquo;Mrs. K&rdquo; has lived in a flat complex for 50 years.  She lives there with her husband and they are paying &euro;92 per week.  Their family is long gone.</P>
        <P>Ashgrove Centre on Cork Street consists of maisonettes.  In 1988 the council promised the residents they could buy the maisonettes.  They signed the agreement papers and at the last minute the rug was pulled out from under their feet, leaving them desolate.</P>
        <P>I have served on the city council for the last nine years, with other people such as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, and we have examined how housing and flat complexes are run.  It is very sad that people were not allowed to buy their own property.  It would have made a major difference to people&rsquo;s lifestyles and those who have already put a lot of money into their property would have something to hand on to their children in the future.</P>
        <P>It is a joke not to put this amendment into the Bill when we have gone this far.  These people have rights.  The people who live in flat complexes and maisonettes for generations have been faithful tenants of Dublin City Council and other councils.  They have been left waiting on the sidelines and have not been allowed to take part in the process.</P>
        <P>If nothing else comes out of this Bill the people who live in complexes in Dublin South-Central, including Tyrone Place, Basin Street, Islandbridge Court, Sarah Place, Mary Aikenhead House, Oliver Bond Street, Watling Street, School Street, St. Audeon&rsquo;s Terrace, Meath Place, Dolphin House, Summer Street, St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens, St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate and Bernard Curtis House and a few others, should be given the opportunity to be able to invest in the property in which they have lived and from which they have built up the community.  It is a reflection on how we view people in society.  It is sad that people I grew up with and who were my mother&rsquo;s neighbours and friends are still no further advanced in owning anything for themselves.  They have been faithful tenants of the council and, above all, they have made exceptional communities, which is why people are still living in these complexes after 50 years.  If nothing else is to be changed in the Bill, this is a real opportunity for the Minister of State to stand up and be counted.</P><Col N="104"/>
        <P>I commend Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch for putting the amendment forward and the many Members who have spoken on it.  In my short time in the D&aacute;il in the past two years, I have raised the issue on two or three occasions.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the drawing board, to reconsider and to accept the amendment.  If many people will never own their own property because they are too old, he can at least give a future to their families who are living beside them in their communities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  What Deputy Byrne said in regard to Dublin applies equally in Galway or any other area where there are local authority flat complexes or maisonettes.  The Bill has been promised for many years and I was told several times it would come to the House in the next session.  Finally, it is before the D&aacute;il.  It is simply a matter of the Minister of State acceding to this amendment to allow people in those complexes who have made inquiries through their public representatives and directly to the city councils, which are the authorities generally involved, to proceed with buying out their accommodation.  They were always told that legislation would have to be introduced and that the local authority could do nothing about it.</P>
        <P>House ownership is very important to the Irish people.  It is bred in their psyche and people like to have the pride of owning their homes.  In my experience, even as tenants these people have looked after their homes very well and improved them, even at their own expense in many cases where they could not wait for the local authority to do the necessary repairs and, in some cases, they improved them beyond the standard the local authority would have been able to achieve.  We should allow those people this opportunity through the Bill, which is the only opportunity we will have, although not all will avail of the opportunity.  As I noted on Committee Stage, given the way the Bill is laid out, if more than 25% of the residents of a flat complex or maisonette area do not agree to buy out their property, they will be denied this opportunity, which is very unfair and penalises those who want to buy their property.</P>
        <P>In my time on Galway City Council, when such matters were raised we were told it was simply not possible according to the current regulations to allow people in flats and maisonette complexes to buy out their properties.  We have had to wait since that time, perhaps ten years or at least since the dual mandate was abolished, before reaching the stage where the legislation is in the D&aacute;il.  We would be letting down those who made representations to Oireachtas Members as well as to many council members if we did not support this amendment.</P>
        <P>While I anticipate the amendment will go to a vote, I appeal to the Minister of State not to allow it to do so.  He should concede this is a logical and fair amendment which would satisfy needs and give people an opportunity to purchase their homes.  As Deputy Byrne said, these people have been part of their communities for perhaps ten, 20 or 30 years, and in some cases for generations.  To deny them the opportunity to own and look after their own homes is a retrograde step.  I make a serious appeal to the Minister of State who, though he does not represent an urban area, understands the reality of the situation in urban areas, where this mainly applies.</P>
        <P>If this amendment is not accepted by the Minister of State, the tenants of those complexes will be treated as second class citizens compared to their counterparts in local authority housing, perhaps just across the road from them.  It is clear discrimination in regard to flat and maisonette complexes.  The Minister of State should be big enough to accept this amendment or, if it must be rewritten in some manner, to make a change to what is currently proposed.  If this legislation goes through as it stands, the opportunity will forever be denied to those people, which is not fair.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers, I am disappointed the Minister of State has not included an amendment in regard to the ownership of flats for local authority tenants.  Clearly, my party fully supports the Labour Party amendment and we wish to commend and thank Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch for bringing it forward.  It is discriminatory and very unjust that local authority tenants cannot purchase their own homes.  It is a proven fact that if people own a property, they will be more respectful of it and appreciate it much more than if they rent the property.  Many of my colleagues have raised this issue consistently, including Deputy Catherine Byrne and Deputy Bernard Allen from Cork, who has been very critical of the Government policy not to allow people to own their own flats.</P>
        <P>There is clearly something wrong if the Minister of State is not willing to accept this very reasonable amendment.  All we seek is fairness and for this unresolved issue to be fully dealt with.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>To date, there has been no legislation on the Statute Book with regard to the purchase of flats or apartments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>There were a number of attempts over the years to put such legislation in place but they all faltered.  On 1 October 2008 on Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad, I indicated I would bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to make provision for such.  On 5 March 2009, I put that on the record of the D&aacute;il on Second Stage.  I was as good as my word on Committee Stage on 9 June, only a few weeks ago, when I came forward with such an amendment following many months of involvement with the Attorney General.  The Bill gives, for the first time in the history of the State, the right to people living in apartments and flats to purchase them.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  It seeks to give existing tenants the option of securing discounts under the new incremental purchase scheme based on the length of tenancy.  Tenancy related discounts are a feature of the existing tenant purchase scheme for houses.  However, under the new incremental purchase arrangement the discount is based, within limits, on the financial circumstances of the households.  This is a far more equitable way of tailoring the discount to the needs of individual applicants.  Members should appreciate what is involved.  The specific terms and conditions of sale to tenants, including the discounts available which will be more generous than those on offer under the existing tenant purchase scheme for local authority houses, will be determined through regulations rather than through primary legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and he has missed the point.  Legislation has been introduced for the sale of flats and I give credit to him for this.  However, for more than ten years parliamentary questions have been put asking when this <Col N="106"/>legislation would be delivered.  The implication of all those parliamentary questions was that an inherent injustice was being done which the Minister of State will not recognise.  Those people on behalf of whom the parliamentary questions were put are not recognised in the Bill.  The reason the measures have been included is because of all those parliamentary questions.  The Minister should not come to the House and claim to have introduced measures off the top of his head.  He did not do so and the measures were included because of campaigning and as a result of no other means.  The Minister of State is disguising things behind incremental purchases and other arrangements.  Those who have waited for more than a decade in this State to buy their own home will pay the same price on Monday morning as someone who walks in off the street.  This is unfair and the amendment would allow the Minister of State to rectify that situation.</P>
        <P>These people did not wish to buy property for an investment such that they could take off to Spain or Portugal to establish a phone company.  When investors were being given tax breaks by the Government and the property bubble was being created, these people were trying to pay for the roof over their heads and to turn their house into a home.  They are still waiting to do so.  These people seek a recognition that they wished to buy their own home and the House prohibited them from so doing.  I call on the Minister of State to accept the amendment and acknowledge the purpose of all the parliamentary questions referred to.</P>
        <P>The principal reason I am riled up is the absence of the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  This time last year he was in Cork, running throughout the city and county when he should have been on Haulbowline Island.  At the time he met with tenants in Cork city who had been campaigning to buy their flats for several years.  He told them everything would be fine and that they would be looked after.  However, here were are on the other side of the local elections and those tenants have been left high and dry.  The Minister of State should mark my words: this issue will not conclude this evening upon the conclusion of the debate.  It will run on and although it contains many positive aspects, this is the legacy of the legislation introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  Justice for those seeking the right to buy their homes should have been a core aspect of the legislation but they have now been left abandoned, high and dry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Minister, Deputy Gormley, will return.  Perhaps he will abstain on the vote since he made those promises to people in Cork and other areas.  The Minister did not give much credit to the Minister of State when he was in Galway and he made the same point and indicated this is what he was planning.</P>
        <P>I presume the if the Acting Chairman, Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor, were not in the Chair he would be on the floor advocating the acceptance of the amendment because he is a champion of the people he represents.  It is a pity he is confined to important duties in the Chair rather than on this side of the House because I am certain he would speak in favour of the amendment.</P>

	<P>Let me put it that I know the form and I will say no more about it.  I seek clarification on the matter of 25% before the Minister of State forces a vote.  Even if the amendment is not passed the Bill is not as clear as people believe because it does not lend the right to people who walk in off the street to buy an apartment, as Deputy Lynch remarked.  My understanding of the Bill from Committee Stage is that 25% of tenants of any complex must sign up to enter the scheme and that there would be a plebiscite of the tenants <Col N="107"/>in a given local authority scheme.  Such people might receive a ballot paper indicating if they are in favour of buying out the apartment.  Some people may not fill in such forms and others may believe they are being forced to buy the apartments because of such a process.  They might not vote or indicate they have no interest in buying the apartments.  Such people might take the view that if they voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; they would be forced to buy the apartment.  We should clarify the matter of 25% as well.  What is the position if 25% of the people in any complex do not vote?  I understand 25% was the figure mentioned on Committee Stage and I call on the Minister to clarify the matter.  The proposal may be null and void in such circumstances and no one in such a complex would then be allowed to buy an apartment.  It is a very serious matter for the tenants and if only 15% or 20% of them wish to buy out the apartments in a complex such people should be allowed to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the figure 25% of the entire complex or does it only apply to a block?  If it refers to a block then I would accept that.  However, what if there is a block of eight and there is one on every landing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>

	<P>It is an interesting debate and it is a pity the matter has not been teased out more.  However, I did not attend Committee Stage for which I apologise.</P>
        <P>There is no recognition in what has been presented thus far of the length of time for which the individuals in question have requested purchase.  They have been discriminated against from the time they expressed an interest to the council and they were blocked because the system was not in place to allow them to purchase a local authority dwelling.  I use the term &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; rather than home.</P>
        <P>I refer to the 40% and 60% discounts to which the Minister of State mentioned.  I understand the Minister of State has suggested the commitment is that from a given day, those who applied on that day will only receive 40% while those who previously applied would benefit in the order of 60%.  That, at least, is a recognition of what we seek, that is, a recognition from the State and the local authority that those who applied prior to a given date would benefit from such an application or, at least, have been recognised.  If that is not the intention of the 40% and 60% discounts then a percentage must be applied above that amount.  That is the only fair and reasonable way of dealing with the anomaly created which has prevented people from purchasing local authority apartments to date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I was somewhat taken aback with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch made a clear point and the remarks of the Minister of State have clarified a good deal.  People do not seek charity, they seek justice.  We spent the past week in the Chamber discussing justice and the case of people who had been let down by society, but we are here again doing exactly the same thing.  We are letting down a certain sector of people because they live in a certain place and they have been classed as a certain kind of citizen.  This is wrong and it is unjust.  People are not looking for anything else but just to be rewarded for being dedicated and loyal tenants to the State and to the councils around the country.  They have put up with a lot of hassle and rubbish and untidy places down through the years.  This is the Minister of State&rsquo;s opportunity because the ball is in his court.  He has a real chance of making a bit of history here and he should grasp that opportunity with both hands this evening.  This is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this House and if the Minister of State wants, he can do this and I know he will have the support of many people in his party.  This is a small price to pay to allow people have an opportunity to buy their own homes. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="108"/>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an old saying that the Ritz is available to everyone, in other words, anyone with enough money can go into the Ritz.  This Bill is a little like that old saying.  The Government is offering people the chance to buy their home but there is a condition of sale which will make it impossible for them to buy.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply was most disingenuous but I am not certain that I blame him.  I think he has been convinced by the argument that this is a good deal but he has failed to take a serious look at the people who are now in their late 40s and early 50s, who have been trying to buy their homes for 20 years.  There is no recognition of their effort.  As Deputy McCormack said, when the forms come through the door from the local authority, most of those people will not fill them out for the simple reason that they filled them out 20 years ago and nothing came of it.  Now they are no longer in a position to get a mortgage that will cover the entire cost of purchase.  The Minister of State must recognise this fact.  Even with the 40% equity, these people must also be given the 30% discount because they would have got that anyway.  Someone in an apartment for the past two years and who decides to purchase will be given the same deal as those people.  They have been paying rent, maintaining their properties and maintaining entire communities, as Deputy Catherine Byrne said.  They could have left, they could have walked away but they did not; they stayed.  If it was not for them, we would have bigger trouble than we have now in the form of anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to take another look at this amendment and to use his common sense.  He knows as well as I do that this is a good amendment that will save us all an awful lot of grief.</P>

	<P>While discounts have been related to the length of tenancy for many years in the tenant purchase schemes for houses, I would question the logic of granting a subsidy to a person to buy a property solely on the basis of the length of time which he or she has been subsidised in renting that property.  It seems to me, as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, that it is a much fairer approach to tailor the subsidy to a person&rsquo;s capacity to pay for the property and that is what this legislation provides for.  This is worth reflecting upon.  Subsequent to the legislation being enacted, I will be bringing in regulations rather than primary legislation.   </P>

The other matters regarding percentages for the plebiscite or the number of people who would buy properties were dealt with on Committee Stage.  The Bill has a very generous approach to the sale of property when a person&rsquo;s ability to pay is taken into consideration.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendments and I will be dealing with the matter by regulation. </P>

	<P>There is the structure in which he is allowing the sale to take place and this is a radical change.  The existing tenant purchase scheme of the 3% over a ten-year period, maximising to 30%, will not be available to those who buy flats, regardless of whether they have been trying to buy for the past ten years or are trying to buy it next week.  This scheme is now gone and what is being introduced is a different type of tenant purchase scheme.  The Minister of State is correct in that it is based on ability to pay or affordability.  What is happening here is a unique and anomalous situation where people have been willing to pay for the past ten years but the councils would not take their money because the House did not provide the legislative framework to allow the money to be taken from them. </P>

	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s management of the issue is at question.  This has been a core question related to the Bill since it came before the House.  The question was when would there be a legislative framework for the sale of flats.  Every Deputy who raised this question was informed that the legislative framework would be in place when the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was dealt with by the D&aacute;il.  That framework was not included in the Bill when it came before the D&aacute;il; it only came in two weeks&rsquo; ago.  The Minister of State has not given enough time for the Bill to be debated in detail and he is covering up the absence of a proper debate on this issue.  At the eleventh hour we have to appeal to him to rectify something because the Bill has been mismanaged with regard to the affordability factor.  People cannot get a mortgage at this stage because they will be unable to clear that mortgage before the age of 65.  </P>
        <P>I will pause while the Minister of State confers with his officials.  I refer to an anomaly with regard to incremental purchase which has been created by the Minister of State.  The mortgage must be taken out over a minimum of 20 years.</P>

I was hoping the Minister of State would see the sense of my amendment.  I regret the way in which this matter has been introduced at the eleventh hour leaving little time for debate.  I made this point to the Minister of State on Committee Stage.  A week later, because it took me a week to get a briefing from the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials, I explained the difficulty to the officials.</P>
        <P>I had hoped the Minister of State would bring forward an amendment so I could withdraw my amendment but that has not happened.  The aspirations and hope that this House would rectify a long-standing injustice have been denied.  They will be unable to buy their homes.  They will be forced to return to the courts instead of having the matter dealt with by legislation.  The Minister who met the people concerned in various parts of the country does not have the decency to come to the House and contribute to this debate.</P>
        <P>When Deputy Kathleen Lynch and I met a number of residents in Cork city last Monday night we told them we would be dealing with this matter in the D&aacute;il this evening and that we hoped to bring this issue to a successful conclusion.  I do not say this in an adversarial way but simply to bring common sense to the Minister.</P>
        <P>This is a small issue.  It affects no more than 200 or 300 people in the entire country.  It will not create a massive cash flow problem for any Department.  In fact, if the discount was to be made by way of equity it would not cost the State a penny, because it would be a notional cost.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has done a great deal since he came to the Department.  His predecessor was chased around the House on this issue for many years and did nothing about it.  Deputy Finneran has, at least, done something.  Unfortunately, he has missed the key aspect of this section of the Bill, which is fair play and long overdue justice.  The right to buy should be put in place and a long-standing injustice rectified.  It is a great pity the Minister of State cannot see that.</P>

Subsection (6)(<i>b</i>) provides that where over 75% of the members present and voting do not approve of the proposed charge, the existing charge shall remain in place until the adoption of a new charge.  The provision, as drafted, could be read as implying that each member present has only one vote on the service charge.  However, as section 65(3)(<i>a</i>) makes clear, a person who owns more than one apartment in the complex, notably the housing authority, has one vote in respect of each such apartment.  Therefore, the housing authority and any other multiple apartment owners, if present, should be counted separately for each apartment it owns, for the purpose of both voting and calculating the 60% and 75% threshold.  These amendments clarify this matter.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">These amendments are being made to section 68, which requires the management company to establish a sinking fund for the purpose of spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature, and to levy a sinking fund contribution on apartments each year.  As currently drafted, the section provides that the management company shall not operate an estimate of a sinking fund contribution that, when apportioned over apartments in the complex, results in a charge on any apartment that is less than the amount prescribed by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 124 introduces a threshold of &euro;200 as the amount that may be prescribed by the Minister for this purpose.  Amendments Nos. 125, 126 and 128 set the same thresholds to allow the management company, without reference to members, to adopt a sinking fund contribution that on apportionment across apartments results in the lowest charge on any apartment that is equal to &euro;200, or an amount as may be prescribed by the Minister.  However, where the company estimates sinking fund contribution results on apportionment in a charge <Col N="115"/>on any apartment that exceeds &euro;200 or an amount that may be prescribed by the Minister, the contribution must be adopted by a general meeting of members convened for that purpose.  The company members are precluded from adopting a contribution that, on apportionment, results in a charge on any apartment that is less than &euro;200 or an amount that may be prescribed by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 68(6) empowers the Minister to make a regulation in respect of classes of expenditure for items that may be financed from the sinking fund in respect of thresholds of expenditure that must be approved by members.  Amendments Nos. 130 and 131 are drafting amendments to improve the clarity of subsection (6).  Amendment No. 132 extends the matter the Minister may prescribe in regulations to include any other amount for the purpose of subsection (3), having regard to the average level of service charge in the designated apartment complexes.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The national employment action plan, NEAP, operated jointly by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and F&Aacute;S, is the main welfare-to-work measure for jobseekers.  The plan&rsquo;s process is fundamental in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Under the plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching three months on the live register are identified by the Department and referred to F&Aacute;S for interview <Col N="120"/>with a view to assisting them in entering or re-entering the labour market.  The referral capacity under the plan has nearly doubled for 2009 from 6,500 cases per month to 12,250.  In addition, the Government is now providing, through F&Aacute;S, a total of 128,000 training and activation places for unemployed people this year.  There are also some 147,000 places available in further education programmes in 2009.  This is a substantial increase on the number of places previously available.  In response to the downturn in the construction industry sector and in recognition of the special difficulties faced by apprentices who are being laid off, the Department and F&Aacute;S are working together to facilitate them in finishing their apprenticeships.</P>
        <P>The recent supplementary budget outlined a joint approach to activation by the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science.  I introduced a package of measures relating to the Department&rsquo;s back to work enterprise allowance and back to education allowance to facilitate better access to supports.  The package put together by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science has some 11 proposals to provide 23,435 extra employment and training scheme places.</P>
        <P>With the increasing number of people who are unemployed, the Government is continuing to develop and put in place new programmes to enhance the work experience and training opportunities for them.  Two such initiatives, the work placement programme and a pilot short-time working training<b> </b>programme, were announced recently.  Under both initiatives, participants will continue to receive their existing social welfare entitlements from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  These new programmes, together with those already in place, demonstrate a substantive commitment on the part of the Government to create and implement initiatives that support and assist those finding themselves without work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the new initiatives announced by the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste in recent weeks, is the former satisfied with the sufficiency of the number of places?  The work placement and short-time working programmes consist of approximately 2,277 places over a 52-week period whereas 3,375 jobs are being lost every seven days.</P>
        <P>I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions regarding referrals to F&Aacute;S.  The total number of referrals has almost doubled.  While this sounds fantastic, looking behind the figures for the results shows a pathetic situation.  Last year, the Department of Social and Family Affairs referred 60,000 people to F&Aacute;S.  Some 41,000 were interviewed and 7,846 were placed in jobs, training or education.  According to the Minister, 21,000 were interviewed but not placed in jobs, training or education.  What occurred to those 21,000 people and what of the 12,000 who formed part of the original 41,000?  They have just gone.</P>
        <P>The figures for the first quarter of this year are even more worrying.  Of those sent to F&Aacute;S, only 7% were placed in jobs, training or education.  Last year, the figure for people with a successful outcome was 13%.  What follow-up does the Department carry out after people are sent to F&Aacute;S to ensure that instead of just sending people for a short period or an interview, we are sending them to get something out of the opportunity?  In the current climate, 7% for the first quarter is pathetic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent announcements should be viewed as a package of measures.  The Deputy asked about the 2,000 work and graduate placement places.  It is a new initiative and there is nothing to say that, once it is up and running and people have registered with it, we should not be able to extend it.  An initial number of 2,000 places is worth the effort.  They will last for six months.  Some 1,000 will go to graduates and 1,000 will go to other workers, 250 of which will be reserved for people under the age of 25 years.  Since it is being done through F&Aacute;S and both jobseekers and participating employers can register, a number of issues <Col N="121"/>must be teased out to make sure that there is no job displacement, that is, killing off existing positions.  I would welcome the programme&rsquo;s expansion.</P>
        <P>While I do not want to repeat myself, additional places have been made available in the further education sector.  The Deputy did not mention the recent announcement on the expressions of interest being sought from the third level sector in a part-time course that will make 2,500 places available.  They all add up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Not to much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked about people who are referred to F&Aacute;S.  It is always interesting to note that, as soon as people get a letter about being called for interview, they leave the live register.  Some 12% left immediately.  They did not even go for their interviews.  It could be a control measure, that is, they might not have believed that they had been on the live register legitimately.  Perhaps they found other opportunities.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about this year&rsquo;s figures.  I am also disappointed that so few people have been placed in education and training.  However, it was not the time of year to place people in either.  For example, were one looking for places in further or higher education, one would not find them in March, April or May.  I hope that the programme&rsquo;s take-up will increase in September when people who have been interviewed can be guided into the places in question.  We must obviously keep an eye on this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When people return to the live register, they are interviewed after a further three months.  It is not as if they are just left there.  The process is ongoing in conjunction with the education sector and F&Aacute;S.  As the Deputy stated, the local employment service network, LESN, is on board throughout most of the country and is providing training and education for people who might not be picked up by other services.  The LESN is running literacy, preparation for work and preparation for college courses.  It is a valuable service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Even if the figure is not 7% by the end of the year, 87% of people referred to F&Aacute;S last year did not jump off the live register when they received their letters.  What is occurring in respect of that large number?  Having a referral system is easy, but the outcomes are important, as I am sure the Minister agrees.  Judging by these outcomes, the system is failing.</P>
        <P>Given the Minister&rsquo;s statement that people are signing back on, when will she deal with the issue of people doing short-term F&Aacute;S courses signing off and signing on?  This situation causes more queues and difficulties for her Department and the people themselves.</P>
        <P>Has it been suggested to the Department&rsquo;s facilitators that they should get involved in fraud control measures?  It has been put to me that facilitators have been asked to spend one day per week on fraud control as opposed to facilitation work.  Is this is the case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Of the people referred this year, 36% left the live register.  Some 15% did this after their interviews and 12%, the control measure people, did not turn up for their interviews.  Only 9% were placed in jobs, education or training, which is the matter on which I share the Deputy&rsquo;s disappointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should address it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that the figure will pick up later this year.</P><Col N="122"/>
        <P>The process is being streamlined.  People who leave the live register to take on short-term work or F&Aacute;S training will have their re-applications to the social welfare system streamlined.  This is important because it will free up staff and reduce queues.</P>
        <P>I am unaware of facilitators being asked to work one day per week as described.  Everyone is on the alert for reasons of fraud control.  I will check out whether facilitators were asked to do that specifically.</P>

        <Quest> the steps she is taking to deal with the long waiting times for the processing of claims in her Department; the target waiting period which she has set for the processing of jobseeker claims; and when she expects to meet that target. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of people on the live register almost doubled between May 2008 and May 2009 to a total of nearly 397,000.  The average processing time for claims decided in May was 3.4 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and 6.4 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  These are averages and I appreciate that waiting times are longer in some areas.  In other areas they are shorter than the average.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined to ensure that people who have lost their jobs or been put on shorter working weeks can get access to their entitlements as quickly as possible.  To that end, productivity in local offices has increased, claim processing procedures have been improved and extra staff have been put in place.  In the five month period to May 2009, over 222,500 claims for jobseeker payments were decided in local offices, up from 133,000 in the same period last year.</P>
        <P>As a result of staffing reviews in 2008 and again in recent months, some 300 extra staff have been assigned to local offices, new central support units and the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate since May 2008.  These include 90 temporary staff who have been appointed to local offices around the country pending the assignment of permanent staff.  Arrangements are also in train to allocate a further 24 inspector posts.</P>
        <P>The processing target for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is 90% of claims processed in three weeks.  In May, 60% of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claims were decided within that time.  For jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance the target is 90% in six weeks and 65% of claims were decided within this time in May.  It is not possible to predict when these targets will be met while the live register continues to increase to record numbers but I am conscious that people need to get access to financial and other supports as quickly as possible and we will continue to work hard to bring processing times back in line with targets.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment can apply for supplementary welfare allowance which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>To say people can get supplementary welfare allowance while waiting to get their claim processed is incorrect.  They cannot do that because there are waiting lists to see community welfare officers.  The failure to tackle the waiting lists within the Minister&rsquo;s Department is putting enormous pressure on the community welfare service and organisations like MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  People are going without food and other essentials because the services cannot cope with the demand.  The Minister quoted figures but <Col N="123"/>the reality is that no improvement has taken place in waiting times, the most recent figures have shown that  39 offices have waiting times of over two months for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>Whatever about jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, what about jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, which is a simple matter of checking a person&rsquo;s social insurance record?  Although no means testing is involved, waiting times in some offices are more than nine weeks.  How can that be explained?</P>
        <P>The Minister must get the finger out and get moving.  There is a deluge of applications and people are being left to wait for a payment of any kind.  They simply cannot survive in those circumstances.  It is unacceptable that a basic public service such as social welfare is not accessible to people when they need it.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister to tell the House exactly how many additional posts have been sanctioned for the Department.  She mentioned 300 posts.  Are all of those 300 in place?  How many additional staff will be needed and how many have been sanctioned by the Department of Finance to date?</P>
        <P>Can the Minister pinpoint where exactly delays exist in the Department?  Are they in means testing, in assessing habitual residence or at the frontline?  Where are the blockages?  The Minister must be specific as she goes about tackling this problem because her efforts to date have not been sufficient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy drew attention to a number of issues.  There are only two offices where there is a nine week wait for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, both of them in the Cork area.  In fairness to the others, one might mention those offices where it can be done in less than a week or in two weeks.  In the vast majority of offices, claims are processed in a much shorter time.  I appreciate jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit can be done more speedily because it is based on the record and I hope the arrangement that started in the Dundalk office, where decisions were being made on the day on claims, can be extended to the rest of the country.  Unfortunately the CPSU stopped that even though it was in everybody&rsquo;s interest, staff and applicant alike, because it can be done quickly.</P>
        <P>The longest delays are in branch offices.  Agreement was reached with the branch officers in April 2008 that they would be able to make decisions locally.  At the moment, they take in the applications, which are then taken from them and given to the local office.  Because local offices have their own demands, to date they have not given priority to branch offices.  Agreement was reached with them in April 2008 that they could make their own decisions but the CPSU will not allow that because it claims it is outsourcing.  We cannot cope with the flood coming from branch offices to local offices but this would free up staff in local offices and would benefit people.</P>
        <P>Those are two key issues where we could have far greater cooperation.  The Deputy asked about the third area, the community welfare officers.  The sooner we can have an integrated process with the CWOs coming into the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the better.  Again this has been blocked for years but it has been referred to the Labour Relations Commission and we expect a date for hearings shortly.  SIPTU has agreed to participate, although so far IMPACT has not, and I hope we can secure agreement on the idea.  That will lead to better service for everyone because it is not right that people should have to wait.</P>
        <P>The 300 staff were put in place between May 2008 and May 2009.  Some of those have been put in place in the last few months.  At the start of the year we indicated that we wanted 300 staff this year so we will be looking for another 150 staff.  Those staff are on their way from other Departments, there is no question of any blockage, but they must be trained and deployed in the right places.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="124"/>

	<P>How many of them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have also established the central units that are working effectively.  They have no front of house contact but are solely making decisions on claims.  The next central unit will open in Tallaght on 6 July.  Huge progress has been made and the productivity of the staff has really improved.  From January until May this year they processed 250,000 claims while in the same time last year they processed 146,000.</P>
        <P>Through the establishment of the central units and the efforts being made all round to ensure applicants can be dealt with as speedily as possible progress is being made, although I appreciate there are delays in some areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>If there are industrial relations issues it is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility to deal with them swiftly.  Whatever about problems within the Minister&rsquo;s own offices, the suggestion that the problem lies with the need for the community welfare officers to transfer into the Department of Social and Family Affairs is entirely wide of the mark. </P>

	<P>What difference will it make if they come under a different Department?  If there are not enough staff, there are not enough staff, irrespective of what they are called.  The Minister should deal with the industrial relations issues and stop hiding behind them. </P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>How many additional posts have been approved over and above the 300?  When will they be in place?</P>
        <P>Last year the Department of Social and Family Affairs had one of the highest rates of absenteeism, with an average of 15 sick days per year.  What is the current situation and what steps is the Minister taking to deal with that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The transfer of the community welfare officers is central.  They spend the Department&rsquo;s money and the Department pays the Department of Health and Children to pay them to pay the money.  That is not an efficient, integrated system.  The Department has no difficulty in getting staff from other Departments but there is a difficulty in the HSE, even though they have had extra places sanctioned.  There are issues there, however, related to back-filling.  However, although extra places have been sanctioned for the HSE, issues arise over backfilling or some other phenomenon.  I am not quite sure about the intricacies of the process.  It is not quite relevant here.  Undoubtedly, were the officers to be part of our Department, we could ensure that we would be able to fill any vacancies if staffing difficulties arose.  This is because we have powers of sanction.</P>
        <P>I indicated at the beginning of this year that we need 300 additional staff.  One hundred and fifty of those are currently in place and we expect to get the other 150.  They have been placed in local offices and the central units.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the action she has taken to persuade lenders, other than members of the Irish Banking Federation, to sign up to the new IBF-MABS Operational Protocol: Working Together to Manage Debt; the reason she did not ensure that sub-prime lenders were made aware of and included in discussions on the new protocol; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[25548/09] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  The regulation of financial institutions, including the banks, sub-prime mortgage lenders and the credit unions, is part of the statutory remit of the Financial Regulator.  Legislative issues in regard to the Financial Regulator are dealt with by the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Under the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears published by the Financial Regulator, all financial institutions, including the banks and sub-prime mortgage lenders, must, where circumstances warrant it, refer a borrower in difficulty for guidance to his or her local MABS office or an appropriate alternative.</P>
        <P>The new protocol, IBF-MABS Operational Protocol: Working Together to Manage Debt, is the result of almost two years of work by MABS NDL, the national support company for the MABS network and the Irish Banking Federation, IBF, the main representative body for the banking and financial services sector.  The protocol sets out an agreed process by which IBF members and the MABS money advisers will approach debt problems experienced by clients.  The protocol includes a commitment that no legal action will be taken as long as there is compliance by the client with an agreed repayment plan.  Thirteen financial institutions, including the main banks and building societies, have to date signed up to the protocol.</P>
        <P>With regard to those other lenders that are not members of the IBF, such as sub-prime mortgage lenders, the MABS advisers will continue to negotiate with these creditors on an individual basis to secure better terms for MABS clients in managing the repayment of the debts.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by the response to the MABS-IBF initiative and the willingness of lenders, not just those who are members of the IBF, to support the protocol.  In the subsequent media reports and correspondence I received, other lenders have indicated that they would be happy to support the protocol.  I urge all lenders to adhere to the best-practice procedures set out in the protocol.  I have asked MABS NDL to follow up on the correspondence I have received and to explore further the possibilities for other lenders.</P>
        <P>MABS NDL has initiated work with the Irish League of Credit Unions with a view to developing a similar operating protocol with its members that would set out best practice to support MABS clients in managing debts owed to credit unions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>At the launch of the MABS protocol on 3 June, the Minister was critical of the fact that the sub-prime lending companies had not signed up to it.  Her Department finances the operation of MABS and the lenders come under its auspices in that sense.  Did the Minister not believe, prior to criticising the sum-prime lenders, that it would have been better to have them involved or to ask MABS to get them involved?  The main group with a high rate of personal borrowing and other financial difficulties comprises those in the sub-<Col N="126"/>prime area.  The highest rate of interest being paid is being paid by those in this category.  Therefore, having the sub-prime lenders involved is of the utmost importance.</P>
        <P>Research that the IBF presented to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs yesterday shows only 40% of borrowers find debt management easy, which means 60% do not.  Most of these can manage if they are careful but 15% of the 60% have cause for concern or a real problem.  This problem will grow.  What discussions has the Minister had with the sub-prime institutions and will she ensure that they sign up to the protocol?  While they got an easy buy-out by virtue of the fact that they are not regulated, they are licensed and need to be very involved with the protocol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept they should be involved with the protocol.  When launching it, I suggested this.  In fairness, within two days one sub-prime lender wrote to me indicating it would sign up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>They have never been asked to do so and they do not know about the protocol.  It is very hard to sign up to it if one does not know about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The IBF is a regulatory body.  All the groundwork was done with the IBF and this means there is an established protocol.  A financial institution that is not a member of the IBF indicated immediately that it would sign up to the protocol.  Any institution can sign up to the protocol within days now that the work has been done on it.  This is equally the case with the credit unions, but one should remember MABS has a very positive relationship with the credit unions anyway.</P>
        <P>The Deputy was correct about the extended loans people have and the difficulties they face in managing them.  It is very worrying to consider the average debt people have incurred.  This, in itself, has increased.  This time last year, it was &euro;12,500 while it was &euro;7,500 just before that.  Now the figure has risen to &euro;14,500.  Therefore, the people who are contacting MABS this year have more extended debt in all sorts of areas than those who were doing so even last year or the year theretofore.</P>
        <P>When one examines this debt, one notes it is not generally constituted of loans from the main mortgage lenders, as we often believe, but of personal loans.  Personal credit is the main form of debt and I accept it is much more difficult for people to manage than other forms of debt.  MABS is doing a very good job in this area.</P>
        <P>I am delighted at least one sub-prime lender and another financial institution immediately took up the invitation to sign up to the protocol.  We will work to ensure that the others do so also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister is delighted the institutions took up the invitation, should MABS not have contacted them in advance to ensure that they would sign up?</P>
        <P>The Minister will probably be aware of the comments of the Master of the High Court.  He still expects an avalanche of claims.  The figure in this regard has trebled since he made his comment in February.  Will the protocol be sufficient?  The Master of the High Court is listening to what is being said every morning.  He hears the stories of the people affected, many of whom have no legal representation, and he believes the worst has yet to come in terms of repossession cases in his court.  Will the protocol prevent this?  Are the comments the Master of the High Court made this week correct?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="127"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The protocol will go some way towards preventing it, particularly if the sub-prime lenders sign up.  It is not necessary that they be part of the negotiation because it is easy to formulate a protocol with one regulatory body, which is what the IBF is.</P>
        <P>In the first quarter of this year, there were nine repossessions of owner-occupied homes.  While repossession is extremely traumatic for the families concerned, there has not been the avalanche about which people talk.  Where orders for repossessions have taken place, they have not necessarily been in respect of residential homes, nor have the orders been enforced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because people sold their houses to pay the debts.  People are still losing their houses. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that as a result of this protocol, which has been devised after much negotiation, repossession will only occur as a last resort.  As long as people make a genuine effort to stick to the repayment plan devised for them by MABS in conjunction with the credit institution, we will not see this happening.</P>

	<P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs, through the wide range of services it provides, touches everyone&rsquo;s life at some stage.  Our overall goal is to provide people with the information, financial support and other services they require in a timely and customer-friendly way.</P>
        <P>The Department administers 2 million applications for 50 different schemes each year.  Last month alone, it cleared some 207,000 claims.  We are committed to ensuring that claims for payment are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply.  These conditions vary from scheme to scheme and may involve, among other criteria, the need to establish the person&rsquo;s social insurance record; verification of his or her medical incapacity to work; confirmation of his or her place of habitual residence; and, where appropriate, the assessment of means.  Additional information may also have to be sought.  These factors, along with a significant increase in the claim load of a particular scheme, can affect processing times.</P>
        <P>There are specific performance targets set for each scheme and these are monitored closely and action is taken where appropriate.  I appreciate there are delays in some areas and I have outlined to the House on another occasion the steps we are taking to improving processing times, for the jobseekers&rsquo; payments in particular.</P>
        <P>Investment in our staff and modern information communications technologies is central to improving the quality of the service we provide to the public.  Our new website and text messaging service have made it easier for people to access information at a time that suits them.  The Department&rsquo;s website recently won an e-government award for accessibility.  We are also working to ensure a high quality service continues to be available by telephone, in our local offices, through the citizens information centres and by post.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the significant rise in applications for some schemes is presenting major challenges for the Department.  I assure the Deputies that we are committed to meeting the needs of the increasing number of people who rely on our support, while also providing a high standard of service.</P>

	<P>I will deal with the issue of processing times later in respect of my other questions.  I tabled this question because of the high rate of appeals to the Department.  I am concerned about the high rate of successful appeals because if the system operated effectively there should not be such a high rate.  I will cite three examples from last year.  More than half of all appeals for the carer&rsquo;s allowance were upheld in 2007 and 2008 but the people who appealed had to wait six months for the appeals to be granted, on top of their initial application time; 40% of appeals for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance last year were upheld and the people had to wait five months; 54% of appeals for disability allowance were upheld and those people also had to wait six months.  What is going wrong in the initial assessment of those claims?  It is not a question of medical reports because they are not all health related.  That would not apply in the jobseekers area.  Where are the mistakes in the initial assessments in those three examples?  There are many other examples.  Approximately 60%, of the areas covered by the Department have a high rate of successful appeals.  What is going wrong?  The processing times in the first place are a problem and so are those for the appeals as half the people who are entitled to the payments must wait several months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Each scheme is different and has different requirements.  Where medical evidence is required it will take some time.  To get the carer&rsquo;s allowance one must show that the person for whom one is caring is in need of full-time care which involves a medical certificate.  It quite often happens that an application is made with insufficient information on means or household income and that can give rise to an appeal.  The Deputy mentioned some instances where different information would be sought.</P>
        <P>As a control measure it is probably just as well that not everyone gets everything on the first go.  We try to ensure the processing times are quite quick.  It is easy to focus on the jobseekers in the first instance and say that is where there are delays but given that the Department receives 2 million applications each year, some are very speedily dealt with, many within one or two weeks.  The appeals and the processing times can be two separate things but there are problems in appeals too and going to oral hearings, etc.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not accept in any sense that this is a good control measure because more than half the people who appealed in those three instances were found to be entitled to the payment which means that there was no issue of fraud or of trying to pull the wool over the Department&rsquo;s eyes.  These people were entitled to the payment and had to wait the initial application time, which could have been 19 weeks in Boyle, and then had to wait five months in the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>The medical documents for the carer&rsquo;s and disability allowances are not a problem because most people would have proved on application that the person was entitled to the benefit.  I would like some figures from the Minister on why these appeals are being granted.  She may be able to supply them afterwards.  I do not think insufficient information accounts for all those successful appeals.  Anyone in the House could give the Minister examples of appeals they have lodged for people that have nothing to do with insufficient information.  It is a substantial number and it is very unfair that these people are being asked to wait.</P>
        <P>The Minister has not answered my question about the breakdown of the initial assessment because while there are different types of payments, the people in the Department who deal with carer&rsquo;s allowance deal exclusively with that payment, and likewise the jobseeker&rsquo;s and disability allowances.  They are experts in their areas so it is not a question of being a different type of payment.  They know how to deal with the applications and there must be a breakdown for such a sizeable success rate in appeals.  This needs to be dealt with.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the Green Paper on pensions was published in October 2007, the Government has been progressing policy in this area.  We have also responded to meet the immediate difficulties facing employees, especially those in defined benefit schemes, who saw both their companies and pension schemes facing difficult situations.  The collapse in equity values and the economic situation combined to create severe difficulties for people who saw significant reductions in their potential benefits as a result.</P>
        <P>The Government moved to protect people&rsquo;s entitlements through measures announced last December and the recent legislation passed in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009.  These include the establishment of a pensions insolvency payment scheme, a reordering of wind-up priorities, provision for restructuring of pension benefits and stronger regulation with regard to remittance of pension contributions.  Where decisions have been required to protect people&rsquo;s entitlements, the Government has moved quickly to assist pension scheme members.  We have also been engaged in discussions with the social partners on key issues, including pensions.</P>
        <P>The Government is aware that the wide and long-term pensions policy issues require a comprehensive and co-ordinated response.  Following the conclusion of the successful consultation process last year, we have been considering several options to address the challenges facing our pensions system and which were raised in the Green Paper process.  These issues relate to social welfare pensions, the sustainability of our pension system generally, the adequacy of <Col N="130"/>current provision, and other complex issues around regulation, public sector pensions and retirement age.</P>
        <P>As I have previously said in this House, it is the intention of the Government to deal with all of these issues.  Over the past year, the economic environment has changed considerably and we need to ensure any decisions we make in the pensions area are robust enough to withstand new and unprecedented challenges.  It is entirely appropriate that the Government takes the time to arrive at sound decisions about the future of our pension system, given the potential of such decisions to impact significantly on this and future generations.  Our objective is a system which will deliver an adequate retirement income for all which is, at the same time, affordable and sustainable for the State and for those who sponsor and provide pension schemes.</P>
        <P>The Government has responded quickly to the severe difficulties facing defined benefit schemes.  We will continue to discuss further reform options for inclusion in the national pensions framework and I expect that this will be published this year as announced in the partnership talks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.  She may think it entirely appropriate that the Government takes time but it has taken 12 years with little or no progress.  There has been a little progress on defined benefit and none on the overall pension problem.  I am glad the Minister says the framework will be published this year but on Question Time at the end of April she told me it would be published in a couple of weeks.  That was two months ago.  A couple of weeks is a fortnight.  The end of the year is a long time away.  We are only half way through the year.  Will the Minister give a more definite date?</P>
        <P>The OECD says that 30% of Irish pensioners live in poverty.  A year ago when we asked questions about this I said that fewer people were going to want to invest in a pension because of their fears about how they operate and the Minister said that would not be the case.  Only a quarter of Irish people now think it is a good idea to put money aside for their retirement.  The longer the Minister leaves a decision on pensions the bigger the timebomb she is creating for the country.  One million people are due to retire over the next 20 years.  By making progress on this issue the Minister can give them some certainty about their retirement.  They do not have that now.  People are terrified.  What she has done so far is nothing compared with what needs to be done.  Will the Minister provide the House with a more definitive date?  Does she have any idea what is being considered by the Government because an element of private sector workers feel they have been ignored in what has been done so far?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that I indicated that it might be sooner than now but the Government has decided to give it further consideration and that is its prerogative.  However, the paper circulated to the social partners this week indicated that it would be done this year.  As I outlined, we have genuinely been working very hard on a number of issues that are most relevant to people today and the fact that publication of the framework will be a number of months later than I had indicated should not delay its implementation because it was never going to be implemented in 2009 or 2010 anyway.  I had always indicated that as in the UK it would probably start in 2012 approximately.</P>
        <P>The number of people investing in their pensions has increased.  Surprisingly, given the way the market has gone there are indications that people have started to provide even more for their future.  I know that the particular age group in which we hoped to see an increase to 70% is at 61% so it is moving in the right direction.</P><Col N="131"/>
        <P>The OECD report refers to figures from 2005 and since then the non-contributory pension has increased by 32% and the contributory pension has increased by 28%.  The authors of the OECD report recognise that the increase in public pensions since 2005 will have improved the economic position of older people and they recognise that significant progress has been made in those years.  As we know, the consistent poverty rate for older people has fallen to 2% from 3.7% in 2005 so progress has been made.  The OECD report, while critical, has not taken into account the improvements made in the past four years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The improvements relate to the State pension; they do not relate to the plethora of other pension areas which have not been improved, rather have seen a disimprovement.  The Minister mentioned an implementation period of 2012 and I know she stated that previously but it is much too far away.  Either way, the report still needs to be published so people know what will be there and can make plans because the crucial aspects of pensions are planning and time.  Does the Minister mean publication at the very end of the year or during the summer?  Does she have any idea of a wider timeframe? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly do not mean during the summer but as soon as possible thereafter when we get agreement from the Government.  It is crucial and it will impact on private pensions, social welfare pensions and public sector pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the expected gain to the Exchequer if the PRSI ceiling was abolished; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23142/09] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The PRSI system is based on the contributory and solidarity principles.  The contributory principle ensures there is a direct link between the contributions paid and the range of benefits and pensions to which the person is entitled.  The solidarity principle relates to the redistributive nature of the system which ensures supports are provided to more vulnerable workers.</P>
        <P>Current estimates indicate that the abolition of the PRSI ceiling would yield approximately &euro;119.5 million additional contribution income in a full year.</P>
        <P>Under the PRSI system social insurance contributions are compulsorily payable by employers, employees and self-employed workers.  With regard to employees&rsquo; contributions the amount payable is determined by reference to reckonable earnings in a weekly period, and is subject to a range of thresholds and an annual ceiling.  Approximately 76% of workers pay PRSI Class A and Class H at the rate of 4% and accrue entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions under various social insurance schemes.</P>
        <P>The PRSI exemption on low earnings stands at &euro;352 per week.  People with incomes at that level or below are exempt from PRSI.  Once a person earns above this level their total income, up to the annual ceiling, is chargeable to PRSI but they are entitled to a PRSI-free allowance of &euro;127 per week.</P>
        <P>The employee PRSI ceiling is reviewed annually in accordance with the legislative stipulations of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005.  In the 2009 budget the employee ceiling was increased by &euro;1,300 from &euro;50,700 to &euro;52,000; and in the supplementary budget a more substantial increase brought it to &euro;75,036.</P>
        <P>The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund 2005 report, published in 2007, found that paying social insurance contributions represents very good value for money in almost all circumstances.  In particular, the report stated that those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes, with persons earning less than the gross average industrial wage paying 35% of the contributions and receiving 66% of the benefits.</P><Col N="133"/>
        <P>This finding demonstrates the solidarity principle of the social insurance scheme whereby contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits but are instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  It is an expression of solidarity between both earning groups and generations.</P>
        <P>Any future changes to the PRSI ceiling would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Why was the PRSI ceiling not abolished in the budget of 7 April?  Does the Minister accept that the threshold deals only with people who could be regarded as being on reasonably high incomes?  Does she consider that the &euro;19.5 million that could have been achieved with the abolition of the ceiling is not necessary and that there is sufficient funding without it?  Can the Minister give us any good reason it was not abolished in the budget?  I acknowledge that the ceiling was raised in the budget but why was it not abolished? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated, &euro;103.5 million will be raised through the change in the ceiling this year.  Abolition of the ceiling would have to be seen in the context of all other financial measures introduced in the most recent budget including the income levy.  The main aim of that budget with regard to income was to ensure that money was made available to the Exchequer.  Any funding through PRSI would not go to the Exchequer but to the social insurance fund.  It would not have resolved the main problem that we had for that budget.  Raising the ceiling impacted severely on a number of workers and achieved at least the target of &euro;103.5 million but it has to be seen in the overall context of the other measures introduced by the Department of Finance. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>From next year there will be a shortfall in the social insurance budget so it would impact on it.  I smiled when the Minister mentioned solidarity in the social insurance system.  If one takes account of the large cash transfers that are taking place by way of tax relief on private pensions, there would not be too much solidarity to speak about.  One must consider the wider picture.</P>
        <P>With regard to PRSI, it came to my attention recently that certain streams of income are not subject to PRSI and certain anomalies exist.  If a self-employed person has a rental income he or she must pay PRSI on it but if an employed person has rental income he or she does not have to pay PRSI.  Is the Minister aware of this anomaly and does she intend to deal with it?  It would make more sense to target those anomalies rather than hitting the Christmas bonus if she wanted to make savings in the social welfare system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of this specific issue and I will check it out. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister examine the matter?</P>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>What will be the implications for the Department&rsquo;s budget when the social insurance fund runs out? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The important issue is that it will not have any implications for workers or anyone benefiting from claims made under the social insurance fund.  When a deficit arises in the fund, as it inevitably will, the fund will be subvented by the Exchequer.  Sufficient money will, therefore, be available to make pension and other payments which are currently paid from the fund.  This year, the Department&rsquo;s budget is more than &euro;21 billion.  While I hope <Col N="134"/>demand for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and other benefits will decrease next year, the Exchequer will top up the social insurance fund when it becomes necessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I  propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10, 13, 16, 27 and 32 together.</P>
        <P>The live register has increased from 207,100 in May 2008 to 396,871 at the end of May 2009, an unprecedented increase of more than 96%.  I assure the House that staff in the Department are working extremely hard to process claims as expeditiously as is possible, having regard to the conditions of the schemes.</P>
        <P>The average processing time for claims decided in May was 3.68 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and 6.35 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices.  The length of time it takes to process claims varies depending on the complexity of the claim, the availability of the necessary documentation from the applicant or his or her employer and, in the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the need to carry out additional inquires, including assessment of means and whether the claimant satisfies the habitual residence condition.  Furthermore, processing times can vary from office to office for a number of reasons, including increased claim load, the number of staff vacancies, the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office which impacts on the overall level of experience in the office.</P>
        <P>At the end of May, a total 70,363 claims were awaiting a decision, of which 26,437 were jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claims and 43,926 jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims.  This compares to a total of 71,885 awaiting a decision at the end of April.  I am making available tabular statements showing the number of claims awaiting a decision at the end of May and the average processing <Col N="135"/>time for claims decided in May for each local and branch office.  Local offices do not operate strictly within county boundaries and customers can be served by a local office outside their county boundary where the location of the office is more convenient to them.  Consequently, statistics of number of claims awaiting a decision on a county basis are not available.</P>
        <P>As I outlined, as a result of staffing reviews in 2008 and again in recent months, some 300 extra staff have been assigned to local offices, new central support units and the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate since May 2008.  This includes 90 temporary staff who have been appointed to local offices around the country pending the assignment of permanent staff.  Arrangements are also in train to allocate a further 24 inspector posts.</P>
        <P>At the same time, the Department has been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining them wherever possible without compromising our scheme controls.  There has been a significant increase in productivity in local offices during 2009, with almost 251,500 claims for local office schemes decided from January to May 2009 as compared to 146,500 in the same period in 2008.</P>
        <P>As many local offices are very close to capacity as regards accommodating further staff, we have established from 25 May five central decision units in Dublin, Sligo, Finglas, Carrick-on-Shannon and, most recently, Roscommon.  A further central support unit is to be established in Tallaght early next month.</P>
        <P>While acknowledging that some claims are more complicated than others and will, therefore, take longer than the average time to decide, processing times in some areas are still too long.  I assure Deputies we are doing our best to reduce them.  I fully appreciate that becoming unemployed is a very difficult time in a person&rsquo;s life and those who become unemployed need to secure access to financial and other supports as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>While we all know what is involved in processing a claim, these factors do not explain the difference in processing times.  Irrespective of whether average processing times are 19 weeks in one area or two weeks in another area, departmental staff must ask claimants the same questions.  Variations in claimants&rsquo; circumstances do not account for the delays in processing claims. </P><Col N="141"/>
        <P>When we last raised this issue in the House, the five offices with the longest processing times were Boyle, Edenderry, Bandon, Navan and Tuam.  What steps have been taken in these specific local offices to address the long waiting times for claimants?  The shortest processing time in the five offices was 13 weeks, while the longest was 19 weeks.</P>
        <P>Responding to a question by Deputy Shortall, the Minister referred to trying to get in line with targets.  What are the Department&rsquo;s targets?  Is the shortest processing time of two weeks the target for the whole country?  Given that this timeframe is feasible in one office, could a target of two weeks not be achieved in all offices?</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated that if community welfare officers were to be brought under her Department, it would be all sweetness and light &mdash; that expression has stuck since the Ceann Comhairle used it earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased I made an impression on someone.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Difficulties will persist even if the community welfare service comes within the remit of the Department because the service is no longer able to provide the support it did one year ago on account of the increasing number of claimants.  What action will the Minister take to address this matter?   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The target for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is to process 90% of claims within three weeks.  In May, 60% of claims were processed in that timeframe.  The Deputy will note from the tables that processing times in many offices are significantly shorter than three weeks.  In some cases, the average processing time is two weeks, one week or only a few days.  The major problem is not in this area.  The target for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is to process 90% of claims within six weeks.  In May, 65% of claims were decided within that timeframe.</P>
        <P>The figures the Deputy cited for certain offices are correct.  She will note, however, that the offices in question are all branch offices.  In an effort to speed up the processing of claims, applications from some of these branch offices have been transferred for processing in the five special units established recently.  This means claims will no longer lie at the bottom of a pile in a local office.  A further special unit will be established in Tallaght next month.  The creation of a special unit in each region will speed up processing.</P>
        <P>The unfortunate effect of the long processing times in some offices is that they skew the figures for the whole country.  The Deputy asked the reason average processing times were much longer in some areas than in others.  Some of the small offices with few staff have experienced a twofold or threefold increase in the number of claims, depending on local circumstances.  In those areas where we determined that specific issues would arise, we ensured these issues would be addressed by the central units.  I will deal with that matter in a moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made a number of comments on difficulties encountered in improving processing times and indicated the main problems arise in branch offices.  While I accept that major problems are occurring in branch offices, they are not confined to these offices.  A brief examination of the tables supplied shows that six local offices have processing times of ten weeks or more.  What action is being taken to address these unacceptable delays?</P>
        <P>The Minister stated the CPSU objected to her attempt to introduce a system to speed up processing in branch offices.  She also indicated the union objected when the Department sought to extend to other offices same day processing for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit which had been working <Col N="142"/>well in some areas.  It would be helpful if she spelt out precisely what were the problems in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, the Department will examine staffing in local offices that are experiencing problems.  I must be fair to offices throughout the country.  The Deputy asked about offices with the longest processing times.  The Secretary General has also been examining management issues and so forth because these must be considered from an operations perspective, with a view to ensuring people are looked after.</P>
        <P>On the new initiatives, Dundalk introduced an appointment system which has worked well.  Initially there were some objections from the unions, but then they came on board.  That initiative is hugely successful and is being rolled out to 16 different offices.  People go in and are given an appointment time and hatch number and told what documentation they need.  The result is no queues and the protection of the dignity of applicants.  It also ensures staff can build in lunch and break periods.  This works very well.</P>
        <P>The other initiatives mentioned could work very well in the interest of both the staff and the public.  That is the reason I hope the CPSU will agree to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister suggested the CPSU was blocking both initiatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Suffice to say, the agreement with the branch officers goes back to April 2008, but agreement has not been reached with the CPSU on the issue because it says it is outsourcing. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the extraordinary pressure the system is under due to the doubling of the number of unemployed.  I want to focus on the issue of jobseekers, particularly those who were previously self-employed.  There is a major problem in their regard.  There seems to be a degree of enthusiasm among the inspectorate to insist on all sorts of documentation of back income etc.  I understood from a meeting on 13 May that this was being reconsidered and that the current income situation of these people would be the issue.  However, I have not found that happening in the system.  I urge the Minister to take another look at the situation.  Perhaps that would help speed up payments.</P>
        <P>I mentioned a particular case previously and without going into too much detail I will repeat it.  It concerns a person&rsquo;s half-built house being taken into account.  It was valued at &euro;400,000 and this sum was taken into account and used as a basis to refuse a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  This is not on and I urge the Minister to reconsider this type of appraisal.  Perhaps that would then speed up a resolution of the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Crawford raised that issue with me and I am aware there are some issues with regard to the capital valuation being placed on properties.  There have been significant changes and improvements throughout the country with regard to benefits for the self-employed.  It has not been brought to my attention that there is significant difficulty in any individual office, but if there are, particularly in Monaghan, we will check them out.  The procedure has been changed so that inspectors do not look at the projected income based on last year&rsquo;s income in the way they used to. </P>
        <P>Did the Deputy ask another question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>It was only yesterday that I was advised of this issue by the Dundalk office. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="143"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted to mention the value of the central units in making decisions.  When, for example, the SR Technics redundancies came on stream, all of those, instead of going to local offices, went to the Finglas central unit and the decisions were made there.  The same happened in the case of Dell and the applications from there went immediately to Sligo.  These central offices were able to deal with bulk applications efficiently, which freed up the local offices. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to the priority question, the Minister indicated the CPSU was blocking progress on the processing of claims on two different fronts.  She seems to have backtracked on that in the response she has just given. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I gave a separate example. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there an industrial relations issue or not?  Will the Minister clarify the issue with regard to the appointment system, to dealing with long delays in branch offices and to processing being done by departmental staff?  She indicated earlier the CPSU was at fault on those fronts.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister a figure for the current number of staff vacancies?  When will the central support office for Wexford be up and running?  Does the Minister accept there is a need to look at procedures.  Two complaints were brought to my attention recently with regard to a person who had applied for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  A social welfare officer called to the House without an appointment and then had to return the following week.  In the second case, a means assessment was not carried out for somebody on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit until the person&rsquo;s last week on that benefit, another delay.  Does the Minister accept there is potential for tightening the procedures being used?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We recently streamlined procedures for people moving to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance from jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  We have also made an improvement in the IT system, which will generate automatic letters to people before they come to the end of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit so that assessments can be done.  We have also streamlined a process for people who have had a claim in the previous two years, so that if people get a job for a couple of weeks or go to training or F&Aacute;S, the process for dealing with that is better.  Application forms are available on the website so that people can bring them in already completed.  More straightforward procedures have also been introduced for identity checks and improvements have been made in the area of casual work.  There is significant paperwork involved in casual work claims.  We are constantly trying to improve the process and the more we do in this regard the better.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s earlier comments on improvements generally, the two issues which have not been advanced are the agreement with the branch officers on them making decisions locally rather than having forms and applications going to the local office.  This has been agreed with the branch offices, but has not yet been implemented.  That is held up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the CPSU that is holding that up? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I understand, because it is outsourcing from the local office to the branch office.  The second issue on which it has not been possible to make progress was the project that allowed decisions on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to be made on the day.  That had to be stopped and there has been no progress on it.</P>
        <P>Lest the Deputy is confused about what I said, what has progressed is that the appointment system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="144"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I asked about same day processing.  What is the problem with that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Two issues have not progressed and one initiative started and stopped but has now progressed very successfully in 16 different offices.  That is the appointment system and it has the full co-operation of the staff.  Staff in our offices throughout the country are genuinely working flat out.  This can be seen in their productivity.  Some 200,000 claims cleared in one month is extraordinary productivity from staff.  The more we can do to support them in their work, which will ultimately support applicants, is our main aim.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to this issue in a priority question and have raised it several times.  I accept, as most people do, that staff are working flat out.  However, the main concern is the customer, the person who has nothing to live on and is trying to survive.  I have raised an issue with regard to people doing F&Aacute;S courses but have not received a satisfactory answer to my question.  They sign off benefit, sign on with F&Aacute;S and then sign back on with the Department.  That is a waste of staff time.  If this issue was dealt with when it was first raised, it would have freed up time for staff.  When will the Minister stop that process?  Those signing on for F&Aacute;S courses get the same amount of money.  Basically, all the money comes from the same Department, the Department of Finance.  It makes no sense to continue with the same process.  If this issue was tackled, it would immediately free up a significant amount of time for staff.  It might not be enough time to deal with the problem, but it would be useful.  Will we see action on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>What has happened is that claims will be processed more smoothly, given the person made a claim in the previous two weeks.  That issue has been streamlined.  I think what the Deputy is saying is that although the money comes from two different Departments, it all comes from the Exchequer and that these people should not have to make repeated claims.  That has not been changed.  However, we have tried to streamline the process so that applicants can move seamlessly between the two.</P>

        <Qid>8</Qid>
        <asker>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the expected expenditure on mortgage and rent supplements in 2009; the degree to which this is deemed adequate to meet requirements; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23237/09] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Expenditure on rent and mortgage payments has increased significantly in recent years and there are currently over 88,000 recipients of rent supplement and 12,900 recipients of mortgage interest supplement.</P>
        <P>Increased expenditure on these payments is driven not only by rises in the live register but also by an increase in recipients on other schemes such as one-parent family payment and illness related payments.  The estimated number of recipients for both schemes in 2009 was reviewed during preparation of the supplementary budget.  As a result of this analysis, the provision for the rent supplement was increased to &euro;490.4 million, which is &euro;50.7 million more than the 2008 outturn on this scheme.  The allocation for the mortgage interest supplement was also increased, to &euro;40.1m, or &euro;12.5m more than the outturn for 2008.  Expenditure on both schemes is being closely monitored on a monthly basis, taking into account trends in recipient numbers, average monthly payments and savings arising from the supplementary budget measures.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that a recipient may incur.  Setting or retaining maximum rent limits at higher levels than are justified by the open market can have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more <Col N="145"/>general rise in rent levels and in landlord income.  This in turn may worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with a particularly negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent supplementary budget provided for decreases in both the maximum rent payable in respect of new tenancies and in rent supplement payments to existing tenants.  These changes were informed by data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the CSO and a leading property rental website.  It is vital that taxpayers&rsquo; money is not paying inflated rents to private landlords when rental prices in general have dropped considerably.</P>
        <P>Overall, I can assure Deputies that the Government is conscious of the needs of the increasing number of people who are coming to rely on State assistance with their rent and mortgage interest payments.  We have substantially increased provision for these schemes, while also taking steps to ensure that we are not paying landlords excessive rents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Might it be a better policy for the Minister to pursue the possibility of entering into negotiations with her colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, with a view to coming to some arrangement whereby some of the locked-up houses throughout the country at the present time be made available to local authorities to alleviate some of the burden, some &euro;500 million per annum, for rent support?</P>
        <P>It seems extraordinary that at a time when &euro;500 million is being spent on rent support, there are some 80,000 houses locked up, incomplete or vacant in the private sector.  At the same time, the general economic downturn is affecting people to a far greater extent than it would at any other time.  Could the Minister tell us to what extent the funds made available in the supplementary budget have been eroded to date?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is very close co-operation between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Deputy is correct.  It is very frustrating to see houses boarded up when people are in need of housing and are in rented accommodation.  We are working closely with the Department to ensure more people are transferred onto the RAS scheme.  In the last few years, 20,000 people have been transferred onto the scheme and it is working quite successfully.  We are constantly trying to increase the numbers in the scheme.</P>
        <P>Regarding the amount of money currently being spent, I do not have the specific figure but we made provision for additional claims due to the increase in the live register.  I understand it is some &euro;29 million, given the changes in the supplementary budget.  Where there will be pressure is on the mortgage interest supplement, rather than the rent supplement.  We envisage that there will be an overrun on that scheme, but that we will be able to accommodate it within the overall Estimate in the overall budget for the Department this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Olwyn Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding mortgage interest supplement, I am concerned about whether it is efficient.  However, I have a greater concern, namely, the protocol with the bankers&rsquo; federation and the Minister&rsquo;s claim that only nine houses were repossessed in the first quarter of this year.  I am concerned that the Minister is believing the bankers.  The people referred to did not disappear.  They sold their houses so they would not been seen to have had them repossessed or else had some way of meeting their settlement.  The banks did not take such people as far as the High Court and then say, &ldquo;You are all right.  You can stay there&rdquo;.  They still lost their houses, but lost them in a different way.  </P><Col N="146"/>
        <P>I am still not satisfied that mortgage interest supplement is being equitably distributed in terms of how it is decided.  People are still being told they should not have entered into a contract to buy a house because they could not afford it.  They could afford it at the time, but now the price of the house seems disproportionate, whereas two or three years ago it did not.  The issue needs to be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now several months into a mortgage crisis and the Minister has not yet reformed the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  She has promised to reform it, such as the ridiculous rule where if one person is working more than 29 hours, they receive no help whatsoever, irrespective of their circumstances.  When will the Minister announce a reform of the that scheme?</P>
        <P>Regarding people moving from rent supplement to RAS, why is there an 18 month delay in doing that?  Why must they be renting privately for 18 months before they can avail of RAS?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that there should be a waiting time for people who are in rented accommodation before they get what is a priority scheme, that is, RAS.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is it a priority? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are people on housing waiting lists, as the Deputy knows far better than I do, who are in overcrowded accommodation at home but are not in rented accommodation and need to take their place in receiving social housing and the type of housing available for them.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>They would be eligible for private accommodation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>A waiting time is important.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important because I believe it is.  The changes in the supplementary budget are also important, such as the provision that people should have been in rented accommodation for six months or have a full assessment, rather than setting up new households with a view to getting rent supplement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not make any sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It makes total sense because these are important controls.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Durkan asked about the amount spent.  There are currently 88,000 people on rent supplement and 12,720 on mortgage interest supplement.  Deputy Enright mentioned repossessions.  She is correct regarding the repossession orders, but in some cases they are waiting for a lien on the home or building.  I hope the protocol will ensure things will not reach that stage.  We will now be working with sub-prime lenders, who are main culprits, and we will try to ensure they will not take steps towards repossessions.  More and more people are working with MABS.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I was asked to raise this issue by Seamus Rogers, who lives in Donegal, near Derrybeg and Bunbeg and who is a former Donegal county councillor and a very active member of the Labour Party.  I spoke to him yesterday and today about the flooding that affected Derrybeg and Bunbeg.  He told me a lot of damage was done to the area.  A number of bridges were swept away and road surfaces, business premises, houses and a local church were damaged.</P>
        <P>The local library was housed in an old church and a number of book stocks were destroyed.  There is a picture in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the damage to the library, which shows that a great deal of damage was done to books.  A lot of public property was damaged, according to the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Access to some local households was destroyed.  People have been affected and families&rsquo; homes have been water damaged.  It is lucky nobody was badly injured or worse.</P>
        <P>Deputy Dinny McGinley also raised this matter.  When I spoke to him earlier, he was on his way home to assess the damage.  From newspaper reports, I know he wanted an audit of the damage to be carried out and for a Minister to visit the area to assess it.  The Minister responsible will know from the reports and from their local representatives that there has been damage.  I understand the Donegal county manager was on Radio na Gaeltachta today and told the interviewer that while Donegal County Council can carry out temporary repairs, for example, to the bridges that have been destroyed, there would only be funding for stop-gap <Col N="148"/>measures.  He said funding from Government was needed if further measures were to be implemented.</P>
        <P>What funding will be made available to Donegal County Council to carry out the works and repair the damage that has been caused by this flooding and when will it be provided?  When will the decisions be taken with regard to this funding?  Obviously, the council will need to know in order to make its own decisions on its response to the flooding and the damage caused.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, information at this stage with regard to funding that would be available and individuals who have suffered damage in their homes and so on because of the flooding?  I would appreciate an update in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to come to the House to discuss the severe flooding which occurred in the Gweedore Gaeltacht area in County Donegal on 23 June 2009.  It is ironic that this flooding took place at a time when most of the rest of the country was basking in sunshine.  The Donegal fire service has described the weather as freakish.  My colleague, Deputy Martin Mansergh, Minister of State with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, is very much aware of the hardship and loss suffered as a result of flooding and is pleased, through me, to have the opportunity to place on the record of the House his personal sympathy and concern and that of the Government for the victims of the flooding.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has visited the scenes of flooding in many parts of the country where severe flooding has occurred and has first-hand knowledge of the hardship and worry that flooding causes.  The Minister of State and the Office of Public Works are acutely aware of the impacts of flooding and are committed to doing all they can to alleviate them both through the provision of defences to best practice standards to reduce existing flood risk and by taking steps to prevent the creation of future risk.  This is not the time to go into detail on those matters as time is limited and the topic under discussion is the flooding in the Gweedore area.</P>
        <P>The OPW engineering staff met on site with engineering staff from Donegal County Council on 24 June 2009.  A combination of spring tides together with prolonged torrential rain on 23 June contributed to flooding in lower level lands.  The heavy rain commenced at approximately 3 p.m. and continued unabated for a period of about four hours.  Eight county road bridges were damaged &mdash; mainly parapet, soffit and scouring damage &mdash; and four private bridges were also damaged.  Two of these private bridges serve blocks of six or nine houses approximately.  Parts of county roads were washed away or suffered surface damage along the course of the channel.  Among the buildings flooded were a craft shop, a flower shop and the old church at Derrybeg, which now houses the Gweedore library.  A number of private properties were also flooded and more details in regard to the precise number affected are awaited.  These are preliminary findings and the process of gathering further information is ongoing.  It is hoped that a preliminary report will be available shortly and an early meeting will be set up between Donegal County Council and OPW officials to assess what can be done to prevent any recurrence.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is conscious that in addition to the trauma caused by the flooding, people also suffered financial loss arising from the damage to their property.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs has responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance where it is considered appropriate and is providing help through the community welfare officer network to victims of the recent flooding.  Where people are suffering hardship they should contact the local community welfare officer for assistance and each case will be dealt with confidentially <Col N="149"/>and on its merits.  Recent humanitarian assistance schemes have not extended to cover business or agriculture.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the community welfare officers, is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  Under the legislation governing the scheme, the HSE may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need to people on social welfare or health service executive payments.  This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person&rsquo;s basic income.</P>
        <P>Assistance in the form of an urgent needs payment can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance, to assist, for example, in cases of flood damage with immediate needs such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and perhaps shelter.  Assistance can be provided to people affected in cash or in kind.</P>
        <P>There is no automatic entitlement to these payments.  Each application is determined on the particular circumstances of the case.  In assessing income, consideration is given as to whether a person is in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment or to the gross household income with allowance made as appropriate under normal supplementary welfare allowance means assessments.  This Department&rsquo;s role in response to the flooding primarily involves supporting the community welfare service in the provision of exceptional needs and urgent needs funding in the short term and other supports, where applicable, to cater for the long-term effects of the flooding.  Any support given relates to damage to a person&rsquo;s home or loss of essential items.  It does not extend to business or commercial losses.  Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted.  Any person who is experiencing hardship should contact his or her local community welfare office.</P>
        <P>The two community welfare officers in the area are aware of the situation in Gweedore as they both live locally.  However, they have not as yet been asked to provide assistance to any individuals affected by the flooding.  My understanding, from discussing the situation with the community welfare staff in the area, is that the damage incurred is mainly structural to businesses, and structural damage to a number of roads and bridges has also occurred.  A number of water facilities may also have been damaged.  The community welfare officers have also stated that a number of representatives from Donegal County Council have been examining the situation and are due to visit Gweedore again this evening to assess the damage and report back to their parent Department.</P>
        <P>I can assure the House that the Office of Public Works will continue to work in partnership with Donegal County Council to try to alleviate the risk of future flooding in Gweedore and the surrounding areas.  I will conclude by again expressing my sympathy to the victims of the flooding in Gweedore and the surrounding areas and assuring them of the Government&rsquo;s support for the work that is already under way to provide reassurance to them in regard to risk in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I am thankful to have the opportunity to raise the report of the committee of inquiry to review care and treatment practices in St. Michael&rsquo;s unit, South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Clonmel included in the quality and planning of care and the use of restraint and seclusion, and to report to the Mental Health Commission.  I will deal with one small but important area of the comprehensive and detailed report.</P>
        <P>The clinical risk manager reviewed fractures recorded in St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Clonmel from July 2002 to 31 January 2004.  The regional risk manager calculated that, at the time of the <Col N="150"/>September 2004 report, the risk of residents of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital or St. Michael&rsquo;s unit sustaining a fracture was between two and three times higher than the average risk of residents of the other psychiatric hospitals in the region.</P>
        <P>The fractures in Clonmel were of small bones in hands and feet and fractures to the upper end of the humerus differed from the number and type of fractures seen in the other units where fractures of the hip and wrist are as a result of falls from bed and falls on an outstretched hand.  The report referred to the fact that most patients are cared for in wards which are permanently locked and where there is restriction of movement.  A number of patients are elderly frail and vulnerable.  The report stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">There is a lack of rationale for combining patients with different diagnoses i.e. patients with challenging behaviour and frail patients.  The resulting patient mix means that some patients are at risk of injury from other patients.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is a cause of concern that this review highlighted many other incidents of fractures occurring in these specific patients in the past.  In some situations, old fractures or healing fractures were identified coincidently on X-ray.  The report went on to state that a worrying observation made during the course of this review was that in 18 of the 19 incidents involving fractures the documentation states that they were not witnessed.  In the remaining one, it is unclear whether there were any witnesses.  Two of the 19 residents each had fractures on two occasions during the 18 month period and five of the residents suffered earlier fractures.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A retrospective examination of the charts of the patients of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital showed that in many cases there was no documented supporting history of injury, trauma or signs or symptoms to account for the previously undiagnosed fractures.  On 15 July 2005, a meeting of senior managers and clinicians was held to consider the report.  The meeting was not minuted.  Many of those attending were unclear about the authority of the meeting.  At the meeting the regional risk manager outlined the findings of the report and indicated that there was a strong possibility of non-accidental injury.  The possibility of informing the Garda was considered.  The need for further investigation into the causes of the injuries and the very high proportion of unobserved injuries was discussed and generally agreed.  However the matter was not reported to the Garda and no effective action was taken on foot of the risk manager&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>No minutes of the meeting were kept or circulated and no follow-up meeting was arranged.  Those attending the meeting expected it would lead to the development of an action plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the report but discussion about how this would be achieved, whether through further investigation or a review of clinical and organisational practice, was not concluded.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission inquiry report makes the following observations in regard to the investigation into the fractures: &ldquo;Taking into account the lack of further investigation following the September 2004 report, the limited implementation of its recommendations and the extreme slowness of the process, the inquiry team considers that the safety and welfare of residents was not given the highest priority.&rdquo;  The inquiry team believes that, where the safety and welfare of residents appears to be at risk, prompt action is required.  Further investigation to clarify the level of risk and implementation of measures aimed at reducing the risk is necessary.  The inquiry team believes that the lack of urgency of the process following the September 2004 report, the lack of further investigation to clarify the level of risk to residents and the failure to implement many of the report&rsquo;s recommendations indicate that the safety and welfare of residents was not given the highest priority.  The inquiry team believes that this was probably <Col N="151"/>influenced by industrial relations problems, a concern to avoid bad publicity and potential for distress.</P>
        <P>Patients and their families should feel safe and when one considers that only one of the 19 injuries uncovered in September 2004 was witnessed by the staff, it is of great concern.  The failure to refer the matter to the Garda following consideration smacks of a cover up.  The risk of sustaining a fracture in St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital was between two and three times higher than that of the local psychiatric hospital which highlights the seriousness of the level of injury.  The welfare of the patients continues to be of concern and will only be satisfied by the closure of the hospital and the transfer of patients to modern hospital conditions.</P>
        <P>This hospital was recommended for closure because of the conditions.  I have only referred to a section of the report, which contains details of the conditions which prevail but we do not have time to go further into the detail today.  If these conditions applied to any other group of patients, there would be a three hour debate in the D&aacute;il on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this important matter, to which I will reply on behalf of my colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney.</P>
        <P>The report made for very difficult reading, highlighting significant deficiencies in the mental health services in Clonmel.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, requested that I mention that the publication last April of the report on St. Luke&rsquo;s and St. Michael&rsquo;s represented one of his lowest points since he was appointed Minister of State for with responsibility for equality, disability issues and mental health.</P>
        <P>To put the report into context, in June 2007 the Mental Health Commission established an inquiry under section 55 of the Mental Health Act 2001 to review care and treatment practices in St. Michael&rsquo;s Unit, South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel, and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Clonmel, including the quality and planning of care and the use of restraint and seclusion.</P>
        <P>The inquiry was established in the light of concerns regarding services in Clonmel which had been identified in several annual reports of the inspector of mental health services.  The report found that individual, person-centred care was not at the heart of the system in Clonmel and this was attributed to staffing and environmental constraints, as well as outdated practices.  The report also pointed to a lack of clear leadership and a shared sense of purpose and concluded that the safety and welfare of residents had not been given sufficient priority.</P>
        <P>While the Government fully accepts the findings and recommendations in the report and readily admits that aspects of the service provision described in the report are totally unacceptable in a modern mental health service, the publication of the report demonstrates the robustness of the Mental Health Act 2001, the independence of the Mental Health Commission and the importance of its role in safeguarding the standards and quality of care in the mental health services.  It is clear the systems put in place by the 2001 Act to promote high standards and good practices in our mental health services are working.  Unacceptable standards and practices can no longer be swept under the carpet and tolerated; deficiencies must and will be addressed.</P>
        <P>In terms of Clonmel, the Mental Health Commission and the HSE have held several meetings on the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  It is anticipated that a detailed project plan for the development of the mental health services in south Tipperary, which will be time bound and have clear lines of responsibility for implementation, will be finalised in the coming weeks.  I am informed that the Inspector of Mental Health Services will monitor closely the HSE project plan and report to the Mental Health Commission on a regular basis.  The Mental <Col N="152"/>Health Commission has now attached conditions under the Mental Health Act 2001 to the continued operation of St. Michael&rsquo;s and St. Luke&rsquo;s as approved centres.</P>
        <P>Since the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s inquiry team visited Clonmel in autumn 2007, progress has been made in making service users partners in their own care, providing more services in the community, reducing hospital admissions and providing more home-based treatments and outreach services.</P>
        <P>In line with the recommendations for the closure of the old psychiatric hospitals in A Vision for Change, it is proposed to close St. Luke&rsquo;s in 2010.  The closure will take place on a phased basis with wards closing sequentially and the hospital can only finally close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings.  However, I am satisfied that plans are well advanced for the complete closure of the hospital by December 2010.  I understand some wards have already closed and the number of residents in the hospital has reduced.  A further two wards are due for closure this year.  All current residents will be provided with care in more appropriate settings as identified through multi-disciplinary assessments, in partnership with the residents and their families and carers.  Also, as wards close, staff will re-deploy to community-based teams which will further enhance services in the community.</P>
        <P>The focal point of modern mental health services is the community and developing a community-based service is the way forward.  To that end, extended hours services are now available in both Cashel and Clonmel, providing more accessibility.  The extension and renovation of the Morton Street Day Centre has been completed and is availed of by more than 20 service users daily.  Such initiatives whereby supports are provided in the community will, it is anticipated, greatly reduce the need for hospital admission and will help service users to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that the Government continues to be fully committed to the improvement of mental services, not only in Clonmel, but throughout the country, through the implementation of A Vision for Change.  The deficiencies in the services in Clonmel have been identified and these deficiencies will be addressed by the HSE and closely monitored by the inspector of mental health services.</P>

      <sTitle>Special Educational Needs.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Recently, I received a letter from the board of management, parents council, staff and principal of St. Ita&rsquo;s and St. Joseph&rsquo;s School, Balloonagh, Tralee, and I will read the contents of the letter into the record:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Board of Management, Parents Council, staff and Principal of the above school are deeply concerned at the delay currently experienced by graduates from the school in being offered places for further education and training in the Kerry area.  We regard this delay is as an unnecessary source of stress on the students and their parents; as this seems to be an annual problem we urge those involved to adequately fund the various service providers so that a seamless transition from school to further education and training can take place.  As the number of students involved in the transition from school is generally low (10/12) we believe this issue should be addressed by the H.S.E. to avoid the stress, confusion and delay presently experienced by the students and their parents.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I also received an e-mail from concerned parents on behalf of their son which states: &ldquo;Our son had been accepted for a place in Kerry Parents and Friends, Listowel.  We went to the Kerry Parents and Friends AGM last week.  The chief executive stated there was no funding for <Col N="153"/>school leavers for 2009.&rdquo;  It was also pointed out there was a shortfall of 1.4 million for the Kerry Cork area.  The parents were subsequently told by the manager with responsibility for intellectual disability in the HSE south region that there were approximately 96 people with no placement for September.  This is certainly a disgrace.  The e-mail continues:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">At this moment we do not know where James will be in September.  This is quite stressful for us going into the summer.  James had 12 wonderful years in Nano Nagle school, Listowel which come to an end at the end of June.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There is a feeling of powerlessness at this stage because it is not known what will happen to James in September.  The three schools most affected are Nano Nagle special school, Listowel, St. Ita&rsquo;s and St. Joseph&rsquo;s school, Tralee, and St. Francis school in Beaufort.  The service-providers taking children from these schools are Kerry Parents and Friends centres in Listowel and Killarney, the National Learning Network in Tralee, which is funded by F&Aacute;S and has only four places available this year, and St. John of God.  A total of 34 referrals have come from those three schools alone.  The schools cannot keep them once they reach 18 years. This means that 34 young people who are now 18 years will have to leave education.</P>
        <P>As a former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin will know that the students will regress if not placed in a training or educational situation.  It also places significant stress on their families.  The parents may both be out working or the parent at home may have to provide continuous care.  The centres have no capacity due to cutbacks.  There is no flexibility nor additional capacity to facilitate these students.</P>
        <P>I am aware that we are here at 8.15 p.m. in the evening and this Adjournment matter may not have much impact but if the service-providers are not given the adequate funding they require, I ask that an exception be made for the special schools to allow them keep pupils who are over 18 years for an additional year.  It could be referred to as a transitional year in which the students could undertake work experience and other activities.  This might be one way of helping them to overcome this problem.</P>
        <P>The age of 18 is the cut-off point in special schools and this is wrong, especially if there is no other placement for the students.  Children in mainstream education can stay on longer.  If this situation was repeated for children in mainstream education there would be an outcry but nobody seems to be concerned about these children, who are special children. The parents do not know where their children will be going in September and nobody seems to care.  This is a significant issue of blatant discrimination between parents of special children and parents of children in mainstream education. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter and apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who could not be present.  I am pleased to have been given the opportunity by the Deputy to clarify the position with regard to the matter raised by him.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science funds post-school provision for young adults, including those with a disability, generally through multiple providers, which include universities, post-leaving certificate courses, vocational training centres and national learning networks.  In addition, vocational educational committees provide grant assistance to some service-providers within the health service towards an education component of its provision through the co-operation hours scheme.</P>
        <P>There are currently 23 vocational training centres and approximately 34 national learning network centres throughout the country.  They provide a service to approximately 1,300 young adults with a disability.  Two of these facilities are located in County Kerry.  Young adults <Col N="154"/>attending the vocational training centres typically have a diagnosis of mild or moderate general learning disability and are unsuited to open training centres.  Participants must be under 25 and they attend for a maximum three years&rsquo; duration.  Department officials have contacted the Health Service Executive in the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s inquiry with regard to  its responsibility for young adults with special educational needs who are over 18 years.  The HSE has advised that approximately 30 school leavers have been identified by the Kerry occupational guidance service of the HSE for training and day-care places.  The HSE is currently working with service-providers to ensure that the individuals in question have access to services in September 2009 in the context of the available funding.  The HSE intends communicating with the individuals or their parents or guardians, as appropriate, within the next ten to 14 days, to confirm the arrangements for each individual for September.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities may also avail of adult literacy courses provided by the VECs around the country.  The Deputy may also be familiar with the back to education initiative which provides part-time further education programmes for adults to give them an opportunity to combine a return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities.  People with disabilities are one of the target groups of the programme.  The BTEI programme is a part-time initiative for learners who wish to pursue part-time or modular programmes.  Under the BTEI, a programme may be offered for as little as one hour per week or as much as 17 hours per week, depending on the needs and demands of the prospective learners.  It is recommended that programme duration for individual learners, class contact hours, not exceed 400 hours per annum, over a twelve-month period.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position with regard to the matter raised by him.  I hope the issues are resolved shortly in the interests of those young people and their families.</P>

	<P>As many local offices are very close to capacity as regards accommodating further staff, earlier this year the Department commenced the process of establishing a number of central decision units around the country. These units are being staffed primarily by the redeployment of existing civil servants from other Government Departments. The current remit of the units is to support local offices in the decision making process for jobseeker claims. </P>
        <P>Four such units have been set up in Dublin, Sligo, Finglas, Carrick-on-Shannon and are currently operational. The units have been concentrating on deciding claims from the offices with the highest volume of claims awaiting a decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A further unit was established on 25th May in Roscommon and another unit is to be set up in Tallaght in early July.</P>
        <P>There is a significant training overhead associated with staff coming into local offices due to the complex nature of the jobseekers schemes. This is particularly so when a person is coming from another department and may not have any Social Welfare background whatsoever. While a certain amount of formal training is provided, the bulk of the training is &ldquo;on-the-job&rdquo;. It takes many months for a deciding officer to get up to speed with all the various aspects of the schemes administered in local offices. In the meantime they rely on assistance from their more experienced colleagues to guide them in the learning process. Consequently, there is a certain amount of lost productivity while new staff acquire the necessary expertise of experienced deciding officers.</P>
        <P>As I previously outlined the support units are being staffed by the redeployment of existing civil servants, therefore the Department can only establish such units in locations where <Col N="156"/>sufficient numbers of staff can be sourced and suitable accommodation is available. The Department continues to liaise with other Government Departments in an attempt to secure staff to establish a unit in Wexford. As of now a date has not been confirmed for the establishment of this unit.</P>

	<P>Since May 2008, some 300 extra staff have been assigned to local offices, new Central Support Units and the Departments Inspectorate.  Of these 150 have been assigned since January 2009 as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />16 Social Welfare Inspectors were assigned in March 2009 to various locations around the country to undertake means testing and other work associated with processing claims for the jobseekers allowance. </P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />49 posts have also been assigned to date for Local Office Central Support Units in 5 locations.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />And some 90 temporary staff have been appointed to Local Offices around the country pending the assignment of permanent staff. </P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The new inspectors and staff for the support units were sourced by the redeployment or lateral transfer of serving Civil Servants either within the Department or from other Government Departments.</P>
        <P>Work is in progress to source a further 150 posts, including 24 additional social welfare inspectors, from within the civil service.</P>
        <P>In providing extra staffing, both directly to the local offices and to the new support units, the focus has been on supporting local offices that are under the most pressure in terms of claim loads and processing times.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that waiting times are still too long in some areas and I assure the House that we are doing our best to reduce them.</P>
        <P>In addition to providing extra staff, we have also been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining our procedures wherever possible without, of course, compromising scheme controls.</P>
        <P>Examples of process improvement initiatives that have been introduced include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The introduction of an appointment system in some offices for customers making a jobseekers claim;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A simplified process for people who had a claim in the previous 2 years; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseekers allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires.</P><Col N="157"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps reduce queuing times.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputies that my Department is working hard to ensure that the remaining extra posts required are filled as soon possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 26 and 35 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that during 2008 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks. However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks. These processing times replicate those for 2007 notwithstanding the fact that there was an increase of 27% in the number of appeals received during 2008.</P>
        <P>The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases and further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required. Circumstances may also arise, normally outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals. For example, delays can occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings. In some cases adjournments may be sought by the appellant or his/her representative.</P>
        <P>Having said that, however, I am concerned about processing times for appeals being further increased especially as the Social Welfare Appeals Office has informed me that they anticipate a further increase of some 18% in the number of appeals they expect to receive during 2009. Having regard to the current level of appeals awaiting determination, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in January. Furthermore, in the light of the current situation, I am advised that the Chief Appeals Officer is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals having regard to due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>
        <P>While improving processing times remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, it is necessary at all times, given the quasi-judicial nature of the appeals process, to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the number of people claiming rent supplement for more than 18 months; her views on the slow transfer of people from rent supplement onto the rental accommodation scheme; the action she has taken to address this problem; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are currently almost 88,800 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment &mdash; an increase of 49% since the end of 2007. Over half of these recipients have been in payment for more than one year, while over 32,000 have been in payment for 18 months or more. </P>
        <P>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities. Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, RAS.</P>
        <P>Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DoEHLG) indicate that to date, local authorities have transferred over 10,600 rent supplement cases to RAS units. Housing authorities have also transferred a further 9,400 recipients to other social housing options, a total of over 20,000 transfers since 2005. Almost 7,000 recipients were transferred in 2008.</P>
        <P>It is accepted that progress in relation to RAS was initially slower than expected. However the pace of delivery has improved significantly, and in 2009 a target has been set of transferring an additional 7,000 households from rent supplement.</P>
        <P>In addition to this official target, due to the numbers of unsold affordable stock around the country, an opportunity has been created to make use of some of these properties for RAS and it is expected that additional transfers will occur in 2009 above that provided for by the 2009 target. The position regarding the availability of property is monitored on an ongoing basis, given the current market conditions, if further savings are achieved and there may be an opportunity to achieve further transfers.</P>
        <P>The changes made in Budget 2009 to better align the minimum weekly contribution required from tenants under the rent supplement scheme with that under the RAS should also encourage more people to take up RAS offers.</P>
        <P>The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 28 together.</P>
        <P>In the context of very tough decisions having to be made across the whole range of Government expenditure, the provision of &euro;21.3 billion for social welfare services in 2009 &mdash; 20% more than the amount spent in 2008 &mdash; is a clear demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the vulnerable and providing income support to the increasing numbers of people who are losing their jobs.</P>
        <P>Both taxes and borrowing had to be increased in the Budget to pay for rising welfare expenditure in 2009.</P>
        <P>Over the past decade there have been very significant increases in welfare payments with Child benefit increasing from &euro;44 to &euro;166 per month; State contributory pension increasing from &euro;113 to more than &euro;230 per week and the weekly rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance being raised from &euro;93 to &euro;204 per week.</P>
        <P>In the context of the current economic circumstances, it has been necessary for the Government to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure in order to restore order and stability in the public finances. This has involved reviewing all public expenditure programmes, including social welfare programmes, which at some &euro;21.3 billion in 2009 form a substantial portion of overall public expenditure.</P>
        <P>In order to avoid cutting all the weekly social welfare payment rates while trying to keep the welfare budget at a level the State can afford, it has been necessary to discontinue funding for the Christmas bonus that is usually paid to certain welfare recipients.</P>
        <P>The payment of a 100% Christmas bonus in 2009 would cost an estimated &euro;223 million.</P>
        <P>In deciding on how to achieve savings of &euro;300 million in the welfare budget, there were no easy options. Everything had to be considered &mdash; including a cut in the weekly rates of payments to all welfare recipients.</P>
        <P>This would have meant taking money off everyone straight away &mdash; with little advance notice. It also would have involved the recall of all social welfare payment books, with the distress which that would have caused, especially for older people.</P>
        <P>In the end, the Government felt that instead of doing this it would be fairer to give people almost nine months notice that the Christmas bonus will not be paid.</P>
        <P>In making this decision, the Government was of course aware that it would be difficult for people but they felt that the alternative of cutting all weekly payments would have a much greater affect on households. It was not an easy decision. It was not a choice that was taken lightly. But it was felt that it was the fairest option.</P>
        <P>Even with the Christmas bonus amounting to a 2% cut in the annual social welfare income of long-term welfare recipients, it should be remembered that the October budget provided for increases of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic payment rates. At that time inflation for 2009 was expected to be 2.5%. It is now considered that deflation is more likely in 2009, with a 4% drop in the Consumer Price Index now expected.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 19 and 55 together.</P>
        <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems. There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local services throughout the country. In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8 pm, Monday to Friday, at lo-call number 1890 283 438 and budgeting and money management information can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie . The MABS advises that people coping with debt difficulties should make an approach to the MABS, via any of these channels. This can be the first positive step in addressing debt difficulties.</P>
        <P>In 2009, almost &euro;18 million has been provided to fund the MABS. Additional investment in recent years has strengthened the capacity of the MABS to deal with increased demand for service.</P>
        <P>There are now 252 money advice staff employed throughout the country and the Telephone Helpline has been strengthened to provide an immediate response to clients seeking information and advice. Applications for extra resources from individual MABS companies are subject to funding being made available and are kept under review.</P>
        <P>All MABS companies operate an appointments system for meeting clients. Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and dealt with promptly. Cases that are less urgent are referred to the Telephone Helpline and to the website for immediate assistance with budgeting and money management issues. The Telephone Helpline can now handle less complex straight forward single debt cases such as threatened utility disconnections and deals directly with the ESB and An Bord Gais in relation to these cases. Over 90% of callers to the Helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline advisor. In addition, the Telephone Helpline assists local services to manage their appointment lists by providing an initial MABS service to clients and ongoing support while they await their appointment with their local money advisor.</P>
        <P>Information is not collected centrally on the waiting times for appointments at different MABS offices throughout the country. Local services monitor their waiting times for appointments and, where required, seek guidance and assistance in managing their caseload from MABS NDL, the national support company.</P>
        <P>MABS NDL has introduced a number of community education and other management support initiatives to assist the local services with their increased caseloads. These include an education programme for people facing redundancy to inform them about managing on a reduced income and how to avoid getting into debt. MABS NDL is continuing to develop the MABSIS to improve the statistical information available in relation to the national and local services and trends in the debt among MABS Clients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to expand the current free telephone rental scheme by providing for free broadband for older people. The Department is examining how best to implement this commitment. As a first step it has been agreed that where people access the internet using a landline, the telephone allowance can be used to cover the cost of calls or internet usage up to the level of their allowance. In addition if a person wishes to subscribe to a bundled package for telephone and internet, the telephone allowance can be applied to this package. </P>
        <P>The telephone allowance is a component of the household benefits package which also includes the electricity/gas allowance and free television license schemes. The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare payment or who satisfy a means test. It is also available to people aged under 66 who are in receipt of certain social welfare disability payments or carer&rsquo;s allowance. In 2008, over 370,000 people received the household benefits at a cost of &euro;340 million.</P>
        <P>The primary objective of the telephone allowance scheme is to ensure that vulnerable people have access to help in an emergency and to provide an element of security. A secondary objective is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</P>
        <P>The Department will continue to keep this issue under review and consideration will be given to expanding access for older people to broadband as the opportunity arises.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 24 and 53 together.</P>
        <P>There are currently almost 88,800 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 49% since the end of December 2007. The recent Supplementary Budget provided that the weekly minimum contribution towards rent be increased from &euro;18 to &euro;24 a week, with effect from 1 June 2009. It also provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date. While tenants may be contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally.</P><Col N="162"/>
        <P>The most recent data published by the CSO shows that rents in the private sector have fallen by almost 11% since November 2008 and by almost 20% in the past year. A leading property website also reported recently that rents had fallen by almost 16% in the twelve months to March 2009 and that in the same period rents in all major urban areas had fallen, ranging from a fall of 10% in Galway, 15% in Cork and between 12.5% and 18% in Dublin.</P>
        <P>It is essential that state support for tenants who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices.</P>

        <P>Facilitators work closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies at national and local level, to identify appropriate training and developmental programmes for social welfare recipients of working age to enhance the skills those individuals have and ultimately improve their employments chances as well as help them to develop personally.</P>
        <P>The facilitator service is available to social welfare customers at all local offices. Facilitators hold open clinics and meet with people who have been referred either by the social welfare local office or by other agencies. Appointments to see the facilitator can be made by contacting the social welfare local office or the facilitator directly. In addition, cases are selected and referred to facilitators by employment support section.</P><Col N="163"/>
        <P>The service was enhanced under the National Development Plan (NDP) Social and Economic Participation Programme. There are currently 60 facilitators in place, with a further 10 due for appointment, bringing the total in place to 70.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate the demand for the facilitator service is elevated. Waiting times to see a facilitator vary nationwide and information on waiting times for individual facilitators are not available.

	<P>There are currently almost 88,800 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 49% since the end of December 2007.  The recent Supplementary Budget provided that the weekly minimum contribution payable towards rent be increased from &euro;18 to &euro;24 a week, with effect from 1 June 2009. It also provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date. Other changes in the Supplementary Budget provided that new maximum rent limits apply to all new claimants, from 1 June 2009, to reflect the general reductions in private sector rent levels. </P>
        <P>The most recent data published by the CSO, shows that rents in the private sector have fallen by almost 11% since November 2008 and by almost 20% in the past year.  It is essential therefore that state support for tenants who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices.</P>
        <P>Existing recipients of rent supplement were advised by letter in advance of the change being made to their rent payment from 1 June 2009 and this communication can be shown to landlords as evidence of the revised rent supplement in payment in individual cases. Landlords were advised through advertising in national and provincial newspapers of the general reduction in rent supplement payments. Given prevailing rental market trends and availability of rental properties, landlords were asked in the advertising to respond positively to tenants who present the Department&rsquo;s letter seeking a reduction in rent.  A number of organisations representing landlords and tenants were contacted and advised of the changes to the rent supplement scheme.</P>
        <P>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, once a tenancy is at least a year old and where the rent has not been reviewed for twelve months, the tenant is entitled to ask a landlord to review the rent in payment where the tenant feels that the rent exceeds the market rate for the property.  While tenants may be contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally.  In this climate, it is expected that people should be able to source alternative accommodation at the appropriate rental level if a landlord is unwilling to reduce the rent in any particular case.</P>
        <P>Community Welfare Officers have discretion to provide assistance where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case.  Officers have been advised that support, appropriate to the <Col N="164"/>circumstances of the particular case, may be provided to rent supplement tenants for up to two months, while alternative accommodation is being sourced within the existing rent limits.</P>

	<P>The mortgage interest supplement scheme is designed to help those who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayment schedule where their means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme provides a short-term &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; within the overall social welfare scheme to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment. </P>
        <P>A supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest only to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.</P>
        <P>There are currently 12, 900 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 213% over the number in payment at end 2007.</P>
        <P>The assessment for the existing mortgage interest supplement scheme provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.</P>
        <P>The current review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is progressing. The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence. Legislative and operational issues arising in the existing mortgage interest scheme are being examined, including the cap on hours of employment.</P>
        <P>The views of the community welfare service and other interested parties are currently being canvassed as part of the review. In the interim, updated guidelines on the operation of the existing mortgage interest supplement scheme have issued to community welfare service staff. The full review should be completed and a final report available by the end of 2009.</P>

	<P>Under the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to availing of a range of employment, training and educational options.  The NEAP is not confined to particular geographical areas. </P>
        <P>The back to education allowance is designed to facilitate people of working age on welfare payments to return to education in order to gain qualifications which will help to enhance their employment prospects.  The main incentives for jobseekers to avail of the scheme are that it <Col N="165"/>exempts them from the requirement to be available for work while participating in an approved course of education and, in addition, an annual &euro;500 cost of education allowance is payable.  Participants may continue to receive any secondary benefits to which they have been entitled.</P>
        <P>Changes to provide for earlier access to the scheme were announced in the recent supplementary budget.  In order to qualify for participation an applicant must now be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to 9 months for those who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with the Department&rsquo;s facilitator programme.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>Each claimant for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment is given information when they make their claim that, among other things, lists the range of employment support services operated by the department.  This includes the back to education allowance scheme.   The relevant information and booklets are also available in each of the department&rsquo;s local offices.  Information on the range of employment supports is also available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Jobseeker claimants are also advised about the department&rsquo;s facilitator service which is available to help them explore the range of work and educational options available.</P>
        <P>In May, 2009, the department issued an information leaflet to all people under 25 who were more than 3 months on the live register to advise them of the education supports available.</P>
        <P>The government has devoted significant resources to the back to education allowance over the years.  In view of its important role in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers, the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 45 and 52 together.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2008, there were 1,351 defined benefit schemes subject to the funding standard.  Current estimates suggest that approximately 90% of defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit.  However, the full extent of the level of under-funding will not be fully apparent until all schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board.</P>
        <P>The Government is conscious of the pressures on both sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees, arising from the significant losses incurred by pension funds over the last 18 months.  We are anxious to ensure, in so far as we can, that those involved have sufficient time and space to fully assess the implications of the current difficulties for their schemes and the remedial action they can take.  Indeed, this was the thinking behind the recent implementation of a number of measures to ease the pressures being felt by many pension funds.  Those measures included the granting of extra time for schemes to formulate funding proposals and allowing longer periods for recovery plans.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, changes to the Pensions Act 1990 were introduced by the 2009 Social Welfare and Pensions Act which allowed for the restructuring of underfunded schemes; to ensure a more equitable distribution of assets in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit scheme <Col N="167"/>and to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board in ensuring that pension contributions deducted from wages and salaries are remitted by employers to scheme trustees.  These changes will not have any cost implications for the exchequer.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, I also introduced, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, the Pensions Insolvency Payments Scheme (PIPS) to reduce the cost of purchasing pension payments, by trustees of pension schemes in deficit, where the employer has become insolvent.  Although the operation of the PIPS is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, the scheme will be established on a cost-neutral basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The live register has increased to unprecedented levels as a result of the economic downturn that the country is currently experiencing.  Staff and management of the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working flat out to deal with this increased claim load and to minimise the time taken to decide claims.</P>
        <P>The length of time it takes to process claims varies depending on the complexity of the claim, the availability of the necessary documentation from the applicant or his/her employer and the need to carry out additional inquires including the assessment of means and whether the claimant satisfies the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, processing times can vary from area to area for a number of reasons including the extent of the increased number of claims, the number of staff vacancies, the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff which impacts on the overall level of experience in an area.  It is recognised that the provision of additional staff in itself will not deal with the rising claimload.  Since early 2008 we have been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining them wherever possible without, of course, compromising our scheme controls.</P>
        <P>During 2008 the need for some 150 additional posts was identified in order to respond to the significant increase in the number of people applying for jobseekers payments in particular.  Staff were sourced during 2008 and the early part of 2009 to meet this requirement.  With the live register continuing to increase, the Department has requested more than 300 extra posts in 2009, in addition to those already mentioned. Of these:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />49 posts have being assigned to date for Local Office Central Support Units in 5 locations.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />And some 90 temporary staff have been appointed to Local Offices around the country pending the assignment of permanent staff.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition to increased staffing for local offices, the number of Social Welfare inspectors was increased by 16 earlier this year to undertake means testing of claims for social assistance payments including jobseekers allowance, farm assist and carers allowance.  More recently it has been decided to assign a further 24 Inspectors and the necessary arrangements are in train to have these posts filled.</P><Col N="168"/>
        <P>To qualify for farm assist a person must satisfy a means test.  These cases take longer to process as all such cases require a home visit by a Social Welfare inspector.  Further delays may arise if the farmer has difficulty providing the necessary accounts documentation to support the application.</P>
        <P>The following table shows the average processing times at each local office for Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Benefit and Farm Assist in May 2009.</P>
        <P>The Carers allowance is administered centrally in the Department&rsquo;s office in Longford.  Consequently, statistics are not compiled on processing times on a county by county basis.  However, the average processing time for all carers claims processed in May 2009 was 8.93 weeks.</P>

	<P>One of the goals of the social welfare system is to be responsive to the needs of employees in low-paid, casual or vulnerable employment.  For example, persons who are employed for up to three days in a week may claim a jobseekers payment in respect of the remainder of the week, subject to being available for full-time work.</P>
        <P>In addition, Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides cash support for employees, with families, on low earnings or those seeking to make the transition from welfare to work.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  Take-up of the scheme has increased significantly in recent years with almost 43,000 new and renewal FIS claims in 2008, compared to just under 38,000 in 2007.</P>
        <P>A number of progressive measures have also been introduced in recent years aimed at removing disincentives for people wishing to take employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work.  These measures include the introduction of a tapered withdrawal of means-tested payments for unemployed people and people with disabilities who engage in employment and a tapered withdrawal of certain earnings for people in receipt of the rent and mortgage interest supplements.</P>

	<P>Since its introduction, the underlying objective of the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme has been to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market.  It is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education and who would not otherwise be able to do so.</P>
        <P>Changes to provide for earlier access to the scheme were announced in the recent supplementary budget.  In order to qualify for participation, an applicant must now be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for three months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to nine months for those who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with the Department&rsquo;s facilitator programme.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>In general, an applicant must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and recipients of jobseekers&rsquo; payments who are out of formal education for at least two years can qualify at 18 years of age.</P>
        <P>The requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.  A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.</P><Col N="172"/>
        <P>The back to education allowance has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.  The conditionality of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of  the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.</P>

	<P>The welfare system makes provision for the needs of people, including people employed as miners, under the Occupational Injuries Benefit scheme.  Miners who are unable to work due to an accident arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim.  This scheme, operated by the Department, provides entitlement to benefit for people suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment. </P>
        <P>Benefits are payable where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, and they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.  In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.  If the incapacity extends beyond the 26 week period, claimants may receive illness benefit or invalidity pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.</P>
        <P>Miners may also be entitled to disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme.  Disablement benefit is a compensation payment specifically for those who suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work.  Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with the norm for a person of the same age and gender.</P>

	<P>The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can be accommodated within the social welfare pensions system, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underlying entitlement to contributory payments and, in the case of non-contributory payments, the need to ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need.  Over the past ten years, means tests have been improved and qualifying conditions for contributory payments made easier. </P>
        <P>Many women in both the private and the public sectors left employment upon marriage because they were required to or because that was the societal norm at the time.  Public servants who left the workforce through the operation of the marriage bar were not insured for social welfare pension purposes.  Accordingly, the loss of pension rights in their case relates more to their occupational position rather than social welfare pension entitlements.</P>
        <P>That said, the Green Paper on Pensions considered a number of issues related to the qualifying conditions for a social welfare contributory pension including the pension position of women who had to resign due to the marriage bar.  The Government is actively considering these issues and will make final decisions in the context of the long-term framework on pensions which I expect will be published in the near future.</P>

	<P>In recent months, the Government has taken several initiatives to tackle the severe difficulties being faced by members of pension schemes, particularly defined benefit schemes.  These were immediate difficulties that required a quick response to help protect members&rsquo; benefits.  The Government introduced legislation to create a pensions insolvency payment scheme whereby members of schemes in wind-up whose employer is insolvent may receive a higher proportion of their benefits.  Defined benefit scheme wind-up priorities were reordered so that, in any defined benefit wind-up situation, employees and former employees who have not yet retired may receive a large proportion of their benefits.  The Government also introduced provisions to allow for more flexible restructuring of pension benefits and stronger regulation regarding remittance of contributions.  During this time, the Government has also been engaged in discussions with the social partners, including a strong emphasis on the pensions issue. </P>
        <P>I am aware that the pensions issue goes beyond these real and immediate difficulties and that a comprehensive framework is required to deal with all of the challenges facing our pension system over the medium to long term.  It is the intention of Government to do so.  The Green Paper on Pensions was published in October 2007, the consultation process concluded last year, and the Government has been working to produce a national pensions framework since then.</P>
        <P>Where quick responses to difficult pension issues have been required, the Government has done so and legislation has been passed.  Producing a national pensions framework, however, requires a considered response that puts comprehensive policies in place that will last for generations.  We have a window of opportunity relative to many other countries to address the complex challenges facing our pension system.  Our ultimate objective is a pension system which will deliver an adequate retirement income for all which is, at the same time, affordable and sustainable for the State and those who sponsor and provide pension schemes.</P><Col N="174"/>
        <P>In recent weeks, we have seen reports that pension funds are beginning to show positive returns again.  While this is to be welcomed, the Government will continue to discuss further long-term reform options for inclusion in the national pensions framework which will be published in the near future.</P>

	<P>At the end of May there were 9,072 jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims coded as having been self-employed prior to making their claim. Of this number 3,393 are in payment, 554 have been disallowed and 5,125 are currently being processed.   A self-employed person who was on another social welfare payment immediately prior to making their claim would not be included in these figures.</P>
        <P>Self-employed people or those who were formerly self-employed are treated the same as any other applicant for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. Those who do not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit which is based on PRSI contributions may qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance provided they satisfy the normal conditions which include a means test.</P>
        <P>Generally, self-employed people are assessed on the basis of their income in the past 12 months to determine their expected income in the following year.  If a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a substitute contract in the coming year, this is factored into the assessment of future income. It is also recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.  Social Welfare Inspectors take account of the economic environment in which the self-employed person is operating when projecting future earnings.</P>

	<P>In order to respond effectively to the growing numbers on the Live Register and the current employment situation, it was decided in the context of the recent supplementary budget to refocus resources on the enterprise strand of the back to work allowance which supports people into self employment. <Col N="176"/> These changes significantly strengthen the supports for job-seekers wishing to move to self employment.</P>
        <P>Claimants who qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are being afforded immediate access to a new short term enterprise allowance, provided they have 104 contributions paid or have established entitlement to statutory redundancy from their latest period of employment.  It is payable at the same rate and for the same duration as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>For job-seekers on the live register, the qualifying period required for access to the back to work enterprise allowance scheme has been reduced from 2 years to 12 months provided an entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is established.  Those who do not have an underlying entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance can access the scheme, as before, subject to the 2 year qualifying period.</P>
        <P>These changes to improve access to the scheme were made in conjunction with a reduction in the period for which the allowance is payable from 4 years to 2 years at 100% of existing social welfare entitlement in the first year and 75% in the second year.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P><Col N="177"/>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, the rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001 having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children.  Overall expenditure on child benefit grew from just under &euro;965 million in 2001 to nearly &euro;2.5 billion in 2008 as a result of these increases and growth in the number of eligible children.</P>
        <P>The Government was able to direct such substantial increases in financial support to all Irish families in recent years. However, given the scale of the current economic crisis, it is necessary to address all aspects of the public finances so as to avoid excessive borrowing and to ensure that fairness exists in the allocation of resources.  It was in that context that the Minister for Finance announced in the Supplementary Budget the Government&rsquo;s intention to either subject child benefit to income tax or means-test it from 2010.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the costs of a possible means-testing of Child Benefit, this would depend on a range of factors including the range and complexity of income sources to be tested.  The issues arising from which approach to adopt are considerable. In view of the complexities associated with the two options, the Commission on Taxation is currently examining the issues arising from this proposal. Their deliberations will inform the Government&rsquo;s final decision on how to proceed.</P>
        <P>Child Benefit is a key instrument in child income support policy with the main objectives of supporting families in the costs of rearing children and the alleviation of poverty.  I assure the House that a decision on how best to proceed will not be taken lightly by the Government.</P>

	<P>The Estimates for the Department of Social and Family Affairs which were published on 23 April last were based, in the main, on an analysis of trends as regards likely numbers of recipients and average value of payments in 2009.  The estimates for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance were significantly increased from the Estimates published at the time of the October Budget.  These estimates were increased in line with the Department of Finance&rsquo;s projections of an average Live Register of 440,000 for the year.</P>
        <P>Developments on the Live Register are being closely monitored by both my Department and the Department of Finance. The expenditure for all scheme is also being closely monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department.</P>

	<P>The respite care grant is an annual payment of &euro;1,700 for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. The payment is made regardless of the carer&rsquo;s means but is subject to certain conditions. One respite care grant per year is paid in respect of each person for whom the carer is providing full time, care and attention.</P>
        <P>The grant is paid automatically to the majority of carers who are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit. W here there is a domiciliary care allowance in payment but no carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit, the respite care grant was paid by the HSE. However, responsibility for the domiciliary care allowance transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in early 2009. Administration of the grant to these recipients will be shared by the HSE and the Department of Social and Family Affairs this year with all applications processed by the Department from 2010.</P>
        <P>A carer who does not receive carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit or a domiciliary care allowance but is providing full-time care and attention to a person must submit an application for payment each year. In order to qualify they must, in addition to other criteria, care for the person for at least six months and this period of care must include the first Thursday in June. This is in order to ensure that the grant is targeted at those providing full-time care over a significant period of time.</P>
        <P>This year the grant will benefit almost 70,000 carers. More than 63,200 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and domiciliary care allowance will receive the grant along with approximately 6,500 additional full-time carers who are not in receipt of one of these payments. The estimated cost of the scheme to the Department in 2009 is over &euro;112 million. The HSE will also have costs in respect of those grants paid to people in receipt of domiciliary care allowance alone.</P>
        <P>While the Department will continue to review its schemes with a view to improving supports for carers a s resources permit, there are no plans to amend the criteria for the respite care grant at this time.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 32 of 30 April 2009, her views on improving entitlements to job-<Col N="179"/>seeker supports for people who were formerly self-employed; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Self-employed persons pay a modified rate of PRSI contribution (Class S). These contributions provide cover for long-term pensions such as state pension and widow&rsquo;s/widower&rsquo;s contributory pension. However they do not provide cover for short-term benefits such as jobseeker&rsquo;s and illness benefits &mdash; these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.  The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed workers are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3%. They are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.</P>
        <P>In certain cases, a self-employed person who had insurable employment in the relevant year (currently 2007) and has sufficient PRSI contribution paid at the appropriate class s/he may qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment provided all the conditions of the scheme are satisfied.</P>
        <P>A self-employed person who has insufficient PRSI contributions paid may qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance which is a means tested payment. Generally, in assessing the means of a self-employed person, a Social Welfare Inspector will take into account the level of earnings in the preceding 12 months to determine their expected income in the following year. However, with the general downturn in the economy at present, it is accepted that earnings in the previous 12 months may not be representative of expected earnings in the coming year. The Social Welfare Inspector will take account of this fact in projecting future earnings.  There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</P>

	<P>Income chargeable to PRSI is, in general, defined in terms of income liable under Schedule E of the Income Tax Acts. Such income is generally derived from employment or self-employment.</P>
        <P>This income base is appropriate to the social insurance system as it is consistent with the contributory principle of the of the social insurance fund, whereby a relationship is established between the employment or self-employment status and the rate of contribution payable and benefits or pensions receivable as a result of these contributions.</P><Col N="180"/>
        <P>In common with many social insurance systems throughout the world, the system is not actuarially based but funded through a pay-as-you-go approach. Today&rsquo;s contributors support both past and current contributors while also ensuring their own future security by building up entitlement to later benefits and pensions and paying into a mechanism that redistributes income over one&rsquo;s own lifetime.</P>
        <P>The range of income which is subject to PRSI is reviewed on a regular basis. Most recently in 2004 the exemption of non-pecuniary emoluments from the charge to PRSI was removed. As a consequence, subject to certain exemptions, benefits in kind are now subject to PRSI.</P>
        <P>Any further revision of the PRSI base would be a matter for consideration by Government in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>Farm Assist is currently paid to some 7,900 customers and 941 new applications were received since 1 January 2009. The average weekly payment is &euro;217.36.</P>
        <P>There is no limit in relation to the size of herd or acreage a farmer may hold when applying for this scheme. In carrying out the means test for farm assist the Social Welfare Inspector seeks to establish the likely income of the farmer in the coming 12 months. In doing this, the income in the previous 12 months is examined and allowance is made for factors which would affect anticipated income in the future, for example a drop in the price of milk, increased fodder or other farming costs. As the Inspector is locally based she/he will be very familiar with farming issues in the locality.</P>
        <P>A farmer who is dissatisfied with a decision on a farm assist claim may lodge an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. In addition, a farmer who feels that his/her circumstances have changed since the last means assessment may request a review at any time.</P>
        <P>The farm assist scheme is a practical response by the Department to the situation of low-income farmers and it represents a long-term safety net for them. It benefits farm families with children and also provides increased payments to farming couples without children and to single farmers on low income.</P>

	<P>The 2006 Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy sets out the economic rationale for North/South collaboration as well as making concrete proposals for economic initiatives. The case for an all island approach is made where market failure arises from the existence of <Col N="181"/>the border or where public goods and services could be more efficiently produced on a co-ordinated basis.</P>
        <P>In the matter of enterprise, the Study identified a number of areas where co-ordinated policy intervention could prove beneficial including co-operation on trade and investment promotion, enhanced co-operation in support of enterprise and business development and improved regulatory environment.</P>
        <P>The clients of Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland are faced with similar challenges wherever their location on the island and, in many instances, both agencies offer largely parallel solutions to their clients where such an approach is appropriate. The Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are working together to ensure that the potential for development is exploited and that the challenges are met. In keeping with this goal, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s approach is to work in partnership with Invest NI and InterTradeIreland in an effort to maximise the benefits to all their clients.</P>
        <P>For example, Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI ran a Cross Border Enterprise Incubation Programme known as the Transform Programme with 43 participants from both jurisdictions.  It concluded in August 2008 and more than 60% of these businesses are trading successfully today.</P>
        <P>In April 2009 the two agencies launched a new initiative, Propel Ideas into Business Programme, which was strongly supported by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB). This Programme targets entrepreneurs who have ambitious business ideas with the objective of putting them through an intensive business development programme to make their projects &lsquo;investor ready&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>As far as Enterprise Ireland is concerned, financial support is tailored to the requirements of individual companies on the basis of clearly demonstrated need.  The agency has been very successful in providing financial support towards the cost of establishing, growing and expanding businesses.  The EI funding is typically a mix of equity and grants and is specifically intended to meet expenses in the areas of research and design, training, job creation and acquisition of capital assets.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s grant aid offer must comply with the stipulations of the European Commission with regard to State Aid. Grants for industry are one instrument which can be used in order to develop enterprise and Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s broad view is that the differential aid rates allowed in the BMW Region have been of benefit not solely with regard to the rate of start-ups but in terms of the development of existing companies.</P>
        <P>Non-financial supports are available for all EI supported projects. These include access to the Enterprise Ireland overseas office network for marketing/market research, technical/ technology and training advice, knowledge events and seminars.</P>
        <P>It is in the interest of all parties to continue to work together for the benefit of the all island economy and I am confident that every effort will continue to be made in this regard.</P>

	<P>Under the Redundancy Payment Scheme, Employers who give proper notice of redundancy (at least two weeks) to employees, and pay the statutory redundancy entitlement to those employees, are entitled to receive a 60% rebate from the Social Insurance Fund into which employers make regular payments through P.R.S.I. contributions.  The attached table sets out the monetary value of Rebate and Lump Sum payments paid out by the Department from 2005 and to date in 2009 as well as the number of employees covered by these payments.</P>
        <P>Lump sum payments are paid to employees in instances where the employer is either unable to pay or refuses to pay employees their statutory redundancy entitlement.  In cases where redundancy payments must be paid from the Fund because of employers&rsquo; refusal to pay, the statutory lump sum entitlement is paid in full to the employees from the Social Insurance Fund administered by the Department.  In such cases, the Department seeks to recover 100% of the monies from the employer.  In circumstances of informal insolvency, liquidations, receiverships, examinerships or bankruptcy, the Department is obliged to pay the statutory lump sum entitlement to eligible employees and later seek to recover 40% of the amount paid from the employer.</P>
        <P>It is not the practice of my Department to release information on redundancy matters in respect of individuals or companies.</P>

   <P>As regards the issue of cost to the Exchequer, the attached table sets out the direct costs from the Social Insurance Fund.  With regard to tax foregone, it should be noted that the statutory element of redundancy payments to workers are tax free.  Tax would be payable normally on a portion of &ldquo;ex gratia&rdquo; payments made by the employer to employees over and above the statutory element.  It is not possible to quantify the amount of tax lost as a result given that each job that has become redundant attracts different rates of pay and personal tax allowances.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The 2001 income tax year was a short transitional tax &ldquo;year&rdquo; running from 6 April to 31 December 2001 which preceded the first full calendar tax year 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002. It should be noted that as self-employed taxpayers were assessed for tax for the short &ldquo;year&rdquo; on 74% of the profits earned in a 12 month accounting period, the tax figure shown for 2001 in the table will not be directly comparable with those of earlier or later years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A core Government objective is to free up lending on a commercial basis into the economy to support economic growth and a number of actions have been taken to achieve this objective.  In the context of the bank guarantee scheme and recapitalisation the banks have made important commitments to support business lending. </P>
        <P>A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February and took effect on 13 March. This code applies to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner. The business <Col N="185"/>lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints. Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will give the customer reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice. This is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance.</P>
        <P>In addition, as part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met. Compliance with this commitment is being monitored by the Financial Regulator. Officials from my Department are also in regular contact with the banks concerned in relation to their progress on implementing these measures.</P>
        <P>My colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has recently set up a clearing group including representatives from the main banks, business interests and state agencies, which is chaired by officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The purpose of the group is to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions. Any questions on the clearing group should be directed to my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also underway and will be completed shortly. Amongst the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis. I am satisfied that this review, along with the quarterly reports from the recapitalised institutions, will give a clear picture regarding the flow of credit in the Irish economy which will inform future policy.</P>
        <P>The banks report that they are &ldquo;open for business&rdquo; as evidenced by their promotional and advertising material. The banks state that they have funds available for lending to businesses and have provided details on approval levels and amounts drawn down. They report a slowdown in certain areas which they say reflects a reduced level of demand. The review of credit availability will consider this aspect. The most recent Central Bank Monthly Statistics for April 2009 show a reduction in total credit outstanding from non-financial corporate bodies of nearly &euro;900 million compared with March 2009. This follows a &euro;1.3 billion reduction for March compared with February 2009.</P>
        <P>The banks have also agreed to each provide &euro;15m to a new seed capital fund with Enterprise Ireland. The banks funding will be matched as appropriate by funding under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Seed and Venture Capital Programme and/or by funding from other national or international investors. It is expected that much of these funds will be utilised by SMEs.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware from my previous reports to the House that PWC has carried out reviews of the loan books and the capital position of six of the covered institutions. Since then, additional due diligence reviews of Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland have been carried out, building on the assessments carried out by PWC. </P>
        <P>As I have previously stated, I am not in a position to release information contained in these reviews, other than what has been released to date, because of the commercially sensitive nature of the information.</P>
        <P>It was arising from our assessment of the initial reviews of the bad debts of the Irish financial institutions that the Government decided to establish the National Assets Management Agency to ensure that the loan books of the financial institutions were freed up to allow them to lend to the real economy. As I announced in early April, the potential book value of loans that will be transferred to NAMA is in the region of &euro;80 to &euro;90 billion. However, the amount paid by NAMA will be considerably less than this since loans will only be transferred at an appropriate written down value.</P>

	<P>The Health (Amendment) Act 2005 and the subsequent Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 and the (Health Charges for In-patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 provide the legislative basis for the imposition of long stay charges.  The legislation provides for two different classes of person for the purpose of levying a charge.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Class 1 </i></P>
<P el="0">Class 1 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.</P>
<P el="10"><i>Class 2</i></P>
<P el="0">Class 2 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.  </P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 2008 amend the 2005 regulations and provide for the first increase in the level of long stay charges payable since 2005.  The following revised level of charges will apply.</P>
        <P>In the case of Class 1 a weekly charge of &euro;153.25 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;44.70, whichever is the lesser. In the case of Class 2 a weekly charge of &euro;114.95 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;70.25 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>The actual charge levied will vary from person to person depending on individual circumstances and under the legislation the Health Service Executive can waive or reduce the charges to avoid undue financial hardship.</P>
        <P>The increase in the level of long stay charge levied is directly linked to recent increases in social welfare entitlements.  The new weekly charge for Class 1 of &euro;153.25 represents an increase of &euro;33.25 or 27.7% on the 2005 charges and the new weekly charge for Class 2 of &euro;114.95 represents an increase of &euro;24.95 or 27.7% on the 2005 charges.  In the corresponding period from 2005 to 2009 the rate of Disability Allowance payable has increased by &euro;55.50 or 37.3%.

	<P>The accepted approach to the control of mumps outbreaks is to ensure a high level of uptake of 2 doses of MMR vaccine in the population where cases are occurring. </P>
        <P>Outbreaks of mumps have become increasingly frequent in those aged 15 to 24 over recent years and from January to March 2009 there was a huge increase in the number of reported cases compared with the same period in 2008. The outbreak was happening because there was a large number of older teenagers who had not had 2 doses of MMR vaccine and therefore were at risk of getting mumps. In response to this increase, the Health Service Executive, in consultation with my Department decided to offer MMR vaccination to Transition, 5th and 6th Year students in secondary schools nationwide from April 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>A comprehensive policy, legislative and regulatory framework has been developed over the past couple of decades in respect of children in care.  Key policy documents and standards for children in need of care and protection include the Report of the Working Group on Foster Care, the Youth Homelessness Strategy, the Children First Guidelines, National Standards for <Col N="191"/>Foster Care, National Standards for Residential Care and the Agenda for Children&rsquo;s Services. Relevant legislation includes the Child Care Act, 1991, the Child Care Regulations, 1995, the Children Act, 2001, and the Health Act, 2007.  </P>
        <P>The Child Care Act, 1991 specifically requires the HSE, in carrying out its functions, to regard the welfare of children as the first and paramount consideration and in so far as practicable have regard to the wishes of the child.</P>
        <P>Section 26 of the Act provides that the court may appoint a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) in any proceedings, where the child might become the subject of a care or supervision order or is being placed in the care of the HSE. The GAL is an independent representative appointed by the court to ensure that the views of the child are heard by the court and to advise the court on the best interests of the child.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of advocacy the Office of the Ombudsman for Children was established in 2004 following the enactment of the Ombudsman for Children Act, 2002.  The Office provides an independent mechanism to vindicate the rights of children as required under the United Nation&rsquo;s Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The establishment of the Office was in recognition of the need for an independent person to act as an advocate for children and promote the welfare and rights of the child.</P>
        <P>A number of non-governmental organisations are also actively involved on a national basis in advocating on behalf of and providing information and advice to children.  A number of these organisations are in receipt of State funding.</P>
        <P>During 2007, my Office established the Inclusion Programme to develop best practice in participation, by providing new opportunities for seldom-heard young people to become involved in decision-making structures.  Funded organisations under this programme include advocacy groups such as Barnardos and Irish Association of Young People in Care. The programme is independently evaluated. It is intended to capture the learning from this programme to ensure that an increasing number of seldom-heard young people can take part in decision-making structures and processes.</P>

        <P>I have received a copy of the reports referred to by the Deputy.  The reviews were undertaken by the HSE following the deaths of two individuals who were in receipt of HSE services. The publication of both reports is a matter for the HSE.   I understand in this context that the HSE has indicated that it is not intended to publish the two reports.  In considering the issue of publication the HSE must be cognisant of the right to privacy and confidentiality of the deceased and any remaining family members. I have asked the HSE to advise me on the potential for publication by the HSE of the key findings of the reports where they relate to service provision generally and with a view to informing the development of child welfare and protection policy and services.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should note that additional funding of &euro;10 million was provided in Budget 2009 for the HSE for disability and mental health to enable these services to be enhanced and strengthened. </P>
        <P>This funding will allow for the provision of a total of 125 additional therapy posts in the HSE targeted at children of school-going age. 90 of these will be in disability services, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.</P>
        <P>This additional funding will also allow for the recruitment of 35 therapy posts for the child and adolescent mental health service. This will enable the HSE to increase the number of Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams to 69 by the end of 2009. Once-off funding of &euro;1m was provided for suicide prevention initiatives including the development of an awareness campaign aimed at young people. Furthermore, additional once-off funding of &euro;750,000 was allocated for mental health projects supporting service users and carers.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that overall funding of approximately &euro;1.56 billion is provided in the Estimates 2009 for disability services and &euro;1 billion is provided for mental health services.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the procedures to control public finances and the Health Act 2004 which established the HSE, the HSE must receive the sanction of the Minister for Finance before it may enter into new commitments in respect of the development of services.  This is provided each year after the publication of the Revised Book of Estimates and is given in accordance with strict provisions regarding the use of funds, in particular funds allocated to further enhance and develop services.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware the finalisation of the revised estimates and their publication was delayed due to the necessity for the Government to deal with the critical situation facing the <Col N="193"/>public finances.  The letter of sanction, which includes sanction of development funding issued to the HSE on 15 June. In view of the urgency of the matter the Minister for Finance sanctioned the funding for the suicide prevention programme on the 18 May.</P>
        <P>The additional development funding provided in Budget 2009 has been allocated to a new subhead for service developments.  These funds together with the other expenditure of the HSE are the subject of regular and detailed analysis by my Department.</P>

	<P>My Department is currently preparing the General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill to regulate the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of human tissue from deceased persons, and the use of donated tissue from living persons for the purposes of transplantation and research.  A public consultation on the draft Proposal for the General Scheme of the Bill took place between 9 April and 29 May.  Submissions received are currently being analysed.  The types of activities covered by the proposals include hospital post-mortem examinations and the use of organs and tissues for transplantation, research, anatomy and education.</P>
        <P>One aim of the draft legislation is to establish a legal framework for organ donation which can benefit patients through transplantation of organs.  Consent/authorisation is the defining principle underpinning any of the specified activities involving human tissue set out in the draft legislation.  A separate, but related, public consultation on the different types of consent for the donation of organs for transplantation after death took place earlier this year and more than one thousand submissions were received.  Ireland already has one of the higher rates of organ donation, ranked seventh in Europe in 2007.  All organ donation in Ireland is coordinated through the Organ Procurement Service, which is based in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
        <P>My Department is analysing all submissions received from the consultation process and aims to present the final General Scheme to Government for its approval in the Autumn.</P>

	<P>Under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, it is an offence to assault any person, adult or child. Also, it is an offence under the Children Act 2001 for a person who has custody of a child to assault, ill-treat, neglect or abandon or expose a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child&rsquo;s health or seriously affect the child&rsquo;s well-being.  The common law recognises the right of a parent to administer moderate or reasonable physical chastisement on a child.  This right takes the form of the defence of reasonable chastisement in the event of prosecution.  In order to rely successfully on this defence, the motive for, duration and force of physical punishment must be objectively reasonable.

By its nature, it does not apply to the Garda Reserve, whose members are unpaid volunteers who do not occupy public service posts.  The total intake of students in the first months of 2009 was 200 with the second intake of students occurring in early May. After that the moratorium on recruitment applies.  The moratorium is due to remain in place until the end of 2010, and can only be deviated from in exceptional circumstances with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>Since 2008 there have been eighteen legal challenges in the High Court to the decisions which the Minister has made to refuse applications for certificates of naturalisation. Seventeen of these challenges were unsuccessful. One case was successful in that the court ordered that the Minister reconsider his decision on the basis that certain information provided in the submission prepared for the Minister should not have been presented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 and 1986, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation. There is no appeal process provided for in legislation, however the applicant can at any time make a new application.</P>
        <P>The decision on whether or not to grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation lies solely with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The courts may not instruct or compel the Minister to reach any specified decision on an application for naturalisation because of the constitutional separation of powers.</P>

	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy applied for Asylum on 11/01/2005.<b></b> The claim was assessed by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation was communicated to him by letter dated 29/06/2005.  This communication advised the person of his entitlement to appeal the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did.</P>
        <P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the person&rsquo;s appeal, following which the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner&rsquo;s earlier recommendation to reject his claim.  The outcome of the appeal was made known to the applicant by letter dated<b> </b>12/06/2009.</P>
        <P>In accordance with normal procedures, the applicant&rsquo;s file has been forwarded to my Department&rsquo;s Ministerial Decisions Unit for final processing of the Asylum claim.  A letter will issue to him from my Department<b> </b>advising him formally that his asylum claim has been rejected and affording him three options as follows: 1. Return home voluntarily; 2.

        <P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation was received, from the second person mentioned, in the Citizenship Division of my Department on 27 February 2007.  Officials in that section inform me that processing of the application is at an advanced stage and it is likely that the file will be forwarded to the me for a decision in the coming months.  However, the Deputy should note that the address quoted in the question does not match the address recorded on file.  If the applicant has changed address, she should notify the Citizenship Division as soon as possible.</P>

        <Quest> if he will make a statement on Israel&rsquo;s continuing blockade of Gaza, in particular, on its arbitrary prohibition of items such as tinned meat, tomato paste, clothing, shoes and notebooks (details supplied). </Quest>
        <QRef>[25554/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated in this House and elsewhere, I consider the continued effective blockade of Gaza by Israel to be both morally unacceptable and politically mistaken. I have consistently emphasised, in discussions with my <Col N="211"/>EU colleagues and directly to Israeli Ministers, my view that the blockade should be brought to an end immediately, and the crossing points opened without restrictions on the normal movement of persons and goods.</P>
        <P>The main reasons advanced by the Israeli authorities for these restrictions were attacks on Israel from Gaza and the continued holding of the kidnapped Corporal Shalit. I have repeatedly condemned both these actions on behalf of the Government. However, neither are the responsibility of the people of Gaza as a whole and it is unacceptable to punish them collectively in the general hope that this will generate pressure on the Hamas authorities in Gaza.</P>
        <P>After two years of this blockade, this policy has completely failed in its goal of undermining the control of Gaza by Hamas. If anything, it has only served to increase support for Hamas and other radical and militant groups, both by directly radicalising young Palestinians and by destroying the economic enterprises which could offer them an alternative path in life. It is also steadily eroding the sympathy which has existed internationally for Israel&rsquo;s real concerns about security.</P>
        <P>As I have stated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the decisions as to which items are or are not allowed into Gaza have defied all comprehension. The blocking of food deliveries has understandably created the greatest anger, in due course leading to an Israeli decision to allow all food imports. It is clear, however, that some foodstuffs continue to be blocked on the basis that they are luxuries, not necessities, and that the total level of food imports is restricted to just above what is needed for subsistence.</P>
        <P>Frankly, it is also difficult to discount altogether the possibility that the interests of Israeli food producers and storage companies are involved in the decisions governing the supply of foods and other goods to a population of 1.4 million people, as well as the restrictions on exports by producers in Gaza. Growers of fruit, vegetables and flowers in Gaza are of course unable to remain in business if they cannot export their produce when it is ready.</P>
        <P>The only acceptable course of action, and the one which is in Israel&rsquo;s own interests, is to end this blockade immediately.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the statement made by Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Benjamin Netanyahu on 14 June 2009; if he will ensure that Ireland will in no way support improved trade relations between Israel and the EU; and his further views on Israel&rsquo;s refusal to halt all expansion in the West Bank. </Quest>
        <QRef>[25617/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council on 15 June welcomed as an initial step the statement by Prime Minister Netanyahu which recognised the goal of a peace which would involve the establishment of a Palestinian state. It is important that Mr. Netanyahu, as Likud leader and Prime Minister, has finally stated this, and to a conservative audience in Israel. </P>
        <P>I was disappointed, however, with the heavily qualified nature of Prime Minister Netanyahu&rsquo;s willingness to contemplate a future Palestinian state, which essentially accorded priority to Israel&rsquo;s security concerns above all other considerations.</P>
        <P>The aim of the peace process, as the EU has consistently made clear, must be a comprehensive settlement based on two states coexisting in peace, providing for the security, dignity and aspirations of both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. The security of both Israelis and Palestinians is a legitimate concern which must be addressed in the negotiations. However, <Col N="212"/>Israeli demands on &lsquo;final status issues&rsquo; cannot be accepted as preconditions to the process. President Obama has made it clear that this is also his view.</P>
        <P>We will therefore be watching closely what the parties actually do, as well as what their statements contain.</P>
        <P>The continued expansion of Israeli settlements is a major problem which I have focussed on in discussions at EU level and with Israeli and other leaders in the region. This relentless process is creating obstacles to peace which may make it very difficult for any Israeli Government to reach a peace agreement with its neighbours and serves to weaken the standing of moderate Palestinian leaders. Moreover, the daily and cumulative injustices and humiliations which the whole settlement process involves for the Palestinian population continually increase the risk of another large scale descent into violence.</P>
        <P>It was therefore disappointing, if not unexpected, that Mr. Netanyahu&rsquo;s speech rejected the demand of both the EU and the United States for an immediate freeze on settlement construction. It is true that he pledged that no new settlements would be constructed, but in terms that were general enough to allow almost any interpretation. Again, this is a critical area where we will be watching what actually happens on the ground. Continued evictions of Palestinians and destruction of their homes will be a clear rejection of the demands of the international community.</P>
        <P>In relation to EU &mdash; Israel relations, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question 329 of 23 June, in which I dealt with this issue in more detail.  What had been envisaged was a deepening of political relations and cooperation on practical matters, rather than trade relations.  In the event, and in line with the argument I have been consistently making with our EU partners, the Council has decided not to proceed with the so-called &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; of political relations at this time, and practical cooperation will continue to be governed by the existing agreement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.</P>
        <P>I have made enquiries of an t&Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir regarding the matter raised by the Deputy and the position is as set out below.</P>
        <P>The provisions governing the registration of domestic adoptions and the issue of birth certificates drawn from the register of adoptions are set out in section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.  Under these provisions, the Registrar General is charged with maintaining an Adopted Chil<Col N="213"/>dren Register and also to keep an index to make traceable the connection between each entry and the corresponding entry in the register of births.  The index is not open to public inspection and no information from it may be given to any person except by order of a Court or of the Adoption Board. A certified copy of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, if purporting to be issued under the seal of Oifig an &Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raitheora, shall, without further proof, be received as evidence of the facts stated therein and any requirement of law for the production of a certificate of birth shall be satisfied by the production of such certified copy.</P>
        <P>Under the above provisions, birth certificates for adopted persons are available only from the Office of the Registrar General. While it is appreciated that this may cause a degree of inconvenience in certain instances the security and confidentiality of the Adopted Children Register is of paramount importance and it is for this reason only that the restriction on availability exists.  For this reason also, there are no plans to amend the legislation to change the current arrangements in relation to this matter.</P>
        <P>At the moment persons applying to GRO for certificates of life events may do so in writing or by fax.  Payments are accepted by Visa or Mastercard.  An on-line application facility for records of life events, including adoption events, is at an advanced stage of development and will be introduced shortly.  Payments by credit card, including laser card, will be a feature of the on-line service.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest.  The purpose of the supplement is to provide short term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. </P>
        <P>There are currently 12,900 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 213% over those in payment at end 2007.</P><Col N="214"/>
        <P>The mortgage interest supplement scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department and is delivered locally by community welfare officers.  The operational arrangements for the processing of applications and the payment to qualifying individuals, is a matter for the respective community welfare division areas.</P>
        <P>A community welfare officer interviews applicants for mortgage interest supplement when they first present in order to determine if they satisfy the statutory qualifying conditions for entitlement.  They also ensure that all the documentation required to make a decision has been provided.  Claim details are recorded on the computer system in cases where it is established that mortgage interest supplement is payable.  However, given the considerable pressures on the service claim details are not always recorded on the system where no entitlement has been established to mortgage interest supplement, where an appeal has been lodged with an appeals officer of the HSE, case claim details are recorded electronically.</P>
        <P>For this reason, reliable statistics are not available on the total number of people who applied for and were refused mortgage interest supplement.  The review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is progressing.  The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence.  Legislative and operational issues arising in the existing mortgage interest scheme, are also being examined.  The review will also examine operational aspects of the scheme including best practice in the recording, collating and maintenance of statistical data on the mortgage interest supplement scheme.</P>

	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local services throughout the country. In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8 pm, Monday to Friday, at lo-call number 1890 283 438 and budgeting and money management information can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie. </P>
        <P>In 2009, almost &euro;18 million has been provided to fund the MABS.  Additional investment in recent years has strengthened the capacity of the MABS to deal with increased demand for service.  There are 252 money advice staff employed throughout the country and the Telephone Helpline has been strengthened to provide an immediate response to clients seeking information and advice.</P>
        <P>All MABS companies operate an appointments system for meeting clients. Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and dealt with promptly.  Cases that are less urgent are referred to the Telephone Helpline and to the website for immediate assistance with budgeting and money management issues.  The Helpline can now handle less complex straight forward single debt cases such as threatened utility disconnections and deals directly with the <Col N="215"/>ESB and An Bord Gais in relation to these cases.  Over 90% of callers to the Helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline advisor.  The Telephone Helpline also assists local services to manage their appointment lists by providing an initial MABS service to clients and ongoing support while they await their appointment with their local money advisor.</P>
        <P>Local services monitor their waiting times for appointments and, where required, seek guidance and assistance in managing their caseload from MABS NDL, the national support company. Information is not collected centrally on waiting times for appointments at different MABS offices throughout the country.</P>
        <P>MABS NDL has introduced a number of community education and other management support initiatives to assist the local services with their increased caseloads.  These include an education programme for people facing redundancy to inform them about managing on a reduced income and how to avoid getting into debt.</P>

	<P>My Department has not received a request for a refund of PRSI contributions that have been overpaid by the client&rsquo;s recently deceased partner.  With regard to PRSI refunds generally, it should be noted that refunds in respect of a deceased client are made, through the legal representative dealing with the estate, to the estate of the deceased and not to the spouse/partner of the client. </P>
        <P>In terms of eligibility for a State Pension, the social welfare system provides for a number of benefits and assistance payments payable to widows and widowers on the death of a spouse.  These include Widow&rsquo;s and Widower&rsquo;s Pensions (contributory and non-contributory), Widowed Parent Grants and some payments under occupational injuries provisions.  Currently, two Widows Pensions can be payable based on one person&rsquo;s PRSI contributions i.e. where a person married, divorced and subsequently re-married.  On death, both the surviving spouse and the surviving former spouse can claim a Widow&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s pension.  In order to qualify for these payments, the survivor must have been married.</P>

	<P>There are currently almost 88,800 recipients of rent supplement, a 49% increase since the end of 2007.  The recent Supplementary Budget provided that the weekly minimum contribution payable towards rent be increased from &euro;18 to &euro;24 a week, with effect from 1 June 2009.  It also provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date.  New maximum rent limits have also been introduced from 1 June 2009 to reflect the general reductions in private sector rent levels.</P>
        <P>The most recent data published by the CSO, shows that rents in the private sector have fallen by almost 11% since November 2008 and by almost 20% in the past year.  A leading property website recently reported that rents have fallen by almost 16% in the twelve months to March 2009 with 5% of the fall occurring since the start of 2009.  It is essential therefore that state support for tenants who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices.</P>
        <P>Existing recipients of rent supplement were notified in advance of the change being made to their rent payment from 1 June 2009.  This communication can be shown to landlords as evidence of the revised rent supplement in payment in individual cases.  Landlords have also been advised through advertising in the national and provincial newspapers of the general reduction in rent supplement payments and a number of organisations representing landlords and tenants were contacted and advised of the changes to the rent supplement scheme.</P>
        <P>Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, once the tenancy is at least a year old and where the rent has not been reviewed in the previous twelve months, the tenant is entitled to ask a landlord to review the rent where the tenant feels that the rent exceeds the market rate for the property.  While tenants may be contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally. <Col N="217"/> In this climate, it is expected that people will be able to get accommodation at the appropriate rental level if a landlord is unwilling to reduce the rent in any particular case.</P>
        <P>The obligation of landlords and tenants in relation to tenancy terminations, including the refund of deposits, is also provided for in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  Under these provisions, tenants are entitled to a refund of a deposit paid at the commencement of the tenancy where there is no rent or utility bills owing, no damage to the dwelling beyond normal wear and tear and the proper notice prescribed in the Act is served.  Disputes between landlords and tenants about any aspect of rent or the return of a deposit may be referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.</P>
        <P>Community Welfare Officers have discretion to provide assistance where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case.  Officers have been advised that support, appropriate to the circumstances of the particular case, may be provided to rent supplement tenants for up to two months, while alternative accommodation is being sourced within the existing rent limits.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166, 169, 171 and 174 together.</P>
        <P>The Live Register has increased to unprecedented levels as a result of the economic downturn that the country is currently experiencing.  The Live Register now stands at 396,871 as opposed to 201,756 this time last year.  The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as expeditiously as possible.  The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands.  The average processing time for claims processed in May was 3.68 weeks for jobseekers benefit and 6.35 weeks for jobseekers allowance.  Processing times can vary from office to office for a number of reasons including the extent of the increased number of claims, the number of staff vacancies, the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office which impacts on the overall level of experience in the office.</P>
        <P>During 2008 the need for some 150 additional posts was identified in order to respond to the significant increase in the number of people applying for Jobseekers payments in particular.  Staff were sourced during 2008 and the early part of 2009 to meet this requirement.</P>
        <P>With the live register continuing to increase, the Department has requested more than 300 extra posts in 2009, in addition to those already mentioned.</P>
        <P>Of these:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />49 posts have being assigned to date for Local Office Central Support Units in 5 locations.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />And some 90 temporary staff have been appointed to Local Offices around the country pending the assignment of permanent staff.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition to increased staffing for local offices, the number of Social Welfare Inspectors was increased by 16 earlier this year to undertake means testing of claims for social assistance payments including jobseekers allowance, farm assist and carers allowance.  More recently it has been decided to assign a further 24 Inspectors and the necessary arrangements are in train to have these posts filled.</P>
        <P>Since early 2008 we have been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining them wherever possible without, of course, compromising our scheme controls.  Examples of process improvement initiatives introduced recently include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous 2 years</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps reduce queuing times.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />More straight-forward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseekers allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />We have introduced an appointment system for taking claims in 16 offices and plan to extend this to other offices over the coming months.</P><Col N="219"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Deputy will be aware that anyone suffering hardship can apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  SWA provides a safety net against poverty in that it gives a statutory entitlement to a minimum weekly income, based on criteria set out in legislation.  The majority of SWA claims are processed within a matter of days.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible persons living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
        <P>There are currently almost 88,800 recipients of rent supplement, a 49% increase since the end of 2007.  The published estimate of expenditure for 2009 for rent supplement is &euro;490.4 million, an increase of &euro;50.7 million on the outturn of expenditure in 2008.  Expenditure on rent supplement is closely monitored on a monthly basis taking into account trends in recipient numbers, average monthly payments and savings arising from the supplementary budget measures.</P>
        <P>The recent Supplementary Budget provided that the weekly minimum contribution payable towards rent be increased from &euro;18 to &euro;24 a week, with effect from 1 June 2009.  It also provided that payments currently being mad e to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date.  Other changes in the Supplementary Budget provided that new maximum rent limits apply to all new claimants, from 1 June 2009, to reflect the general reductions in private sector rent levels.</P>
        <P>The most recent data published by the CSO, shows that rents in the private sector have fallen by almost 11% since November 2008 and by almost 20% in the past year.  It is essential therefore that state support for tenants who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate it is difficult to examine estimated expenditure into the future.  It is expected, based on current expenditure trends that the overall 2009 allocation for the Department will be adequate.  Developments in relation to current year expenditure will continue to be closely monitored.</P>

	<P>The Estimates for the Department of Social and Family Affairs which were published on 23 April last were based, in the main, on an analysis of trends as regards likely numbers of recipients and average value of payments in 2009.  Final expenditure will depend on factors such as the actual recipient numbers in 2009 which can vary.  It is too early in the year to draw conclusions on what the actual expenditure will be in each area.  Expenditure is being monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 and 173 together.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP), operated jointly by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and F&Aacute;S, is the main welfare to work measure for jobseekers. Under the plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to F&Aacute;S for interview with a view to assisting them to enter or re-enter the labour market. The referral capacity under the plan has nearly doubled for 2009 from 6,500 cases per month to 12,250.</P>
        <P>The NEAP process is fundamental in addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register. It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by F&Aacute;S. In addition, the Government is now providing, through F&Aacute;S, a total of 128,000 training and activation places for unemployed people this year. There are also some 147,000 places available in further education programmes in 2009. This is a substantial increase on the number of places available previously.</P>
        <P>The recent supplementary budget outlined a joint approach to activation by the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Enterprise Trade and Employment and Education and Science. I introduced a package of measures relating to the Department&rsquo;s two main employment support schemes, the back to work enterprise allowance and back to education allowance, in order to facilitate better access to these supports. The changes provided for a reduction in the qualifying period required for access to the back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) from 2 years to 12 months provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. The qualifying period for the back to education scheme was also reduced.</P>
        <P>I also introduced a new short term enterprise allowance scheme. Under this scheme someone who qualifies for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is being afforded the opportunity to commence self-<Col N="222"/>employment immediately. I also introduced a new short term enterprise allowance scheme. Under this scheme someone who qualifies for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is being afforded the opportunity to commence self-employment immediately provided they have 104 contributions paid or have established entitlement to statutory redundancy. It is payable at the same rate and for the same duration as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department&rsquo;s locally based facilitators provide information on progression options available to people on social welfare. They work closely with F&Aacute;S and other agencies at national and local level to identify appropriate training and developmental programmes for social welfare recipients of working age to enhance the skills those individuals have and ultimately improve their employment chances as well as helping them to develop personally. This service was enhanced under the National Development Plan (NDP) Social and Economic Participation Programme. There are currently 60 facilitators in place, with a further 10 due for appointment, bringing the total to 70.</P>
        <P>Apart from specific employment support and welfare to work initiatives, the social welfare system is highly responsive to the needs of employees in low-paid, casual or vulnerable employment. For example, people who are employed for up to three days in a week may claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in respect of the remainder of the week, subject to being available for full-time work.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department&rsquo;s family income supplement scheme (FIS) provides cash support for employees on low earnings with families or those seeking to make the transition from welfare to work. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments. Take-up of the scheme has increased significantly in recent years with almost 43,000 new and renewal FIS claims in 2008, compared to almost 37,900 in 2007.</P>
        <P>With the increasing numbers of people who are unemployed, the Government is continuing to develop and put in place new programmes to enhance the work experience and training opportunities for these individuals. Two such initiatives, the work placement programme and a pilot short time working training programme were announced recently . Under both initiatives, participants will continue to receive their existing social welfare entitlements from the Department of Social and Family Affairs while they are taking part in these innovative programmes.</P>
        <P>The range and conditions for the Department&rsquo;s welfare to work initiatives will continue to be monitored in the light of changing economic circumstances.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. </P>
        <P>The Executive has advised that rent supplement was refused on the basis that the person concerned was not in a position to afford the rent at the time she took on the tenancy in question. She was in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance at that time. Article 9(2) (a)(1) of SI 412/07 provides that a Rent Supplement should only be paid where the claimant &ldquo;could reasonably have afforded the rent at the commencement of the tenancy&rdquo;.  She appealed against this decision to an Appeals Officer of the Executive and that appeal was successful. The person concerned was advised of the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision on 16 June 2009.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 to 185, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>The support given to the President in relation to the programme of State Travel (both visits abroad and incoming) and with the acceptance of the credentials of Ambassadors to Ireland is a matter for the Government.  The President acts in these matters on the advice of the Government and the arrangements are made by Government.  The arrangements are in accordance with the generally accepted practice internationally.</P>
        <P>Part of the role of the Defence Forces is the provision of ceremonial support generally. As the personnel are drawn from the cadre of the Defence Forces, no additional costs arise which would not otherwise be incurred in the normal course with the exception of the transportation of troops to the ceremonial location.  The costs of such transportation are not compiled separately by my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am satisfied that the appearance of Defence Forces personnel in these roles, in support of the President and at the annual commemorative and parade events, is a small but very important part of their duties.</P>
        <P>The main Ceremonial support provided includes a Guard of Honour, a Band, an Escort and Marshals for events such as:</P><Col N="225"/>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Following the report in June 2005 of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts, the Government, approved the establishment of an inter-departmental advisory committee and an expert group, working to the committee, on the health effects of electromagnetic fields.   The committee reported to the Government in March 2007 and the Government published the report of the Expert Group on Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields on 22 March 2007 (available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.environ.ie/en/publications).</P>
        <P>The Report examined a wide range of issues in relation to potential health effects of Electromagnetic Fields (EMF), including those produced by mobile telecommunications, and answers many questions commonly raised in relation to the health effects of electromagnetic fields.  It concluded that, so far, no adverse short or long-term health effects have been found from exposure to the radio frequency signals produced by mobile phones and base station transmitters. My Department&rsquo;s advice to those living in close proximity to mobile phone base stations, based on the conclusions of the Expert Group Report, is that there is no scientific basis for, or evidence of, adverse health effects in children or adults as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields. This applies irrespective of the location of the phone mast.</P>
        <P>In general, planning permission must be obtained for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast.  Under Article 6 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regu<Col N="226"/>lations 2001, certain classes of development carried out by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service are, subject to specified conditions, exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts.  These include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the erection of an antenna support structure in place of an existing antenna support structure, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as lamp posts, flag poles, CCTV poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings (other than educational facilities, childcare facilities or hospitals).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The above exemptions are conditional on, among other things, the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emissions from the site not exceeding the limits specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation.</P>
        <P>A decision on a planning application is, of course, a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal.</P>
        <P>My Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunications and Support Structures in 1996.  The guidelines are intended to facilitate planning authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the licensed providers of mobile telecommunications services and the public by providing guidance on dealing with these developments within the planning system.</P>
        <P>The guidelines set out a locational hierarchy in relation to the siting of radio masts and advise that free-standing masts should only be located within or in the immediate surrounds of smaller towns or villages as a last resort.  If such a location should become necessary, the masts and antennae should be designed and adapted for the specific location.  In the vicinity of larger towns and in city suburbs, operators should endeavour to locate in industrial estates or in industrially zoned land.  The guidelines further advise that, only as a last resort, and if all the alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should free-standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools.  Under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities are required to have regard to any Ministerial guidelines, in the performance of their functions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has a number of initiatives in place which will facilitate the use of currently vacant houses to meet the accommodation needs of both households on local authority housing waiting lists and rent supplement recipients with a long term housing need.</P>
        <P>In the first instance, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, is designed to cater for the long term housing needs of rent supplement households. The core objectives of the RAS are to reform the approach towards providing accommodation within the private rented sector for long-term dependents on rent supplement and to enhance the response of housing authorities to meeting long-term housing need.  One of the main features of the scheme is that housing authorities, in sourcing accommodation for these households, make use of the private and voluntary sector and enter into contractual arrangements to secure medium to long-term availability of rented accommodation.</P>
        <P>To supplement this scheme, I have introduced two additional initiatives in recent months, which will make further use of vacant stock and assist authorities in meeting housing needs.  Firstly, in February 2009, I introduced new arrangements for the delivery of social housing whereby housing authorities may enter into long term leases of private dwellings for periods of between 10 and 20 years, taking advantage of the extent of available property in the market and at the same time providing a more efficient and effective use of public resources in meeting housing needs.  Secondly, my Department has advised housing authorities that they can consider transferring unsold affordable housing stock to both the leasing scheme and the RAS, where appropriate.</P>

I approved grant assistance of &euro;1.547m for the scheme in June 2008 following examination of Clare County Council&rsquo;s Preliminary Report Review for the Carrigaholt element of the scheme and its Design Review Report for Labasheeda.

	<P>The Killeagh Water Supply Scheme is included for funding under the Serviced Land Initiative measure of my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.    My Department approved Cork County Council&rsquo;s design proposals for the scheme in 2006.</P>
        <P>In April 2009, my Department, following a review of the Serviced Land Initiative in light of developments in the economy at large, and in the housing market in particular during 2008, and having regard to the oversupply of housing in some areas, informed all local authorities that all existing approvals under the Initiative, for which contracts had not been signed or letters of intent had issued, were being withdrawn.  However, authorities were also informed that where a water services authority was of the opinion that the continuation of an approved scheme for which contracts had not been signed was necessary for the proper development of the area, it was open to the authority to make a case to the Department by 29 May 2009 for the scheme to progress.  Cork County Council has not made a case to advance the Killeagh Water Supply Scheme under the Serviced Land Initiative.  However, I understand that the Council is considering other options for the advancement of this scheme at a future date.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
        <P>Section 137 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 specifies the fee for the registration of a single tenancy with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) within one month of the commencement of the tenancy as &euro;70 and a fee of &euro;140 applies where the tenancy is registered after this period.  The Act also provides for a composite fee of &euro;300 for multiple tenancies in one building, where the tenancies are registered within one month of the commencement of each individual tenancy.  Section 138 of the Act specifies that the Board may vary these fees in line with changes in the value of money.  No such variation has been made to either fee and I have not had specific discussions with third parties in relation to the above fees.</P>
        <P>In terms of the financing of the PRTB, its operations are funded from a combination of annual Exchequer grant, a proportion of the fee income accruing from tenancy registrations and fees it charges for its dispute resolution services.  In addition, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has in the past made payments for the benefit of the PRTB, primarily for accommodation overheads, and some fixed assets have also been transferred to the PRTB by my Department.</P>
        <P>The annual amounts provided by way of Exchequer grant, OPW payments and asset transfers for the period from the establishment of the Board in September 2004 to the end of 2008 are set out hereunder in tabular form.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.</P>
        <P>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 was amended by the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2009, which was a technical piece of legislation introduced to regularise a number of appointments to the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) about which concerns had been raised in terms of procedural and technical correctness.  Earlier this year, I announced my intention to review the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 under which the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) operates.  The purpose of this review is to consider whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.</P>
        <P>Full details in relation to the background to the review and the associated terms of reference are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.environ.ie.  In summary, the specific issues to be considered in the course of the review are:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The scope for enhancing procedural simplicity and efficiency.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The existing Board and Committee structure and the functional relationship between the Board and Executive.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The relationship between the Minister/Department and the PRTB.</P><Col N="232"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Legislative issues, including proposals already made by the Board, and the need for additional legislative provisions arising from the review.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The review, which I hope will yield preliminary outcomes by Autumn 2009, has now commenced and is being carried out by my Department itself.  As part of the review, my Department is consulting with relevant stakeholders, including the PRTB and landlord and tenant representative organisations.  Advertisements were also placed in the print media at the end of May 2009 seeking the views of the public.  The Board, in fulfilment of its remit to advise on policy aspects and the general operation of the Residential Tenancies Act, has already submitted to my Department a number of suggestions for legislative improvements and it is hoped to address the most critical of these in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, currently before the Oireachtas, with the remaining proposals being considered further in the context of the review.</P>
        <P>As my Department has no function in the operational matters of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), which is an independent statutory body established under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific cases or classes of cases.  However, I understand that the PRTB is examining the various issues around the retention of deposits, including an assessment of deposit models, and that the Board hopes to conclude its research in this regard in the next few months.  I expect the outcome of this research to feed into the Residential Tenancies Acts review outlined above.</P>

The PRTB may be contacted at their offices at O&rsquo;Connell Bridge House, D&rsquo;Olier Street, Dublin 2 or by telephone or email. Contact details are available on the Board&rsquo;s website at www.prtb.ie.  As a State Agency, the PRTB is subject to Government policy in relation to public sector numbers.  While the impact of such policies on the PRTB will be kept under review, it should be noted that a request from the Board of the PRTB for the recruitment of an additional 14 permanent staff, to bring the permanent staffing complement from 26 to 40, was approved last year.  This has been of significant benefit to the Board in dealing with the administrative work associated with the processing of registrations and dispute cases.  The purposes for which tenancy registration fees are utilised are set out in the reply to a question on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.</P>

	<P>The PRTB, an independent statutory body, is committed to delivering its services in as timely a manner as possible and it has set out a clear strategic approach in this regard.  My Department supports the PRTB in this approach and, last year, in response to the large and ongoing volume of work involved, a request from the Board of the PRTB for the recruitment of an additional 14 permanent staff, to bring the permanent staffing complement from 26 to 40, was approved.  This has been of significant benefit to the Board in dealing with the administrative work associated with the processing of registrations and dispute cases.</P>
        <P>In December last year I launched the PRTB&rsquo;s 2009-2011 Corporate Plan which set&rsquo;s out the organisation&rsquo;s priorities in the adjudication and administration of landlord/tenant disputes.  The Plan commits the PRTB to the development of an on-line tenancy registration system and to the implementation of a system of on-line registration of disputes.  I share the Board&rsquo;s considered view that online registration will yield significant operational and other efficiencies and will benefit all stakeholders.  To facilitate this I have introduced an amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 via the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, currently before the Oireachtas, to allow for online electronic registration of tenancies.</P>

	<P>I am advised that the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board is to undertake a feasibility study over the summer months to establish the best location on the Boyne for another fish counter.  It is not possible until the feasibility study report is complete to estimate when a counter will be installed.  Details of the cost of the counter already purchased by the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board have not changed since provided to the Deputy in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 396 of 31 March 2009.</P>

        <Quest> his views regarding complications of management procedures and the validity of existing licences for aquaculture projects in Lough Foyle due to the poorly defined nature of jurisdiction and competency of his Department, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland and the Crown Estate which lays claim to Lough Foyle; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As there has been no formal agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom on the delimitation of a territorial waters boundary between the two States, the policy of the two Governments has been to co-operate in a pragmatic fashion.  There is no licensing regime for aquaculture currently in operation in Lough Foyle.  The Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Act, 2007 empowered the Loughs Agency to conserve, protect, develop <Col N="235"/>and manage shell fisheries and aquaculture in the Loughs areas, enabling for the first time the introduction of an agreed regulatory aquaculture and shell fisheries regime in Lough Foyle.</P>
        <P>The relevant secondary legislation in relation to aquaculture, when introduced, will enable the Agency to manage the sector.  It will be necessary, however, for the Loughs Agency to secure foreshore licences for the cross-border foreshore areas in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and Food and the Crown Estates Commission, which are the bodies responsible for the management of foreshore in both jurisdictions.  This will facilitate the introduction of a structured management system for aquaculture in the Loughs areas with the objective of achieving sustainable development for the social, economic and environmental benefit of the communities that influence, enjoy and depend on its resource.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide exemptions to gillnet fishermen with boats of less than 15 meters in length similar to the exemptions that he has provided to trawling fishermen with boats of less than 15 meters in length (details supplied); if his attention has been drawn to the fact that these gillnet fishermen are anxious to come to an accommodation with the Department of Transport; if he will meet with a delegation of these gillnet fishermen; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Council Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 introduced restrictions on fishing for cod, haddock and whiting in ICES zones VIa (off the north west coast) from the 1 February 2009 for vessels over 15 metres and for all other vessels from 1 April 2009.   By way of derogation, certain cod avoidance fishing gears are permitted under the EU regulation subject to strict conditions.  No such derogation exists in respect of the use of gillnets as the Commission argued that gill nets have the potential to specifically target cod and generate high mortality rates in an area where scientific advice has been received to indicate cod stocks are under severe threat. </P>
        <P>My colleague, Minister of State Tony Killeen, who has particular responsibility for Fisheries, has met with Fisheries Commissioner Borg this week and raised issues in relation to the Cod Recovery Plan in the Irish Sea &amp; in the North West. In particular, Minister of State Killeen asked for a number of practical changes to the rules that would help alleviate the impacts on the fleet particularly in the North West &amp; in the Irish Sea. These changes included a request that gill net fishing that does not target cod, haddock or whiting in Area VIa should be permitted.   Minister Killeen regularly meets fishing industry representatives and fishermen and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
        <P>Any issues relating to the Department of Transport responsibilities should be addressed to my colleague Minister Noel Dempsey.</P>

      <sTitle>Fallen Animal Collection Scheme.</sTitle>
      <Qst Pid="JoeCarey" ToPid="BrendanSmith" Dept="Agriculture">
        <Qid>204</Qid>
        <asker>Deputy Joe Carey</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest> the plans in place to ensure that farmers here pay an equitable rate for collection and disposal as per their counterparts in Northern Ireland following the suspension of the fallen animals scheme. </Quest>
        <QRef>[25429/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s contribution to the Fallen Animals Scheme ceased with effect from Tuesday 14th April 2009. This was as a result of budgetary constraints and also reflects the greatly reduced incidence of <Col N="236"/>BSE in this country. However I have provided continued financial support for the collection of certain dead animals, in particular bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling, as required under the ongoing national BSE surveillance programme.</P>
        <P>The disposal of dead farm animals is subject to EU Regulations, notably Regulation (EC) No 1774 of 2002. These regulations require that animals, which die on-farm, must generally be disposed of through approved knackeries and rendering plants.  Burial of fallen animals is only permissible under licence in remote areas i.e. islands and listed mountain/bogland areas. Farmers who wish to bury animals on-farm should apply to their local District Veterinary Office for a burial licence.  Farmers may continue to use the existing collection network or, in the alternative, may transport dead animals by prior arrangement to approved knackeries, provided they transport the carcasses in leak-proof, covered containers or vehicles.  It is also a legal requirement on all keepers of bovine animals to notify movements of all bovines (live or dead) off their holdings to my Department.</P>
        <P>With the ending of the Fallen Animals Scheme the cost of collection and rendering for animals not covered by the new scheme is now a matter for negotiation between the individual collectors/rendering plants and their customers.  Within the boundaries of legal requirements my Department is making every effort to facilitate measures to maximise flexibility and enable reduction of costs in the rendering/collection system. This includes allowing cross border trade, permitting direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants, considering removal of some costs currently built into the rendering process and encouraging indigenous use of meat and bone meal (MBM) for energy purposes.</P>

	<P>My officials have examined the applications for the 2009 REPS Scheme received in the Co Cork local offices and have found no record of an application from the person named.</P>
        <P>The total number of applications received for 2009 was in the region of 17,000. The precise number will be available when the applications received in each of the local have been entered on the Department&rsquo;s computer system.  REPS on-farm inspections are carried out throughout the year and are usually completed in early December.</P>
        <P>Of the 12,145 REPS 4 applications lodged in 2007 and 2008, 90.8% have received their 75% payment. Arrangements are being made to ensure that outstanding payments of the first instalment and all payments of the second 25% instalment are made as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy insofar as it relates to aquaculture licences is contained in the following table.   All marine aquaculture licensees are also required to hold a corresponding foreshore licence issued under the Foreshore Act 1933 as amended.  I understand that the Deputy is also requesting details of foreshore leases and licences granted and sought in respect of non-aquaculture activities.  This information is not readily available but is currently being compiled by my Department.  When this has been completed the information will be communicated to the Deputy without delay.</P>

Taking into account that the traditional lobster season has already started, BIM intend that lobsters set aside for v-notching from the start of the season in May will be included under the new scheme.</P>

        <P>Since 2007, my Department has required each of the patron bodies to provide audited accounts for the previous year as a pre-condition to payment of these grants. Audited accounts have been requested from the various patron bodies to allow my Department to pay the 2009 grants.</P>
        <P>Funding to the Islamic Education Board has been withheld by my Department since 2007 because of concerns in relation to the operation and representation of that organisation as a primary management body.

        <P>I can confirm that Department officials met with the management of the school concerned in September 2006.

My Department requested copies of the audited accounts of the school in question in June 2005 for internal examination in the Department and I can also confirm that matters relating to the school accounts were discussed at that meeting.</P>

	<P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.  The procedures provide for three stages to processing appeals, local resolution, facilitation, and finally, if the matter has not been resolved, a hearing.  In respect of the school concerned, six appeals against a refusal to enrol a child have been lodged to date in 2009, of which 4 went to full hearing. None of the appeals were upheld at hearing.  In 2008, three appeals were lodged against refusal to enrol. Two were resolved without the need for a hearing. One appeal went to hearing, but was not upheld.   In 2007, 7 appeals against refused <Col N="243"/>enrolment were lodged, six were resolved prior to hearing. One appeal proceeded to hearing and was upheld.</P>

The school management has been informed of the decision.  A key principle behind the devolution of this Scheme is that responsibility for the management of the project is devolved to the school authority. The school authority can then make use of its local knowledge and presence on the ground to manage the project more effectively and ensure better value for money for the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers received funding under the 2007 Small Schools Scheme.  The school&rsquo;s original grant under the scheme was increased following an appeal for further funding to meet unavoidable extra costs.  </P>
        <P>This school made an application under the SWS 2009 for a number of projects.  However, their original application was not successful.  The school submitted an appeal of this decision, which is under consideration at present.  The school has been contacted for additional information relating to their appeal and, when this is received, the appeal will be considered further and the school informed directly of the outcome.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to primary and post primary schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.</P>
        <P>Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability. A pupil&rsquo;s level of care may diminish over time as the child matures. Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school. This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.</P>
        <P>The NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision. The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE has arranged for its SENOs to review SNA allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts are properly met.</P>
        <P>In this context, my Department recently published circular letter SP ED 0037/2009 on the Department&rsquo;s website www.education.ie. Given the proximity of the end of this school year and, in the light of the fact that those schools  yet to be reviewed will have prepared for the new school year in advance of being reviewed, my Department is allowing exceptional transitional arrangements for schools where the SNA allocation is being adjusted. With the exception of cases where a child with SNA support is leaving a school, schools may, if they so wish, retain the existing cohort of SNAs until 31 January 2010.</P>
        <P>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</P>
        <P>I have arranged for the information provided by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their direct reply.</P>

	<P>The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</P>
        <P>Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order  to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</P>
