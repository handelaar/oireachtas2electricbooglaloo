      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance and concern, namely, the urgent need to develop services for patients with cystic fibrosis, particularly at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and other centres throughout the State and call on the Minister for Health and Children and all Deputies in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to give the maximum support to all cystic fibrosis patients and their families. </P>

	<P>It is proposed to take No. a11, motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions, to be decided without debate; No. 24, the Broadcasting Bill 2008 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stages, which shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; No 1, the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage, which shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 5.30 p.m; Question Time shall be taken at 5.30 p.m. for 75 minutes and in the event of a Private <Col N="238"/>Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken after 45 minutes; and the order shall not resume thereafter.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 6.45 p.m.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are five proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal that the D&aacute;il should sit later than 4.45 p.m. agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. a11, motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions agreed? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>On that issue, I should like to ask whether this is designed to give the Department of Education and Science more time to explain how after decades of saying literacy was its priority, we find that a third of children in disadvantaged schools have severe reading problems.  Despite that, we have no literacy strategy in the Department and it does not even include literacy as an output to be achieved.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a simple procedural motion regarding a ministerial rota.  The Deputy, I am sure, will raise that important issue in a different way. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe it would be possible.  The Department of Education and Science is one of the Departments whose Question Time is being moved in this motion and I believe it is significant that this is happening on a day when this appalling report comes to our attention.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with the rota arrangements agreed?  Agreed. </P>
        <P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 24, Broadcasting Bill 2008, Report and Final Stages, agreed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On that, we have had five guillotines this week.  I want to lay down a marker as regards the seven proposed guillotines in next week&rsquo;s business, in particular in relation to the Financial Services (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, for which the Government has provided at the most three hours for the entire Bill, including Second Stage, Committee and Report Stages.  This includes the right of the Minister for Finance to extend by ministerial order the bank guarantee and there will be no time to debate or examine this properly in the House.  There is no Green Paper or White Paper, no financial information accompanying the Bill which&mdash;&mdash; </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 24, Broadcasting Bill 2008, Report and Final Stages, agreed?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is going to hang like a millstone around the necks of future generations and give the Minister power over something like &euro;60 billion of an increase in the national debt.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with the Report and Final Stages of the Broadcasting Bill.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Government now determined to effectively rule by guillotine, which is the same as ruling by decree?  We are changing now into a D&aacute;il which is ruled by decree and in this case, legislation which is of historic importance and which will double the country&rsquo;s national debt, will be subject to a guillotine and a debate in a total of three hours.  That is not good enough in terms of ordinary taxpayers&rsquo; interests. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="239"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are concerned here with the Broadcasting Bill, Deputy.  Is the Deputy opposing arrangements for dealing with the Broadcasting Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are opposing the principle of guillotine and rule by decree by Fianna F&aacute;il. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Broadcasting Bill, it has now become almost a matter of course that guillotines are part of the Order Paper proposal.  While it has traditionally been the penchant of Governments to employ guillotines in the closing weeks before a summer or Christmas recess, it is now a matter of course.  It must be objected to.  It is not required.  As we demonstrated yesterday, and made reference to the previous week&rsquo;s work, it cannot be accepted.  The Government should accept that Bills should be debated and the sections of Bills, be it Report and Final Stages or Second Stage, as the next proposition on No. 1 will highlight again.  It is unacceptable and should not be proceeded with. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all &ldquo;Scary Carey&rsquo;s&rdquo; fault.  He is at it again. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>While the House can tolerate the occasional use of a guillotine, we have reached a stage where even matters of major importance are not presented with the necessary sort of information to underpin them and there is not the sort of debate required.  The guillotine is undermining proper legislation.  In the United States today a White Paper on the regulation of the financial sector is being published.  The US Legislature will have a long time to consider the options.</P>
        <P>Here it is likely that the very meagre proposals on financial regulation will come in with no White Paper, will be debated in a curtailed debate and will be rammed through with a guillotine.  We must draw a sharp contrast between the legislative approach of other responsible governments and the one this Government is inclined to pursue far too frequently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>To be in order, this relates to the Broadcasting Bill, which is to provide for new governance for the broadcasting industry.  There have been extensive discussions on this and I cannot understand why there would be objections to it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The objection is to the guillotine, not the Bill. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>A considerable amount of legislation has yet to be finalised here and perhaps if we give ourselves more time, in the context of the Order of Business, we could get more work done and have more debate. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very simplistic answer.  The T&aacute;naiste should take her job seriously.</P>
     </Speaker>
        <P Just="Left">Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 24 be agreed to", put and declared carried.</P>
 
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 1, Second Stage of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, agreed to? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed to.  This is the same issue again.  The Executive is using the guillotine as a routine management tool to manage the legislative programme, thereby bypassing this legislative assembly whose constitutional role it is to examine and pass legislation.  It cannot fulfil that role if legislation is routinely guillotined before it is debated fully. <Col N="240"/> There was no need for the particular guillotine we have just dealt with because the Bill is practically completed.  A guillotine was applied yesterday to a Bill and there was no need for it; the Bill would have been passed readily without the guillotine.</P>
        <P>The guillotine is being used as a routine tool and we object to that.  I ask the Government to apply the guillotine only if it is absolutely required, in an emergency.  That is when it is intended to be used.  There were periods of this D&aacute;il during which we debated everything and anything because no legislation was coming forward from the Government.  If it organised its programme properly it would not have this bottleneck at the end of every session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 is a particularly important piece of legislation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it is; that is why it should be debated. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a short Bill.  This is only Second Stage. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very far-reaching and important. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a technical Bill which the Minister of State will take on my behalf.  There was a considerable amount of debate in the Seanad on this.  Deputy Stagg&rsquo;s colleague, the Chairman of the relevant committee, is very anxious to facilitate an in-depth discussion on Committee Stage on the basis that we are all very anxious to have this legislation enacted before the House rises.  Committee Stage, which will be facilitated by the Chairman and members of the committee, would be a more appropriate opportunity to tease out some of the issues.  However we refer now to Second Stage.</P>
  </Speaker>
        <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 1 be agreed to,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
    
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Are the arrangements for Question Time agreed to?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past couple of days we saw a report that the details of 75,000 individual personal bank accounts were stolen in a computer held by Bord G&aacute;is.  These were not encrypted and it will be two weeks before the company will have contacted the individuals concerned.  There are legal weaknesses here.  Will the Government consider enacting Deputy Coveney&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; legislation published last year on this subject?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there promised legislation in this area? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a Government promise of legislation? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That remains to be seen.  It has been promised it in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has made many promises, but it might not have legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No Government legislation is promised.  It is up to the Deputy to order his Private Members&rsquo; time.  </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="241"/>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has indicated it is supportive of legislative measures in this area.  In light of the risk to 75,000 people that has been exposed, the T&aacute;naiste should be examining this seriously.  Fine Gael anticipated the problem well over a year ago. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot deal with the matter now. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps Deputy Coveney will return to this issue.  Is the Government preparing legislation on a bank levy to accompany the National Asset Management Agency Bill?  We are informed that any deficit will be made up by way of a bank levy.  Is that legislation being prepared?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the legislation is on NAMA. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Taoiseach well today in his negotiations in Brussels aimed at obtaining clarification on a number of issues that were of concern to Irish people during the Lisbon treaty referendum.  What is the situation on the guarantees of workers&rsquo; rights, which was one of the matters of particular concern?  This is a matter at EU level but it is also a matter for domestic legislation.  In the review of Towards 2016, which was concluded last September, a number of initiatives were agreed between the Government parties and trade unions on workers&rsquo; rights legislation.</P>
        <P>Two Bills have been on the list of promised legislation for some time, the employment agency regulation Bill and the industrial relations (amendment) Bill.  The employment agency regulation Bill was on the list to be published before summer 2008.  What has happened to it?  When will we see these pieces of legislation?  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that in the context of another Lisbon treaty referendum they would be very helpful to voters, who are deeply concerned about the implications for workers&rsquo; rights in the context of EU legislation and frameworks?</P>
        <P>It is over a year since agreement was reached on the agency workers directives.  There were marches to this House and the Government parties stepped out to reassure workers and their representatives that this would be legislated for, and we have heard nothing about it.  I have another issue to raise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Three pieces of legislation were agreed with the social partners, which my colleague, the Minister of State, brought forward.  One is the Employment Law Compliance Bill, which has been read a Second Time and will be facilitated on Committee Stage by the committee.</P>
        <P>The industrial relations Bill is with the social partners for consideration and once that has been completed, which I hope will be next week, we will be in a position to publish the Bill.  There are two agency Bills.  The agency regulation Bill is ready for publication.  As has been indicated and agreed when the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, negotiated the agency workers directive on behalf of the Government, it will take at least two years for its enactment on the basis that very careful consideration, discussion and deliberation need to take place with the unions on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste may be aware of the unprecedented spate of murders on the fringes of the west and north sides of Dublin resulting in a significant loss of human life.  People are being gunned down in ways that are reminiscent of Al Capone&rsquo;s days in Chicago.  The public living in these areas, including in my constituency feel helpless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a relevant question on legislation?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="242"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government provide time for a debate on the spree of lawlessness, killing and crime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure that is a matter that can be discussed with the Whips.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; that is blighting entire areas of our major cities and towns, linked to the drugs trade?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be an appropriate matter for the Adjournment or the Whips could discuss having a debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the criminal justice (money laundering) Bill to give effect to an EU directive on the matter come before the House?  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill passed Committee Stage last week and Report and Final Stages will be taken next week.  I am informed that more than 30 amendments have been tabled and four hours&rsquo; debating time has been allocated to it next week.  Given that the Bill has been before the House since 2006 and given that on Committee Stage last week entire sections were inserted into the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We can deal with the arrangements when it is properly before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a significant Bill.  The major section introduced last week relates to the tenant purchase of local authority flats.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We can deal with the arrangements when it is properly before the House next week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Opposition spokespersons are entitled to be informed and to be given time to digest this type of information before a Bill, which has been around the House since 2006, gets moved into almost a crisis-driven situation.  Given the Bill&rsquo;s complexities, the T&aacute;naiste should consider two matters.  Can the Report Stage of the Bill be postponed by a week so that Opposition spokespersons can consider the Government amendments and submit their own?  Can more time be given to Report Stage so that the complexities of the Bill can be discussed at length?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is being guillotined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before proper proposals are put to the House on that matter, I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will give the Deputy&rsquo;s intervention consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The money laundering Bill will be taken this session.  The Minister has made a memorandum available to the Opposition spokespersons on the complexity of this issue.  I am sure we can facilitate some discussions if there are particular issues between the Minister and the officials.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I was involved in a meeting with Co-operation Ireland regarding the withdrawal of the &euro;3 million capital funding from the Middletown Centre for Autism, which was part of the Good Friday Agreement.  When can we have discussion on North-South co-<Col N="243"/>operation in the D&aacute;il?  Could we at least have a discussion on the amendment Bill to the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Act 1998 to allow us to discuss that?</P>

I am pleased to see the Ministers for Transport, and Arts, Sport and Tourism present.

	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm that as has been reported, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, intends introducing an amendment of the Constitution Bill to facilitate a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty and that Bill is to be addressed in the House in the coming week?  Will it at least be published next week?  What is the timeframe for the legislation?  Does the Government intend to press it through before the summer recess?  Will the Bill facilitate putting to the electorate the exact same Lisbon treaty on which we have already passed judgment?  I understand the text will not be altered in any way either by so-called legal guarantees or by declarations.</P>
        <P>We have debated the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the House passed a unanimous motion, which was very welcome.  Everyone is to be commended on the approach to that matter.  On the publication of the report of the Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation into clerical sexual abuse of children in the Dublin archdiocese, will that report also be debated on the Floor of the House?</P>

	<P>I have one last item to ask about, with your patience a Leas Cheann Comhairle.  However, on the matter of the report into clerical sexual abuse in the Dublin archdiocese, will the Government facilitate address of that report here?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government met and approved the wording of the Twenty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  As the Deputy knows we would like to get the matter initiated within the House as quickly as possible.  Of course that is on the basis of a satisfactory outcome of the deliberations today and tomorrow.  It is the intention that this legislation would go before the House and be complete before we rise.</P>
        <P>The Government has not received the report into clerical sexual abuse in the Dublin archdiocese, but it will consider it and make a decision afterwards.  The child care Bill will be taken in this session.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Until the end of last year the Government planned to publish the education (Ireland) Bill to establish a body to register the provision of education services including the teaching of English to foreign students.  The Bill was to be published in 2009 but the Minister for Education and Science decided to shelve it.  The Europol report last summer stated that educational establishments have gained importance in facilitating illegal immigration into the country and Members heard yesterday that language schools in Dublin are now breeding grounds for prostitution.  I understand the Minister has an alternative Bill, No. 60, the Qualifications, (Education and Training) Bill.  When will that be published?  In light of the comments yesterday will it be expedited to deal with what is now major exploitation using a loophole in our immigration law affecting the language schools in Dublin?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought Deputy Deenihan was raising an issue about the Kerry defence last Saturday. </P>
        <P>Last February, the Committee on Public Accounts, PAC, issued an interim report on the irregularities, to put it mildly, in F&Aacute;S.  We issued several key recommendations and sent them to the T&aacute;naiste but to my knowledge no action has been taken on any of those recommendations.  According to some media outlet, the T&aacute;naiste is preparing legislation on the reconstitution of the F&Aacute;S board and the reduction of numbers on the board.  When can we expect to see that legislation and when will there be action on some of the other recommendations?  The public, the taxpayers, were aghast at some of the disclosures and at the fact that no action has been taken yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised in that area? </P>

	<P>How many will be sacked? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise another issue.  PAC also wrote to the Minister for Finance to ask that the roles of the Comptroller and Auditor General and PAC be taken into <Col N="247"/>consideration in the drafting of the National Assets Management Agency, NAMA, legislation to protect the taxpayers&rsquo; interest in this potentially massive cost to them.</P>
        <P>Can I have an answer to both questions, and in respect of the second will the Government accept the recommendations of PAC that it and the Comptroller and Auditor General would have a key role in monitoring the activities of NAMA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I indicated to the Deputy privately last week that I intend to introduce a new legislative framework for F&Aacute;S.  Many of the PAC recommendations have been enacted and dealt with.  We have to finalise consideration of further reports.</P>
        <P>The second question is a matter for the Minister for Finance to consider.  I will indicate to him that the Deputy raised it today.  I cannot give a commitment on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard Allen</NameTxt>

	<P>I hope it is a different question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.  It arises from the sloppy treatment of sensitive personal data by Bord G&aacute;is and the Health Service Executive, HSE, in the past two days which has resulted in bank account details of 75,000 people and the personal details of nine families being compromised. </P>
        <P>Last October Fine Gael published a data protection disclosure Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must ask a question. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to it.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has allowed other people to have a preamble. </P>
        <P>In response to that Bill the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform set up a data protection review group and promised it would result in a legislative response from Government to cover data disclosure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle should let me finish.  It deals with data protection, disclosure and, potentially, encryption obligations, the absence of which has caused the latest data protection breach.  A legislative response was promised and I want to know where it is now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The promised legislation will be finalised fairly soon.  It is expected in this session, the Communications (Retention of Data) Bill is based on an EU directive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to resume in mid-possession because I have to pick up the threads again.  While there are difficulties and losses with the current system, it is the most effective system we have.  If an alternative system can be introduced, we will certainly do that.  At this stage, it is not available and I cannot accept the amendments regarding the television licence. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that the television licence fee has served us well in some ways in raising money.  However, if we know there are inefficiencies in place and there is something like an incentive to evade paying a television licence fee, then we have a responsibility to respond to that and to change the policy.  I do not want us to abandon the existing mechanism until we have an agreed new system in place.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s concern with my amendment was that I was deleting the legal base for a continuation of the television licence fee.  That is not the case.  It states clearly at the end of my amendment No. 129: &ldquo;Nothing in <i>subsection (1) </i>shall affect the existing mechanisms of television licence fees during the preparation of the report under <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo;.  I am saying that we should leave the existing system in place, but let us force the timescale for a review.  The Minister states that he is reviewing this and that if a better system comes up, he will look at it, but that is not a proactive way to deal with the issue.  He knows that nobody out there will go to the time and expense of putting in place a watertight alternative revenue raising proposal to fund public service broadcasting in Ireland, unless he forces the pace on it.  That is what my amendments are trying to do.</P>
        <P>Everybody accepts that the current system is outdated, is not working as it should do and is too expensive.  It would be great to tell households that we will reduce the contribution they make to public service broadcasting, because that is what we would be doing here.  The 80% of those who are paying their licence fees are also paying for the 20% of those who are not paying them.  We could have a system that would require all households and businesses to make a contribution towards public service broadcasting.  In Greece, people pay their public service broadcasting levy via their electricity bill.  There is no cost of collection, as the fees automatically get deducted.  That may not be the most appropriate solution for Ireland, but there are solutions out there and unless we force the pace to find those solutions we will continue to drift along with a very inefficient system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Coveney.  I regret the fact that the Minister is not dealing with this in any way that recognises the problem, which is that we have an antiquated system.  Twenty per cent of the people do not pay at all, while 52 people have ended up in jail for non-payment.  There are advertisements that inform us that 18,000 households are visited every month.  I do not believe that for a minute.  The reality is that most people are not caught because one in five of us do not get caught, and if we are caught, we do not pay.</P><Col N="252"/>
        <P>This is a practical issue about funding public service broadcasting.  We must have the flow of money.  It should be related in some way to the realities of technological advances.  The technology will keep changing rapidly.  Computers, television sets, iPods and so on are part and parcel of all households.  They will increasingly be part of all households and there are other ways that are simpler, more practical and more efficient in getting a return in terms of public service broadcasting.  One example is Greece and Germany also has a different system of payment.</P>
        <P>We have spent an enormous amount of time on the Broadcasting Bill but it does not amount to a hill of beans.  There are a few changes.  The new authority will cost the same as the old authority but will have many functions.  There will be modest changes, with a film channel and an Oireachtas channel sometime.  We will not have the diaspora channel, as required in law, until whenever.  There is a requirement for the Minister to deal with this issue.  It would be a good legacy of a Minister who is on top of his brief to take on this challenge and accept that Ireland must move towards the digital world in a way that will ensure people pay their fair share in ensuring public service broadcasting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McManus is correct in referring to Germany, which introduced legislation that applies a licence fee to an Internet link in 2007.  There is a similar measure in Denmark, where an Internet connection is charged a licence fee.  The deliberate decision taken is that we want to create a culture that encourages new technologies and this is not best served by applying a licence fee to Internet access. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister comparing us to Denmark and Germany? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those countries have done that.  We felt it was not the best strategy.  It may be the strategy in the future as matters evolve and the nature of the platform changes as the nature of broadcasting changes.  I am not saying we should not do it but it might be better not to do it quickly.  We should give these technologies some room to evolve and develop and to allow consumers to adapt in a range of ways.  It is not technologically certain yet. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Why link it with any item?  Why have the debate about televisions, laptops or PDAs?  Why do we link the funding of public service broadcasting, which includes radio and television, to ownership of an item? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a choice.  If one does not have a television, one does not have to pay.  Otherwise, there would be a citizens charge applied to every citizen in the State.  There is always a choice as to whether one uses television services and purchases a licence.  If one does not, the licence fee does not apply.  By maintaining the current system, there are difficulties but, according to RTE and our nearest neighbours, the UK, it is still the best way of collecting funds.  We will review it.  It would be a major review and would take time and require changes in legislation.  That can be done but it is not the priority.  The priorities are to get DTT in place, to ensure broadband is available across the country and allow these technologies to develop.  That works better without us charging for them. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What is good for Britain is not necessarily good for us.  Saying that the UK has examined this and has come to the conclusion that they should retain the licence fee and attach it to television ownership does not mean we should follow suit.  The point is not that we should be charging for Internet connections or treat computers as televisions and charge for ownership of the technology but that we should seek a contribution from households or businesses, however it is structured, but not link it to ownership of an item.  The Minister <Col N="253"/>says that someone can make a choice by not having a television and not paying the licence fee but they can watch the television on their computer.  They do not need to get a television but get the benefit of public service broadcasting over the radio.  We have a hang-up about funding public service broadcasting by attaching a charge to television ownership.  To force that, we have potentially an army of people checking 18,000 households, knocking on doors to see if there are television licences attached to ownership. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>So they tell us. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The best case scenario is that they are doing that and, if they are, it is a major waste of money.  If they are not doing it, they are not enforcing the law.  Either way, it is a farce to employ people to knock on doors.  For a start, they cannot get into most apartment complexes.  I am not prescribing the solution but asking the Minister to make a statement in this legislation that we will have a report and recommendations on this issue within 12 months.  If the recommendation is that we stick with the current system, so be it.  Then we can accept that what is good for Britain is good for Ireland in this area but I do not accept that we should not examine how we fund public service broadcasting in an Irish context.  For a start, we will reduce the amount people must pay and will reduce the cost of implementing it.  We should be able to reduce to &euro;2 million the &euro;12 million it costs currently to collect &euro;200 million.  One sees this when considering what it costs the Revenue to raise taxes.  I hoped the legacy of this Minister would be one of reform because he is a reforming thinker in many ways, particularly in the energy area.  This could be a positive reform that the Opposition would co-operate with so that we have a more efficient mechanism for funding public service broadcasting.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that RTE expressed a view that it would like a continuation of the television licence fee for funding.  The reason behind that is that the primary concern of RTE is to see assurances that a lump sum, separate to general taxation, is put into the public service broadcasting so that RTE does not suffer from reductions in the Exchequer.  That is a valid concern and any system we set up would need to take this into account.  We would need to ring-fence any levy or proposed taxation for public service broadcasting for that area to give guarantees that it would not be subject to the political whim of a Minister under pressure to make savings.  That is a practical problem that can be resolved.  That is the motivation behind the comments of RTE on this matter.  It is not that RTE supports linking television ownership with a licence that contributes to the levy.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 146:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 150, line 40, after &ldquo;adult&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or media&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Media literacy, which aims to increase our awareness of the nature of the many forms of media messages encountered in our everyday lives, is increasingly recognised both here and across Europe as a key element in the economic, cultural and democratic development of society.  Amendment No. 146 proposes to extend the remit of the broadcasting fund to explicitly permit the funding of new television and radio programmes which advance media literacy.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 147 proposed by Deputy Coveney relates to the extent to which the broadcasting fund should fund news and current affairs programming.  There are strong arguments against extending the scope of the broadcasting fund to such general news and current affairs programming, the first being that news and current affairs output should not be dependent on the success or otherwise of funding applications for grants from the broadcasting fund.</P>
        <P>Such a provision would fail the additionality test, given the existing news and current affairs requirements on certain categories of broadcasters who are gifted use to the valuable radio spectrum.  The final and principal argument against this is that such a provision would diminish the overall funding pool for the types of programming which have made the broadcasting <Col N="255"/>fund the successful venture that it has been to date.  As such, I do not propose to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 148 proposed by Deputy McManus proposes the ring-fencing of a specific amount of the broadcasting fund for the purposes of developing community radio.  The Bill as amended contains a range of measures to assist the development of community radio in Ireland, including, <i>inter alia</i>, empowering the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to award temporary contracts of up to 100 days to community radio broadcasters in section 68 and providing that the BAI, in preparing a scheme under the broadcasting fund, may have regard to the specific development needs of community broadcasters as set out in section 154(5).</P>
        <P>These provisions, along with the increase in the proportion of television licence fee revenues allocated to the broadcasting fund, will assist the development of the community radio sector in Ireland.  As such, I do not propose to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In amendment No. 147 I make the case that we would delete the section relating to the broadcasting fund, which states that the fund may not provide funding for programmes which are produced primarily for news or current affairs.  News and current affairs programmes are continuing to make perhaps the most valuable contribution to public service broadcasting in Ireland.  In RTE&rsquo;s case, it is generally accepted that the news and current affairs element is of a very high standard and the same could be said for TV3, which has made a significant effort to improve its news and current affairs programming, particularly late in the evenings.</P>
        <P>It is a welcome development that not only does the public service broadcaster consider it part of its remit to do this but a commercial broadcaster like TV3 sees it as an attractive proposition to develop news and current affairs programmes in a way that would promote an increase in viewership.  It has done that through news and current affairs programmes.</P>
        <P>When considering the broadcasting fund as a pool of money, we should encourage independent production companies as well as established broadcasters to compete for it in making programmes.  We must of course examine matters like nature, the environment, history, the Irish language and other issues abroad which would be of interest and relevance to the Irish population.  We have the list just about right now after discussions, consultation and the Minister taking ideas on board and so on.</P>
        <P>To prohibit either an independent company or broadcaster from making an application on the basis of an innovative, clever way of addressing current affairs or news is too limiting.  The bar should be raised pretty high for a broadcaster to make the case to get funding in this category but to delete it altogether is wrong.  We should be encouraging news and current affairs programmes developed by independent broadcasters in quirky new ways that will get a message across.</P>
        <P>Irish production companies and presenters are particularly good at this.  There is a series of Irish examples, including Dara &Oacute; Briain and others like him, who have been very successful outside Ireland in addressing current affairs in a humorous or comedic way.  We can see the kinds of projects developing at times which we should potentially support with the broadcasting fund.  I would be opposed to an application, for example, from TV3 news to get funding from the broadcasting fund but we should not write off news and current affairs because we are happy with current content from RTE and TV3.</P>
        <P>Whatever about news, current affairs can be addressed in new and clever ways that will attract a different audience, and this should be facilitated through the broadcasting fund.  There <Col N="256"/>should at least be an open door to applications in making that case.  That is what I aim to achieve with this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 148 seeks a specific amount allocated to facilitate the growth of community radio.  I do not want to labour the point because we debated this earlier in the context of community television.  In dealing with public service broadcasting, the Minister quite often states that we need Irish stories told to Irish people.  I do not disagree with that point.  If one considers the kind of contact and expression that occurs at local level through local radio stations, there is no more important place for those stories to be told.  This is one aspect of local radio.  Community radio and television have a particular dimension that needs to be supported and acknowledged formally in some way other than the token references contained in the Bill.  Its main dimension is that it is participatory; it involves local communities.</P>
        <P>When I visited the Digital Hub recently in the Liberties, I was impressed with the work of a local community radio station based there.  Many of its operators were quite elderly.  While technological advance is very welcome, the danger of its march is that marginalised communities will get left behind.  We must recognise this in some real way rather than just offering tokens.</P>
        <P>The great strength of community radio and television programming is that it involves the very people of that community.  Whether it is radio or television, I believe it has a good future and beneficial role to play, particularly as there is an increasing sense of being alienated in society with the loss of community being a constant refrain.  It is a strength and a resource, not something to be given lip-service.  We should be encouraging it.</P>
        <P>I am not trying to be prescriptive in the amount given to such programming.  Instead I am requesting the laying down of the principle in the Bill that community radio and television offers the unique dimension of a participatory nature that other forms of broadcasting do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I agree with Deputy McManus, to date more than half of the money for radio programming in the broadcasting fund has gone to community radio.  Sometimes we must be careful not to set quotas or restrictions which could affect the fund&rsquo;s flexibility.</P>
        <P>Deputy Coveney is correct about the importance of news and current affairs to any broadcaster&rsquo;s schedule.  A Committee Stage amendment opened up the definition of radio and television programmes considered suitable for the fund to those which raised public awareness and understanding of global issues impacting on countries other than Ireland.  Many international current affairs issues could be raised through this.</P>
        <P>The original requirements put in place 20 years ago on news broadcasting for independent broadcasters were initially seen as a burden but have become their core asset.  The news and current affairs shows attract and hold listeners.  Television broadcasters see news and current affairs programmes as expensive and have them on late at night when there is not a large audience.  However, it is the heart of a station, giving a mix and a balance that is important and what viewers want.  Viewers need to trust and know that the broadcaster has some depth to it with some fair, open and honest consideration of current affairs.</P>
        <P>All these requirements are on a statutory footing which are enforced and extended in this Bill.  The new codes we are introducing will require such news and current affairs broadcasting to be fair, impartial and a major part of programming.  I do not believe we need to divert moneys from the broadcasting fund when that objective is already achieved in other parts of the legislation.</P>

	<P>I accept I may be out of my depth on the technical side of this amendment.  It distinguishes between broadcasting that occurs on commercial shipping and fisheries vessels such as that for navigation, communications between vessels, the Coast Guard and so forth.  There is a grey area, however, with privately owned vessels.  Anyone lucky enough to own a sailing yacht or motor boat will have a modern communications capacity on their vessel for GPS, chart-plotting systems, satellite links for weather forecast updates and so forth.  Section 180(1), which is not being amended, states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" Just="Left">. . . &lsquo;broadcast&rsquo; means the transmission, relaying or distributing by wireless telegraphy of communications, sounds, signs, visual images or signals, intended for direct reception by the general public whether such communications, sounds, signs, visual images or signals are actually received or not; . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">While I accept it is better to have shipping broadcasts coming under the remit of the Minister for Transport, who will be responsible for communications from privately owned vessels?</P>
        <P>I assume the new authority will not be responsible because that would be farcical.  Presumably it is not the Department of Transport either, because the latter has no role in respect of privately owned leisure vessels.  There appears to be a vacuum in this regard on which I seek clarity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This issue does not pertain to broadcasting but is a safety issue between the Department of Transport and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  My understanding is that given its marine safety function, the Department of Transport would be obliged to cover private vessels.  This is a difficult question because it is not easy to police, as one also has vessels entering and leaving Irish waters.  While this amendment delineates the powers between ComReg and the Department of Transport in a broad sense, the specific details of who should police it is a matter for those bodies.  I believe the Department of Transport will have responsibility.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">Amendment No. 158 provides for a change in copyright law to afford commercial DTT platform providers the same opportunities as cable, IPTV and MMDS operators and on similar terms.  This amendment involves the complex interface between commercial DTT issues, copyright law and broadcasting policy and accordingly has been developed in close co-operation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure compatibility with copyright matters.  While this amendment was withdrawn on Committee Stage, it has been reintroduced as it is considered necessary to provide a fair environment for commercial DTT.  Cable and MMDS services are closed service offerings that are only accessible to the subscribers of the service.  In the same way, the commercial DTT service also will be a subscription-based service, which is only accessible to its subscribers.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment amends section 2 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 to ensure that the rules governing the acquisition of copyright by DTT operators are the same as those which apply to cable, MMDS and IPTV services.  While the changes are to the definitions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, the effective change is through the existing section 174 of that Act.  The inclusion of DTT retransmission together with MMDS and cable in the definition of &ldquo;cable programme service&rdquo;, puts DTT retransmission on the same footing as MMDS and cable.  Section 174 reflects an EU directive, namely, the cable and satellite directive of 1993, which requires member states to have such rules for cable and MMDS.  DTT, of course, did not exist as a technology in 1993.</P>
        <P>Section 174 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act provides a mechanism for cable operators to retransmit channels from other jurisdictions without directly clearing rights with the rights holders.  This law differentiates between the retransmission service offered by the cable operator and the broadcast or transmission services offered by broadcasters.  The cable service is a closed, subscriber based service and is not accessible free-to-air to the general public.  Under these circumstances, &ldquo;retransmission rights&rdquo; can be acquired, which provide the right to <Col N="261"/>retransmit the programmes in a controlled manner to the subscriber base.  For a cable service, a copyright collection agency is responsible for managing the acquisition of cable retransmission rights between the rights holders and the cable operator.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 158 seeks to extend this legislation to provide a similar mechanism for the management of retransmission rights over subscriber-based DTT networks.  This will mean that when channels from other jurisdictions are broadcast on the commercial subscription DTT platform, the same collection agency approach will apply.  This will help ensure the development of DTT in Ireland and allow for a level playing field <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the cable and MMDS multichannel offerings.  Having withdrawn this amendment on Committee Stage, my Department has, in co-operation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its legal advisers, given detailed further consideration to the issues.  Such consideration included examining the position in other EU countries in which such a legal regime already exists.</P>
        <P>As Members are aware, certain Irish broadcasters expressed concern about the amendment as tabled on Committee Stage.  Those concerns have been listened to and the amendment now tabled has been changed significantly.  I refer to the stipulation that services must be encrypted.  This will draw a distinction between channels from other member states, which may be retransmitted free-to-air and which may be encrypted, as they are pay services.  When a channel from another member state is retransmitted free-to-air on DTT in Ireland, it cannot avail of the benefit of this amendment, whereas it can when it has been encrypted.  I believe this draws the necessary distinction between broadcast rights for Irish free-to-air broadcasts and for non-Irish retransmissions to meet the concerns raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is accurate to state that this amendment was the subject of enormous concern on Committee Stage, particularly from TV3.  I acknowledge the Department has spoken in detail to the station&rsquo;s representatives to try to allay their fears.  For the record, TV3&rsquo;s fears were based on its expenditure of up to &euro;50 million to secure exclusive rights to broadcast programming in Ireland over the next five years in fields such as drama, sport, situation comedy or whatever.  As a result, TV3 had a legitimate expectation that it held exclusive rights for the broadcast of the programming for which it had purchased the rights over the next four to five years.  This amendment potentially had proposed that on the introduction of DTT, broadcasters based outside Ireland would be allowed to retransmit programmes in Ireland without being obliged either to have exclusivity rights for such programming or to compensate Irish broadcasters that may have purchased exclusive rights to the same programming for the next four or five years.  Essentially, the money spent by a commercial broadcaster such as TV3 to nail down exclusive broadcasting rights would become worthless and a number of people from TV3 expressed a genuine fear that this simply would put the station out of business.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This was the reason Deputy McManus and I were determined not to allow the Minister to simply push through this amendment without much detailed further consideration.  To be fair, the Minister has given this matter much consideration, as have his officials, who supplied me with a useful detailed briefing note in this regard for which I thank them.  Is it correct to state the fundamental difference between the Minister&rsquo;s proposals on Committee Stage and what is now proposed is that the exclusive rights issue is only being done away with in the context of encrypted commercially-run multiplexes?  Is it correct to state that foreign broadcasters will not be able to avail of the free-to-air multiplex to retransmit programming to which, for example, TV3 may have the exclusive rights to broadcast in Ireland?  In other words, those who receive free-to-air television will still only be able to access programming for which TV3 has purchased exclusive rights from that station.  The only compromise in that regard would be if one were to pay an additional sum to One Vision, or whatever organisation will be providing the commercial DTT product in the future, to have <Col N="262"/>an encrypted service broadcast into one&rsquo;s home.  Is this analysis correct?  This is an issue of fundamental importance and I cannot overstate how concerned one broadcaster in particular is about this amendment.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.2- ?>
        <P>If we introduce legislation that puts the only independent television broadcaster in Ireland out of business, essentially, that will be an enormous error.  We cannot afford to do that.  I appreciate that the Minister has considered this issue in detail.  He has examined what is being done elsewhere as part of the transition from analogue to digital.  I accept that it is a complex matter.  The digital terrestrial television service about which we are talking is restricted to the island of Ireland.  It is not an international broadcast system like Sky Television.  In the case of the new digital service, we cannot impose the kind of legal restrictions that apply to the analogue service when RTE, TV3 or anybody else purchases the exclusive right to broadcast a certain programme.  Broadcasters are entitled to take a punt on programmes in the hope of increasing their advertising revenues and viewing figures, etc.  We need to make sure we do not fundamentally undermine that principle in this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for taking the time to consider the points that have been made.  The alarm bells went off when this proposal was originally discussed.  Some of the concerns that continue to exist have been outlined by Deputy Coveney.  I propose to refer to a note I have received, which relates to certain legal issues that may arise.  I appreciate that the Minister may refute the arguments made in the note, now that he has had a chance to examine the matter.  I want to highlight a couple of points that are made in the note and may be a factor in this debate.  I was not aware of the points in question until I received the note.</P>
        <P>The question of whether this measure is legal under EU law has been raised.  The Minister is trying to define &ldquo;DTT retransmission&rdquo; as &ldquo;cable retransmission&rdquo; even though the EU directive on cable retransmission clearly sets out that they are separate.  I assume the Minister can respond to that fairly basic point.  As Deputy Coveney has said, the Minister is proposing to take away certain exclusive rights that are granted under the copyright directive.  Perhaps the Minister can confirm whether the right of a copyright holder to be able to own the exclusive rights to broadcast certain material will be affected by the Bill before the House.</P>
        <P>As a representative of Wicklow, where Ardmore Studios are based, I have concerns about another matter that was raised in the note that was sent to me.  I want to be absolutely certain that this legislation will not have a negative impact in the general area of international law and trade relations.  It has been argued that the Minister&rsquo;s proposals could well result in the US trade department putting Ireland on its &ldquo;section 301&rdquo; list, which is a list of countries the US is wary of because they do not respect intellectual property rights.  Ireland was on that list until 2001, when the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 was enacted.  It would not be a good idea to discourage US investment in the current economic climate.  The measure we are discussing could have a particular impact on US investment in film-making at Ardmore Studios.  The Minister needs to give us a firm commitment that he is satisfied the concerns raised in the note that was sent to me will not arise.  It is obvious that TV3 has a particular interest in this matter.  We all recognise that those involved in TV3 are running a business.  We need to be conscious of the status of this legislation under EU law and the implications it will have on the intellectual property rights of US film products.  I ask the Minister to deal with the concerns that have arisen on foot of this proposal.  As far as I know, none of those concerns has been alleviated by the changes made by the Minister.  Perhaps he can advise us to the contrary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The fundamental point made by Deputy Coveney in his analysis is similar to the point I am making.  He is correct to say that a change has been made since <Col N="263"/>Committee Stage.  These provisions cannot apply to a company that is broadcasting on the Irish DTT platform on a free-to-air basis.  They are exclusively available to companies that have encrypted, subscriber-based systems in place.</P>
        <P>I wish to respond to the point made by Deputy McManus about EU law.  We have engaged in detailed analysis of this highly complex legal area.  We believe this aspect of the legislation is firmly within the EU legal framework.  Examples from other countries back up that point.  We have received detailed advice on the matter from the Office of the Attorney General and other sources.</P>
        <P>I am not quite certain of the point being made by Deputy McManus in her comments on the question of exclusive rights.  The measure we are discussing relates to retransmission, rather than to primary rights for Ireland.  Such rights will not be affected.  We are talking about programmes that are retransmitted after the primary transmission was in another country.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question about exclusive rights.</P>
        <P>Deputy McManus&rsquo;s third point related to the possibility of this legislation giving rise to concern in the US.  We have to bear in mind that rights will continue to apply.  The only thing we are legislating for is the method of collecting and dispersing rights.  International property rights will not be undermined in any way.  In a sense, we are extending the existing system that is in place for cable and MMDS operators.  This will not subvert or undermine the international property rights that are in place.  It seeks to ensure that they are collected and delivered effectively on the DTT platform, just as they are in the case of cable and MMDS services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>A certain element of trust is required when the Minister says that he and his Department have got this right.  I am concerned about the effect this proposal will have on this country&rsquo;s only national independent television broadcaster.  Of all the amendments being made in this legislation, this is the one that has exercised the broadcaster in question &mdash; I do not refer to RTE or TG4 &mdash; to the greatest extent.  We need to be very cautious in this area.  We need to examine what has been done in other countries, to make sure we get it right.  As we try to facilitate the development of a large multiplex system with a large number of channels and programmes, while avoiding long and drawn-out legal negotiations, we need to ensure that we do not treat one of this country&rsquo;s broadcasters in an unfair manner.  That perception is continuing to come from TV3, although some of its concerns have been allayed.  The Minister has assured us that programmes in respect of which exclusivity on a free-to-air multiplex service has been purchased cannot be retransmitted without some form of compensation or fee being paid.  We have an obligation to lay down a warning in respect of the real concerns that TV3 continues to have.  It is important that we flag such concerns in case this legislation results in the kind of calamitous response some people are predicting.  The Minister&rsquo;s advice needs to be properly tested so we can be confident that it is correct.</P>

        <P>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.</P>
   
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies opposite for facilitating the passage of this Bill, which has been a long time coming.  Broadcasting is one of the most difficult areas to legislate.  Its regulation is not easy.  It is probably one of the most sensitive and important areas in political life.  As we have seen in the detail of the Bill, issues often arise in broadcasting that are highly complex and highly charged when dealing with issues such as religious advertising.  It is probably one of the most difficult areas to legislate for, but the legislation is of consequence.    </P>
        <P Just="Left">Similarly, the regulation by State authorities of broadcasters is hugely important and sensitive.  What one person can see as a good and accurate news report, another person can see as defaming.  This Bill provides for a fundamental shift towards having a single regulatory system treating public and independent broadcasters similarly.  It also provides for the developing of codes and practices of such regulation in a way that will give the new regulator real authority and a clear sense of direction as to their work.  That will include the oversight of funding of public service broadcasters, which is important now that we have a market where there are both independent and public service broadcasters.  The Bill provides for the introduction of new codes, strengthening areas such as food advertising and other new codes which we need to continue to enforce and update.  It introduces new rights of reply schemes, which are important for people who have been injured by broadcasting.  A range of measures are provided for, the detail of which I will not go into.  The legislation will strengthen community broadcasting and broadcasting in general with the potential introduction of Oireachtas TV, an Irish film channel and it will also strengthen the provisions in terms of the development of DTT and IPTV.</P>
        <P>We need to constantly return to this broadcasting legislation as it is an area that will continue to evolve as technology changes.  I am sure this will not be the last broadcasting Bill and that it will be further amended.</P>
        <P>I commend in particular the Department officials who worked long and hard on this legislation, Mr. Kevin O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. Bill  Morrissey who are present and everyone else.  They carry out their work in an exemplary fashion.  I very much commend them and thank them for their consideration.  It is their job to tease out some of these highly complex and difficult issues.  I welcome the support for the Bill.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise one small procedural issue.  I have been asked by the Whips office to raise with the Deputies opposite the possibility of bringing forward the taking of Question Time this afternoon should the debate on the Companies (Amendment) Bill conclude early.  The Whips office has asked if we would facilitate them by taking oral questions from approximately 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. rather than at 5.30 p.m.  If the debate on the other legislation concludes early and if the Deputies opposite are willing to facilitate this proposal, I would be happy to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>That would have to be agreed. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I acknowledge the work done by the Minister and his civil servants.  I am sure he is right that we will have another broadcasting Bill.  I have no doubt that it will set up one regulator across the telecommunications industry.  I am sure the civil servants will have that to look forward to, as perhaps will the Minister, although he may not be in the position he is now, but who knows?</P><Col N="268"/>
        <P>There have been improvements in this Bill.  I acknowledge that the Minister has listened to the Opposition in a way that does not always happen.  Sometimes Ministers do not seem to hear anything that is said during a debate except their own side of the case.  I acknowledge that the Minister took on board some but by no means all the points made on Committee Stage and came back with improvements.</P>
        <P>One point he did not make, which has to be in his favour, is the fact that the Oireachtas has a role in the selection process for appointments.  That is a valuable change.  The door is opening slightly with the passage of this Bill but it is significant that it is opening.  It is a welcome step and a sign that the there is a recognition that the old ways are not the best ways.</P>
        <P>In terms of Question Time today, unfortunately, I have a commitment in my constituency at 3 p.m.  I presumed that Question Time would not commence until 5.30 p.m.  I would be more than happy to be back here by 4.45 p.m. if that is of any help. I planned my day around Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the last item that was raised by the Minister and Deputy McManus, I would be happy to proceed with Question Time as soon as possible, but I respect that Deputy McManus has planned her day around it being scheduled to commence later.  The sooner questions could be taken, the better it would be for me.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the Bill, consideration has been long, drawn out and detailed.  I thank the Minister&rsquo;s officials as well for the briefings we were given when we asked for them.  A genuine effort was made to keep the Opposition informed on most details and that is welcome.</P>
        <P>I also acknowledge that the Minister took on board much of what, although not everything, we asked for on Committee Stage.  I am disappointed this legislation is not more ambitious in terms of the reform it seeks to bring about.  We could have made much braver attempts to put in place a more modern, effective, cost-effective in particular, and fairer system of funding public service broadcasting or at least given an indication in the legislation that we would do that.  It was decided not to do that.  That is being overly cautious and represents a missed opportunity.</P>
        <P>I recognise that other positive reforms are being introduced in regard to the new channels being proposed.  The film channel in particular is a brave step by the Minister in an attempt to support Irish film and Irish film industry.  That is a positive measure.  The funding around that may not be as straightforward as the Minister has suggested, but we will wait and see how that develops in the months and years ahead.</P>
        <P>I made a point during the debate on Second Stage, which Deputy McManus has carried forward more recently and in a far more proactive way than I have.  The idea of having a single communications regulator that would also deal with broadcasting makes sense in Ireland and it is a pity it was not fully developed at a much earlier stage.  This is something that will probably happen in time; ComReg will be the regulator for transmission and facilitation of media through broadband but will also manage content, similarly to the UK&rsquo;s Ofcom.  I welcome the fact that we have now moved away from having separate regulatory regimes for public and private sector broadcasting.  It is important that we apply the same standards to RTE as to TV3 and others.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the efforts the Minister has made to protect children in advertising by setting up new codes and giving powers to the new authority.  This is genuinely welcome.  We should have gone further and applied the same rationale to alcohol advertising that we apply to junk <Col N="269"/>food advertising which targets children.  This is something to which we may return at a later stage.</P>
        <P>This has been an interesting process that probably would have finished six months ago if it were not for the crises we have had to deal with in the House, which distracted legislators from Bills such as this one.  This resulted in an embarrassing situation in which RTE did not have a board for six or eight weeks at the start of the year because this Bill had not been finalised.  Some lessons have been learned in terms of process.  I thank the Minister for accepting more amendments than most other Ministers would have for such legislation and I encourage him to continue to consider the kind of reform we have been proposing, even though it has not been part of this Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I am pleased to bring the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 before the House.  This is a targeted and focused Bill which deals with a small number of company law issues that require immediate attention.  The Bill arises from recent experiences in the enforcement of company law in the banking sector in particular.  In response to these developments, the Government decided earlier this year to introduce a small number of important changes to company law and determined that these should be put into action immediately.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that a major project is ongoing to consolidate and reform all existing company law into a single text.  Work on this project is well advanced and it is my intention to publish a significant Bill containing some 1,250 sections early next year.  However, the Government considered it necessary to implement the focused changes in today&rsquo;s short Bill in advance of that.  I thank Deputies for facilitating the early consideration of this legislation.</P>
        <P>The objective of this short Bill is to provide in primary legislation a framework to support the Director of Corporate Enforcement in his efforts to enforce compliance with company law by ensuring he has the range of powers required to support him in this task.  It will improve the transparency of loans made by licensed banks to their directors and persons connected with them.  In addition, it will amend certain existing provisions relating to Irish-registered non-resident companies to deal with concerns of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>In drawing up the amendments contained in this Bill, extensive consultation took place with the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  His experience of the operation of company law on the ground and of the issues that arise when conducting investigations of possible breaches of these laws was a source of vital and practical feedback.  His advice was that recent experience led him to conclude that company law could be enforced more effectively if a number of targeted legislative amendments were made.</P>
        <P>I will elaborate on each of the amendments proposed in the Bill shortly but, in summary, the Bill will improve enforcement of company law through a range of measures that will either clarify or amend existing law.  It includes provisions that clarify the right of the Office of the <Col N="270"/>Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, to access certain company and third party records; it provides for extensions to search warrants granted to the office; it introduces a mechanism, together with appropriate safeguards, for an extended power of seizure so that large volumes of paper or electronic information that may contain relevant material can be removed for later examination; it lightens the evidential burden on the Director of Corporate Enforcement when taking action against companies in default of existing provisions regarding loans to their directors; and it amends existing requirements relating to the disclosure of loans to directors in the annual accounts of licensed banks.</P>
        <P>With regard to the last provision, I must point out that while company law governs the disclosure of directors&rsquo; loans in the annual accounts and elsewhere, it does not extend to regulating bank lending and other banking activities.  This task falls to the Financial Regulator, which is also empowered under the Central Bank Acts to make rules to change conditions attaching to bank licences.  I understand the regulator is currently proposing to amend its rules on the disclosure of loans by banks to their directors and connected persons &mdash; areas that are at present covered by the Companies Acts.  My proposed changes to the Companies Acts take account of the rule-changing powers of the Financial Regulator but do not seek to duplicate its role in determining how best to oversee prudential supervision of the banks.</P>
        <P>To put just one of the measures contained in this Bill into a practical context &mdash; namely, the mechanism for determining legal professional privilege of records seized during an investigation &mdash; I will refer briefly to the ODCE&rsquo;s experiences during one recent large investigation.  This led to a court application, the outcome of which was covered by the media at the time.  The company in this case was Anglo Irish Bank, and the ODCE reports that this has been the largest and most complex investigation it has undertaken since it was set up in late 2001.  However, Deputies will appreciate that the issue that gave rise to this court case has general application and could be relevant to any large investigation.</P>
        <P>The issue in question arose from the fact that during the ODCE&rsquo;s investigation into Anglo Irish Bank on the bank&rsquo;s premises, large numbers of documents and computer records were seized by the Garda.  Before examining the seized material, the Garda must establish its legal professional privilege status.  With this objective, the parties agreed a mechanism for determining such privilege, and on 13 March last the ODCE sought High Court approval for this.  While the High Court judge stated that the mechanism proposed was &ldquo;eminently sensible&rdquo;, he did not believe that section 23 of the Companies Act 1990 as it stands gave the court statutory authority to outsource a function currently reserved to it.  The judge could not therefore approve the proposed mechanism.  As I will explain shortly, section 6 of the Bill will give legislative underpinning to an appropriate mechanism which is similar to the one proposed to the High Court.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to the provisions of the Bill and explain what each is designed to achieve.  Section 2 is a provision affecting the generality of companies and not simply the small number of companies that hold banking licences issued by the Irish Financial Regulator.  Subject to certain restrictions, existing company law allows a director legitimately to have a private interest in contracts or proposed contracts with his company.  However, he must declare any such interests to his fellow board members.  Failure to do so could make him liable for a fine and oblige him to account to the company for any profits he has gained.  The company is obliged to keep a record of directors&rsquo; declarations of interests in a book that is kept for this purpose.  The amendment being proposed in section 2 will give the Director of Corporate Enforcement a specific right of access to this book.  It will also provide a sanction in any case <Col N="271"/>in which a company fails to allow the director to access this information.  This will assist in enforcing compliance with the provisions of the Companies Acts.</P>
        <P>Sections 3 and 4 are linked and deal with the powers of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to require the production of records from a third party where these records relate to a company under investigation.  This power is vital to the director when he is investigating companies whose books are incomplete, for whatever reason.  The third party might typically be a director, auditor or employee of the company being investigated.  However, it may be the case that other individuals possess relevant documentation and, if so, this provision could be relevant to them.</P>
        <P>The right of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to access third party records has been already  provided through section 19(3) of the Companies Act 1990 and the director has informed me that he has already used it successfully in a number of cases.  However, he has requested that the provision be reworded to provide greater clarity and to avoid doubt in the future about what records can be sought from third parties.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Bill stipulates that the clarification being introduced here will not invalidate any previous requests for access to third party records.  This is important for the continuity of any ongoing investigations that rely on material discovered through the use of the existing powers.</P>
        <P>Section 5 is another provision with general application.  It deals with the entry and search of premises by the director or authorised officers of the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement on foot of a search warrant issued by a judge of the District Court.  At present, the Companies Act 1990 provides a limit of one month on the lifetime of such warrants.  While this will be sufficient in some investigations, it may not allow sufficient time to conduct large and complex searches or where substantial amounts of information are contained in electronic format.</P>
        <P>The amendments in the Bill provide for situations where an extension of the period of a search warrant can be sought from and granted by the court.  This will allow the court to take account of the grounds given for seeking an extension and to use its discretion in deciding whether to allow the extension.  This section of the Bill also makes provision for the removal of paper and electronic information from premises being searched, for subsequent examination elsewhere, to determine their relevance to the matters under investigation.  This is referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;extended power of seizure&rdquo;.  Appropriate detailed safeguards are also provided in the Bill to ensure this extended power is only used when appropriate.</P>
        <P>For example, the Bill stipulates the issues that should be taken into account by the director in deciding whether it is reasonably practicable to determine the relevance of something on the company&rsquo;s premises.  It also provides for the arrangements he or she must put in place before the extended power of seizure can be used.  These include the maintenance of confidentiality of seized information and granting the owner reasonable access to it.  The Bill also provides for arrangements to be adopted in cases where the director considers it necessary to avoid possible concealment, falsification, destruction or disposal of relevant material.</P>
        <P>The Bill as originally published required the director to deal as expeditiously as possible with the material seized and to return any material that proves not to be relevant to the owner as soon as possible.  No specific timeframes were included on the basis that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement fully intends to return any such records to their owners as quickly as possible.  Furthermore, the Bill already included ministerial regulation-making powers that could be used to impose timeframes at a later date if this were found to be necessary.</P><Col N="272"/>
        <P>However, having considered this matter further and also taking account of the debate in the Seanad, the T&aacute;naiste and I decided to strengthen the safeguards in this section by including prescribed timeframes within which determinations and separations of immaterial information must be made.  Our Seanad-approved amendment also introduces a mechanism where the parties can apply to court, before the expiry of the prescribed time limits, seeking a direction on various issues.  These are outlined in the new subsection 2G which is being inserted into section 20 of the Companies Act 1990 and provide maximum flexibility to the court in the directions it can give.</P>
        <P>For example, the direction might result in a lengthening or shortening of the time available to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to conduct its determination.  It might compel the office to alter the arrangements it has put in place on foot of its new powers of extended seizure and even require it to return seized material to its owner.  The court direction could also, if it deemed appropriate, provide that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement could retake possession of such returned material at a specified subsequent period.  The amendment also includes an ability for the court to hear matters other than in public.  This could be particularly important when the content of confidential company information is being discussed.  In drafting the Bill, every effort was made to provide for all situations that might arise during the course of an extended search.  However, should any new or unforeseen issue arise, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is being empowered to make appropriate regulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 6 makes several amendments to section 23 of the Companies Act 1990 which at present protects a person from having to disclose certain information under Part II of that Act.  The protected information in question is that which, in the opinion of the court, the person would be entitled to refuse to disclose on grounds of legal professional privilege.  While the 1990 Act allowed for a blanket prohibition on the seizure of such material, the Director of Corporate Enforcement reports there are sometimes difficulties in deciding during a search whether privilege pertains to specific documents.  The situation becomes even more problematic given the prevalence of electronic data storage.  A legal solution is necessary which recognises the inevitability of legal privileged data being mixed up with information not enjoying that privilege.</P>
        <P>The arrangement provided for in this Bill will permit the seizure of information, whether privileged or not, on a sealed basis.  It will then be a matter for the court to decide on matters relating to privilege.  Application to the court for such a ruling must be made by an officer of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or a court appointed inspector.  It may also be made by any person from whom disclosure is compelled or material taken.  The amendments also provide for the introduction of a mechanism where the court can be assisted by the appointment of an independent person with suitable legal qualification to examine the information and prepare a report with a view to assisting or facilitating the court in making its determination.  This amendment addresses the concerns expressed by the High Court during the hearing on 13 March 2009 to which I referred earlier.  To preserve confidentiality of sensitive information, the Bill provides that the court hearing can be held otherwise than in public.</P>
        <P>Section 7 relates to the important provisions contained in section 31 of the Companies Act 1990.  The section prohibits companies from making loans to their directors other than in certain defined circumstances.  This limitation on the personal use of a company&rsquo;s assets by directors and persons connected with those directors is to ensure the company has the available resources to pay its creditors as their debts fall due.  This prohibition is an important safeguard in company law and is applicable to all 180,000 companies incorporated in Ireland.  For this reason, breaches <Col N="273"/>of the provisions have been a particular focus of the work of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement since it was established in late 2001.</P>
        <P>Concerns were expressed that the success in prosecuting offending directors or companies might be affected by the current wording of section 40 of the Companies Act 1990, which puts an onus on the Director of Corporate Enforcement to prove a company director was aware that he or she was in default of the company law prohibition on loans to directors.  Section 7 of the Bill, therefore, substitutes section 40 of the Companies Act 1990, which sets out the penalty for breaches of section 31 of that Act.  The substituted provision will provide, in future, that if a company enters into a transaction or arrangement that contravenes section 31, every officer of the company who is in default will be guilty of an offence.  This aligns the offence with numerous similar offences under the Companies Act, and replaces the existing requirement for a successful prosecution to prove wilful default.  It also preserves a mechanism whereby an accused officer can defend his or her actions in appropriate circumstances.</P>
        <P>Section 8 amends sections 41 and 43 of the Companies Act 1990 and deals with the disclosure in the annual accounts of loans, that is, transactions, arrangements or agreements, made by a company to its directors and to persons connected with them.  To remove any doubt, the amendments include appropriate penalties for failure to disclose such loans and defences that can be made.  Section 8 also makes amendments that relate solely to companies that are licensed banks.  As section 9 also deals with this subject, I will address both sections together.</P>
        <P>In providing for a disclosure regime for company loans to their directors and to those connected with them, the Companies Act 1990 treated companies that are licensed banks differently from the generality of companies.  This different disclosure regime took account of the fact that lending is part of the day-to-day operations of a banking company and, unlike most other companies, the business of the banking sector was regulated and supervised.  While most companies must disclose in their annual accounts details of loans to their directors on an individual named basis, the accounts of companies licensed as banks require a lesser degree of disclosure.  Specifically, the banking company&rsquo;s accounts can disclose such data in aggregate format and only include information on amounts outstanding at the end of the financial year.  The banking company disclosure requirement is supplemented by a requirement to keep a register of relevant loans, details of which must be disclosed to shareholders in advance of the bank&rsquo;s annual general meeting.</P>
        <P>This Bill amends the disclosure requirements for banks in several ways.  In future, loans to directors of companies that are licensed banks will be treated in the same way as non-banking companies.  Specifically, all loans above a <i>de minimis</i> threshold to each individual named director must be disclosed separately in the annual accounts, as opposed to in aggregate format.  The maximum amount outstanding during the year will also be disclosed, not simply the amount outstanding at the end of the financial year.</P>
        <P>In so far as connected persons are concerned, the Bill provides for additional disclosure, but this is not as detailed as is required for directors.  It retains the existing aggregate disclosure of favourable loans in the case of connected persons, but provides that the maximum amount outstanding during the year must also be disclosed.  The Bill recognises that licensed banks may be required to make more detailed disclosures in their accounts under rules, directions or requirements imposed by the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>The Bill retains the requirement for a statutory register because of its value as a source of up-to-date data on current loans, but provides that information that will be required to be published in the accounts &mdash; as a result of the Bill or other requirement, such as the Financial Regulator&rsquo;s rules &mdash; need not also appear on the pre-AGM statement.  The Bill provides a <Col N="274"/>specific right of access for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to the statutory register of loans to directors and connected persons, so that he or she can take enforcement action if necessary.</P>
        <P>Section 10 amends sections 43 and 44 of the Companies (Amendment)(No.2) Act 1999 in order to meet the concerns of the European Commission that certain elements of the current provisions are not compatible with the EC Treaty.  A company law amendment introduced in 1999 sought to deal with Irish-registered companies that were controlled and managed from abroad and were treated as non-resident for tax purposes.  The 1999 Act required an Irish-registered company to have a director resident in the State or, alternatively, through a process involving the Revenue Commissioners and the Companies Registration Office, to show that it has a real and continuous link with economic activity being carried on in the State.  The amendment proposed in the Bill replaces the necessity to have at least one Irish resident-director with a requirement that one director must be resident in the European Economic Area.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to supporting the work of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in every possible way, including through the provision of appropriate statutory powers and resources to the office.  The Government&rsquo;s objective in proposing these legislative changes to the Oireachtas is twofold.  First, as we observed recent events unfold in the banking sector, the T&aacute;naiste and I were anxious to ensure the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has available to it an up-to-date suite of enforcement powers that are fit for purpose.  Second, we wish to ensure, from a business perspective, that our body of company law is relevant, transparent and proportionate both as regards the facilitation of the conduct of business in Ireland and as regards good governance and penalties.  Having a strong, transparent and proportionate legal framework is critical to our competitiveness and to our international reputation as a place in which to invest and conduct business.  I look forward to hearing Members&rsquo; views in what I hope will be a wide-ranging debate.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael will be supporting the Bill and will be happy to co-operate with its speedy passage through the House.  The Bill is relevant to certain investigations that are under way and it is important that the House should co-operate in the context of ensuring that those investigations are carried out to the fullest extent possible.  We will, however, be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage and I hope the T&aacute;naiste will look favourably on them.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a response to a series of corporate and banking scandals which have damaged both the economy and the reputation of the State.  I refer, for example, to the scandal involving loans to the directors of Anglo Irish Bank, the activities of Mr. Fingleton at the Irish Nationwide Building Society, the passage of moneys between Irish Life &amp; Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank and, previously, the overcharging and tax evasion engaged in by some of the larger banks.</P>
        <P>It might not have been necessary to introduce this Bill if such a lax approach had not been taken to financial regulation and if the Government had not been so soft on corporate crime.  If one consults the Official Report, it is interesting to note the number of occasions on which Members on this side &mdash; including the current Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Food, Deputy Trevor Sargent, who was then in opposition &mdash; raised the issue of the under-resourcing of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  The response of the then Taoiseach was that the Director of Corporate Enforcement would be obliged to wait his turn to obtain additional staff.  It is regrettable that such an attitude was adopted by the former Taoiseach and the Government.</P><Col N="275"/>
        <P>Another matter of interest is the delay in the introduction of the company law (consolidation) Bill, which has been promised for a long period.  We understand, from the output statement issued yesterday, that it is hoped to publish the Bill next year.  The T&aacute;naiste has abandoned her target of having it enacted in 2010.  I accept that this legislation is complicated and that, like the Taxes (Consolidation) Act, it will be a massive measure.  It is, therefore, important that we get it right.  However, I do not believe that we should accept the excuse put forward by the T&aacute;naiste that any amendments to the Bill before us should wait until the company law (consolidation) Bill is brought forward.  In light of her record, it is likely that the latter will not be enacted until 2011 or 2012.  My party will not accept being told that we must wait two years before important amendments are made.</P>
        <P>The Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 builds on the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.  As the Minister of State indicated, it deals with three broad issues, namely, improving the transparency of loans made by companies that are licensed banks to directors and persons connected to them, supporting the Director of Corporate Enforcement in his efforts to enforce compliance with company law &mdash; regardless of whether the company being investigated is a bank &mdash; and amending existing provisions relating to Irish-registered non-resident companies to meet European Commission concerns.  The latter relates to allowing company directors to be resident in EEA states and not just necessarily resident in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that companies which are licensed banks must in future disclose in their annual accounts prescribed details of all loans above a <i>de minimis</i> threshold made by their directors.  This disclosure will be on the same basis which already applies in respect of non-banking companies.  There will also be a disclosure regime for persons connected to those directors but this will not be as detailed as that which will apply in respect of the latter.  Essentially, we will continue to be presented with aggregate figures in respect of favourable loans given to connected persons.  The Bill also provides that the maximum amount outstanding during any given year will also have to be disclosed.</P>
        <P>I am not satisfied with section 41(6) of the Companies Act 1990, which deals with the matters to which I refer, and I intend to bring forward an amendment to it on Committee Stage.  Under the Bill as it stands, the loans that were taken out by Se&aacute;n Fitzpatrick would have to be disclosed.  However, preferential loans given to wives, girlfriends, husbands, boyfriends and other people connected to directors would not have to be disclosed.  All that will be provided is an aggregate figure in respect of all the loans given to connected persons.  As a result, we will not be in a position to know how many such loans were given, the identity of those to whom they were extended, the amounts involved or the level of repayments made.  The legislation represents an advance on the existing law.  However, it is unacceptable that we should allow the practices that occurred in the past to continue under the guise that they will relate to connected persons.  In light of its experience regarding personal finances being routed through the bank accounts of wives and girlfriends, the main party opposite should know better when it comes to an issue of this nature.</P>
        <P>The Bill also strengthens the enforcement of company law by making it an offence for companies, including banks and their directors, not to comply with the disclosure provisions in the Companies Act regarding loans, etc., to directors and connected persons and the material interest of such directors in company contracts.  It clarifies and provides a specific right of access for the ODCE to the statutory register of directors&rsquo; interests in contracts made to a company.  Furthermore, it modifies the evidential requirement of the ODCE when pursuing alleged breaches of company law rules in respect of company loans to directors.  In future, the ODCE will not, therefore, be obliged to prove willful default in order to secure a successful prosecution.  That is a major development.</P><Col N="276"/>
        <P>The Bill clarifies the right of the ODCE to access third party records in respect of companies under investigation.  It also modifies the provisions of the Companies Act 1990 relating to entry and search of premises by the ODCE.  In this regard, the Bill does not amend the provisions in the context of vehicles associated with a business.  Given that this matter has been an issue in cases involving the Competition Authority, is there not a case for considering such an amendment?</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for situations where the extension of the period of a search warrant can be sought from and granted by a court.  Furthermore, it makes provision for the removal of paper and electronic information, from premises being searched, for subsequent examination elsewhere in order to determine their veracity.</P>
        <P>I support these various amendments to the company law.  However, I am somewhat concerned with regard to the liability that will be imposed on directors in the context that they will be held collectively as well as severally responsible.  This provision is quite far-reaching and non-executive or worker directors might be prosecuted in respect of decisions to which they were not party.  However, the Bill makes provision for directors, should they be prosecuted, to enter a reasonable defence.  I will not be proposing specific amendments to the relevant section but I wish to place on record my concern that this matter might be the subject of a court case in the future.  Should a judge ever be obliged to hear such a case, it is important that the Oireachtas should state that it is not the intention to hold worker or non-executive directors liable for decisions to which they were not party.</P>
        <P>I will be tabling an amendment in respect of extending the remit of the ODCE to investigate mutual societies and credit unions.  I may be wrong but I understand the ODCE does not have the power to investigate mutual societies, such as Irish Nationwide, or credit unions in the way it has the power to investigate banks.  We are all concerned with regard to what has been happening in some credit unions and building societies.  In such circumstances, Fine Gael will not accept being told that we must wait for the enactment of the company law (consolidation) Bill before the power to which I refer is extended to the ODCE.</P>
        <P>By and large, we welcome the Bill, which represents progress and improves existing company law legislation.  However, we will be putting forward amendments in respect of the matters to which I refer.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will give them favourable consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation, the general thrust of which the Labour Party broadly supports.  As Deputy Varadkar and the Minister of State indicated, the Bill deals with three main issues relating to aspects of corporate governance and corporate law in general.  Everyone is aware of the events which necessitated its introduction.</P>
        <P>When enacted, the Bill will improve the transparency relating to loans made by companies that are licensed banks to directors and to persons connected to them.  That was an area which had a less vigorous application of corporate governance as against what applied to the 180,000 limited companies across the country.  It supports the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, in its efforts to enforce compliance with company law, regardless of whether the company being investigated is a bank.  The third point is that it amends some existing provisions relating to Irish-registered non-resident companies, to meet concerns expressed by the European Commission in this area, and in particular the view that the current companies code is not compatible with the EC treaty.</P>
        <P>The requirement that at least one director of a company must be resident in a state has been changed to require residence in a member state of the European Economic Area.  We are <Col N="277"/>acutely aware of the background as to why this Bill is necessary and why this aspect of company law must be modified and amended so that compliance with company law can be enforced more effectively, and to facilitate any possible breaches of company law being investigated more effectively, rigorously and efficiently.  There is no doubt that the Bill, when enacted, will greatly improve the overall enforcement of compliance with company law.  The ODCE will now have a statutory right to access certain company and third party records.  This permits applications for extensions to search warrants which have been obtained by the director&rsquo;s office.  The ODCE, as permitted under the legislation, will be able to seize large volumes of paper or electronic information that might contain significant relevant material for subsequent examination.   I am concerned that the appropriate safeguards should be put in place.</P>
        <P>We are all aware, from recent knowledge acquired, of the significant volume of records seized by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the ODCE&rsquo;s investigation of Anglo Irish Bank.  Notwithstanding broad agreement being arrived at by the relevant parties as to how it might be decided, on the question of legal and professional privilege, where this might arise in respect of seized material, the High Court judge, correctly in my view, decided that section 23 of the Companies Act 1990 did not permit the outsourcing of function &mdash; which is exclusively within the High Court&rsquo;s remit &mdash; to determine the question as to whether particular information is privileged legal material.  If a large volume of material is seized, how may it be determined what is relevant?  I appreciate there are separation measures and so forth, but there are issues there about which I am concerned.</P>
        <P>Will this be a widescale power to seize everything on sight and will there be no regulation?  There are issues as to how material may be separated in the legislation.  However, I always worry lest in our rush to give effect to a particular law that we go beyond what is required, and I have grave concerns in this area.  Legal professional privilege applies to communications emanating from legal advice and litigation and it protects the confidentiality of the relationship between a lawyer and his or her client.  This is a substantive right and such communications are important in the context of a fair trial, as specified under Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.  Thus, there are clearly public policy justifications for invoking same.  In effect, we have a balancing of all the interests concerned, but the Minister in this Bill, by way of section 6, has amended section 23 of the Companies Act 1990 and in effect, has elevated the principle of the public interest in these circumstances to have the material made available as outweighing expectations that confidentiality will be reserved.</P>
        <P>There is an important issue regarding intermixing of the information or data, some of which would attract legal privilege, while others which will clearly not.  An officer on the spot does not enjoy the luxury of making an instant evaluation of what is privileged or not, nor should he or she do so.  It now seems to be possible to seize all information, but only on what is termed a &ldquo;sealed basis&rdquo;.  What triggers this, however?  How will an officer on the ground be in a position to determine what material is relevant?  What triggers the point where he or she, on the spot, decides what particular information should be seized?  What will trigger the sealing of that information?  Those are all practical issues which may well lead to a judicial determination in due course, but there will have to be some subjective basis for doing this.  One cannot have somebody, willy-nilly, seizing all and sundry on a premises.  I do not believe that is the intention of the legislation and I should like more clarification on those aspects.</P>
        <P>Some information is in contemplation of legal proceedings.  Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Hanlon set out the issues involved in the Silverhill Duckling case.  The Smurfit Paribas case also set out the issues involved.  I should like to know somewhat more about this area and clarification should be forthcoming as to what allows an investigating officer to invoke this clause.  I must emphasise, as a barrister, that legal professional privilege is extremely important.  I know it can be set aside <Col N="278"/>if used to procure fraud or where criminal activity is involved, and rightly so.  However, it has an elevated status akin to sacerdotal privilege and I am concerned lest the baby be thrown out with the bathwater in this regard.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides for such intervention only on a &ldquo;sealed basis&rdquo;, where the contents remain confidential.  The Supreme Court, in the case of Smurfit Paribas <i>v.</i> A.A.B. Export Finance, 1990, on the question of whether a party to a litigation was entitled to claim privilege to refuse to produce particular evidence, ruled that this was a matter within the sole competence of the courts.  That is why the Minister has made this provision.  It is clearly for the courts to decide which is the superior interest in the circumstances of a particular case and to determine the matter of privilege and disclosure accordingly.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides that the application of the court for such a ruling must be made by an officer of the ODCE or a court appointed inspector, or by any person from whom the disclosure is compelled or the material is taken.  It is a two-way street, in effect, as regards the investigating officer or a court appointed inspector.  The court appointed inspector method has been quite widely used in relation to the bank cases, as referred to by Deputy Varadkar.</P>
        <P>Section 2 is applicable to companies in general and is related to the declaration of interests, such as an interest in contracts or proposed contracts with the company.  That is important and is a useful provision.  The company is obliged to keep a record of directors&rsquo; declarations of interests in a book kept specifically for this purpose.  The ODCE will now have a specific right of access to this book and a sanction will apply if such access is denied to the director.  That is a sensible provision.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Sections 3 and 4 enables the Director of Corporate Enforcement to require the production of records from a third party where those records relate to a company under investigation.  It appears that anybody who might appear to have details in his or her possession, such as records or documents,  whether a director or auditor, can be answerable in this regard.  How is that determined?  Has a further inquiry to be carried out in this regard?  This appears to reiterate what has already been provided in section 19(3) of the 1990 Act.  Section 4(2) is what may be termed the &ldquo;belt and braces&rdquo; provision, which retrospectively validates any acts done or steps taken in the course of an investigation that are already taking place or have been completed which sought access to third party records.  Basically, the legislation is ensuring that the investigations are already up and running.  I can see why there is need for such a belt and braces approach because it is clear that this would be open to a lawyer&rsquo;s inspection.  I can see where the Minister is coming from in that regard.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.2- ?>
       <P>Section 5 is what is commonly termed the &ldquo;entry and search&rdquo; provision.  It is of general application, while there may well be a specific purpose to be achieved.  It allows for an extension to be sought from the District Court in respect of the limit of one month which applies under the 1990 Act in respect of warrants.  The District Court is enabled to take account of the grounds given for seeking extension and to use its discretion in deciding whether to allow the extension as sought by the director.</P>
        <P>There is a reference to an extended power of seizure and I have some concerns on this section.  I am not in favour of the Minister being able to make regulations to deal with unanticipated situations which are not foreseen now.  I do not subscribe to this mechanism of making law and it should be used very sparingly, if at all.  A virtually untrammelled power of seizure, which is an infringement of confidence, particularly in respect of confidentiality of information and material, is being invoked.  I would be very careful.  I am approaching this from a barrister&rsquo;s perspective, because I read it carefully last night and I may well have misinterpreted it, but I have concerns.</P><Col N="279"/>
        <P Just="Left">I do not like the Minister having power.  He devolved to himself the power to make regulations to deal with those unanticipated situations.  Why would he make regulations?  I like to think we would debate it here in the Oireachtas.  If I have a wrong view or perception of what is involved, so be it.  At least we can thrash it out.  As Deputy Varadkar says, very often in statutory interpretation there are schematic reports, a teleological approach, a literal report and all sorts of approaches to interpretation of legislation.  However, a judge can very often resort to what is discussed here on Second Stage to help him or her divine the particular intentions of the Oireachtas when it enacts legislation.  I hold this dear and cherish it.  Every one of the 166 representatives here and the 60 in the Upper House should cherish this because we are the ultimate arbiters and makers of legislation.  I have always been against secondary legislation and the laying of things before the Oireachtas without discussion, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher probably knows this.  Any committee Chairman will know I always advocate and articulate that view so it is not new and is not due to this legislation.</P>
        <P>Section 8 amends sections 41 and 43 of the Companies Act 1990 and deals with the disclosure of companies&rsquo; annual accounts of loans and transactional arrangements made by a company to its directors and persons connected with them.  It includes penalty provisions for failure to disclose details of such loan arrangements and, quite rightly, provides for defences that can be made.  Deputy Varadkar made a point that I have in my notes, namely, what about the non-executive directors and worker directors in various companies.</P>
        <P>Thankfully we have worker directors now and many of them have made very significant impacts.  One of my colleagues, former councillor Mark Nugent, is vice-chairman of Bord na M&oacute;na and made an invaluable contribution in that area.  Those people who may not be associated with any particular decision, particularly worker directors who are elected by their work mates, will not be involved in those loans.  It appears to lay liability with everybody in relation to any decision that was taken.  How will the liability of non-executive directors or worker directors be determined?  They have a different role.  I concur with Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s view on this.</P>
        <P>The Companies Act 1990 treated companies that are licensed banks differently from other companies, as the Minister said in his speech, in so far as the banks were not compelled to make the same level of disclosures in their annual accounts.  From here on, future loans to directors of companies that are licensed banks will be treated in the same way as non-banking companies.  From here on, all loans above &euro;3,174.35, to each individual director will have to be disclosed in the annual accounts, as opposed to an aggregate format.  Is that equivalent to &pound;2,500?  Yes.  I had no time last night at 11 p.m. to calculate it.  I wish the Minister had put &pound;2,500 in brackets in the Bill.  The Minister might as well have set a figure of zero as &pound;2,500.  It would be a very foolish director who would get only &pound;2,400 because it would not be worthwhile making an application.  The maximum amount that is outstanding at any time in the financial year will have to be disclosed.</P>
        <P>There is a very good reason for that.  I heard several people, including the Minister of State and Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey, on a radio programme, who were perplexed at the amount that was outstanding at one time of the year and when the end of the year came, very little was outstanding.  This legislation will deal with that aspect and will avoid questions which leave a person mouth open, wondering and in awe.  That has been dealt with.</P>
        <P>The Director of Corporate Enforcement will have a right of access to the statutory register of loans made to directors and connected persons, and will be able to take appropriate enforcement action if it is not forthcoming.  Deputy Varadkar mentioned the definition of connected persons, such as wives and partners.  I am not as caught up about that as him.  I was on the finance committee when it dealt with all the great legislation in the Ethics in Public Office Bill. <Col N="280"/> Former Deputy Ger Connolly was a very wise man.  One should always listen to wisdom, especially when one is young, not necessarily in years but in terms of having been recently elected.</P>
        <P>How far does this stretch?  We stand for elections.  Our wives, partners, daughters, sons, uncles or mothers do not stand.  They would all be classified as connected persons, and the Minister would accept that.  I understand what Deputy Varadkar is saying, that a loan could be taken in the name of Anne Penrose, rather than Willie Penrose.  It would not be so handy because other legislation governs it now, but I can see why the connected person is not as widely defined in this legislation as Deputy Varadkar referred to.  I understand the reasoning behind it.  We must all treat people as individuals.  Loans to people will appear in accounts and will be registered on the register of loans.</P>
        <P>While I accept what Deputy Varadkar is saying and I know where he is coming from, I remember that legislation where there was an invasion of everybody&rsquo;s rights on the basis that they were connected persons.  There is no end to it.  It could extend to my cousin or second cousin.  How far does one stretch to this connected person?  I have a view on this.  I ran for election and it is fine if somebody takes a picture of me, but I have a concern about people taking a picture of my wife, children or anybody else who did not stand for election or have anything to do with it.</P>
        <P>Section 10 amends sections 43 and 44 of the Companies (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 1999 to ensure compatibility of a company law provision with the EC treaty.  The 1999 Act required a company that wished to register in Ireland to have a direct resident in the State or show it had a real and continuous link with economic activity that was being carried on in the State.  This section will provide that one director of such a company must be resident in the European Economic Area.  As I said at the outset, the Labour Party broadly welcomes the thrust of the Bill but there are issues, which I have set out here, that give one food for thought.  Some of the provisions in the legislation, when enacted, must be used sparingly and as a matter of last resort, especially the extended power of seizure.</P>
        <P>I would like the Office of Corporate Enforcement to lay a report before the Oireachtas annually setting out how often the Director of Corporate Enforcement has to resort to the use of certain provisions of this Bill as part of the investigative work, especially the use of sections 5 and 6 of this legislation.  That would be useful information for Members and the wider interest in this.  I look forward to facilitating this.  Next Thursday we have Committee Stage.  The Minister is obviously very eager to progress this Bill and we will not obstruct it.  I made my points in a constructive fashion with no view to inhibit the Bill in any way.  I know Mr. Paul Appleby and his staff very well.  They are working very hard and carrying out excellent work on behalf of the country.  Corporate governance is very important to our competitiveness and making Ireland attractive internationally as a place to do business.</P>
        <P>In the next 12 to 18 months, I look forward to facilitating the company law consolidation and reform Bill.  Deputy Varadkar is correct that it will take time given that it will contain almost 1,300 provisions.  The sooner it becomes law, the better.  It will be important for the public who will use it, and certainly for company directors and entrepreneurs.  I appreciate that it is a mammoth task.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State might need to get additional external help to achieve the time target.  We will certainly help in that regard.  If we need to establish a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we would facilitate that in order to <Col N="281"/>ensure that the legislation can appear on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.  We look forward to playing a constructive role in ensuring this legislation is passed as quickly as possible.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Cyprian Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to register my support for the Bill.  At a time when public confidence in various different arms of the State and particularly in regulatory authorities is at an all-time low, it is imperative to take strong action to try to restore that confidence and restore people&rsquo;s faith in the bodies that, in effect, mind their money.  They need to be sure that if for any reason an individual or group with responsibility for administering funds on behalf of people does not fulfil that responsibility or jeopardises the trust and faith people put in it, there are strong enforceable deterrents and penalties.  This Bill arises from the context in which the country finds itself at present.</P>
        <P>In recent years all banks have changed the way in which they do their business.  Through the use of Internet and telephone banking, banks have endeavoured to remove the customer from face-to-face contact with people working in the branches.  They have made it harder for people to do their business on a face-to-face basis.  The way some banks have done their business is open to abuse despite several years of strengthening and modernising the regulatory framework here.  I welcome that this Bill goes a long way towards dealing with some of the issues in our system.</P>
        <P>In my experience in this House, we have always endeavoured to keep pace particularly with the requirements arising from EU directives.  We have always adhered to and used best international practice.  We have also tried to deal with the ever-changing and fast-changing technology in the financial area.  It has been obvious to many people that the frameworks that have been put in place over time have become more complicated and stronger.  In some way what has happened internationally and domestically in the past eight to 12 months is unprecedented.  We now find ourselves in a position where we need to adjust our regulatory framework and laws to take account of what has happened and this legislation is a good example in that regard.</P>
        <P>As my learned friend, the previous speaker, a practitioner in the area of law, will be aware, company and corporate law is a very technical complicated and intricate branch of our legal system.  As he also mentioned, it is greatly open to interpretation.  This legislation is an example of putting down a clear concise line, which is not subject to any great interpretation, but will ensure that it is fit for purpose and does what it is supposed to do.  Laws exist primarily to <Col N="282"/>protect citizens.  Company and corporate laws exist to protect citizens doing business here.  They exist to remove the risk of falling foul of unscrupulous traders who trade outside the law.  They exist to protect those people who want to stay within the law and just want to get on with their business.</P>
        <P>The Bill goes a long way towards closing some of the loopholes which have obviously developed over time, particularly in corporate law.  It empowers the Director of Corporate Enforcement to take the appropriate actions to prevent such abuses of the law.  The fact that it is being introduced with agreement from all sides of the House is a clear indication that it is needed, welcomed and will work into the future.  As I said at the outset, at a time when the public confidence in how we do our business and protect people doing business as well as ordinary savers mortgage holders is at an all-time low, it is imperative that the Government and the House ensure that we do everything possible to restore confidence in the system we have.</P>
        <P>I was very interested to hear the former Prime Minister of Iceland speaking on the radio this morning.  He said that his country had attempted to keep up with changes in international law, corporate law and regulatory law.  Ireland is an example of a small peripheral country on the edge of Europe but none the less playing a major part in Europe.  We have that added protection here.  We have always complied with our requirements under EU legislation and will continue to do so.  In this area of the law, it is imperative that we take firm concise clear action.  When we come across a problem, the laws need to make it clear to everybody what will happen.  It is a point Deputy Penrose, who is Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, made previously.  We need to ensure that the thrust of the legislation is to protect those who are most vulnerable and not senior management or the guys at the top.  We need to protect the people who are entrusting their money, whether that be their life savings, deposits or mortgages, to others to administer on their behalf.  I very much welcome the legislation and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As the previous speaker said, how we are perceived is important.  We need to ensure that Ireland is perceived as a safe place to do business.  That was not the case.  This Bill will help in many ways to repair the recent damage done to the reputation of the financial sector.  Its main purpose is to ensure that directors&rsquo; financial dealings will be fully represented on companies&rsquo; balance sheets which has to be good.</P>
        <P>It also provides welcome additional powers for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to access information held by companies or third parties that may be relevant to an investigation of corporate malpractice.  In addition to these measures, it increases the penalties for company officers whose companies provide loans to directors in prohibited circumstances and gives greater search powers to the authorities in cases of suspected corporate malpractice.</P>
        <P>The Bill follows the recent controversy in which directors of financial institutions received large loans, yet did not have to disclose them to shareholders in the company accounts.  We were all shocked, disappointed and angry at the disclosures last December that the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank had, over eight years to 2007, temporarily transferred loans from Anglo Irish Bank to the Irish Nationwide Building Society prior to the group&rsquo;s year end.  These loans amounted to over &euro;87 million and the bank&rsquo;s shareholders were not aware of them.  Total loans to directors at that institution were in the region of &euro;179 million and while this may not have been illegal at the time it was, in the words of the former chairman, &ldquo;inappropriate and unacceptable from a transparency point of view&rdquo;.  That is putting it mildly because the damage <Col N="283"/>that it has done and the anger it has created have undermined the economic and political foundations of the State.  That cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.  People must be dealt with in the most severe manner.</P>
        <P>Investigations into some of these matters are going on and I have every confidence that the right course of action will follow from them.  The public is angry about what went on in many of these institutions and that is as it should be.  I do not wish to pre-empt any of these investigations but anyone who is found to have abused his or her position must be held accountable.  In order to rebuild confidence in the economic and political foundations of the State, people must be held accountable.  I cannot emphasise that point strongly enough.</P>
        <P>Questions remain too about the behaviour of the former Financial Regulator who allowed these practices to happen.  I cannot fathom why he did nothing to prevent them.  It is hard to understand what was going through his mind at the time.  To some extent we all live in bubbles, but he must have been living on a different planet.  People who hold positions of authority, such as chairmen and chief executives, have a responsibility to behave openly and honestly to serve best the interests of the people they have been appointed to serve.  Unfortunately, as the lessons of recent months have shown, people cannot always be trusted not to abuse the faith placed in them.  There are people in every walk of life who betray the trust placed in them.  We must put in place legislation and systems to ensure that people comply with regulations and standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While it is regrettable that those measures were not introduced previously, this Bill will ensure that the stakeholders will be protected from the practices that became known last year.  It sends out the message loud and clear that Ireland is deeply committed to holding companies and their directors to account.  It ensures that disclosure in company accounts of loans to directors of companies that are licensed banks will be treated in the same way as those in non-banking companies.  All loans above the minimum threshold to each individual named director must be disclosed separately in the annual accounts as opposed to an aggregate format.  The maximum sum outstanding during the year will be disclosed, not simply the sum outstanding at the end of the financial year.  It will also be an offence for companies, including banks, and their directors, not to comply with the disclosure provisions in the Companies Acts regarding loans to directors and connected persons and regarding the material interests of directors in company contracts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also warmly welcome the increased powers afforded to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, including the greater powers to enter premises and seize documents.  In respect of the operations of Anglo Irish Bank, I am concerned that action must be taken as soon as the alarm bells ring.  The enforcement officers must act straight away.  There should be no time lag.  There is concern that there was a gap between the ringing of the alarm bells and the entry into the property.  The power to seize documents will enhance and assist in the investigation of malpractice.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister and her staff on their work on this Bill which will go a long way to restoring Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and reassure people not just here, but internationally that Ireland is a safe and trustworthy place to do business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Leo Varadkar, Willie Penrose, Cyprian Brady and Chris Andrews for their contributions to this Bill.  </P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar need not have sleepless nights over the weekend about the staffing of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, because eight additional staff were <Col N="284"/>appointed in 2007-8 and six more last March.  I hope this will help the Director of Corporate Enforcement in his investigations and ongoing monitoring.</P>
        <P>Deputies raised interesting points.  I believe that the primary role of this Assembly is to legislate and the decisions and opinions of Deputies on all sides should be taken into account in bringing forward legislation to ensure that when it goes onto the Statute Book it has the broad support of the Oireachtas.  We tried to do that in the Seanad and accommodate as much as we could, but we have to accept legal advice from the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>We can have a broader debate on the Bill next Thursday.  I thank Deputy Penrose, Chairman of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment for agreeing to take Committee Stage of the Bill next week.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s point that the ODCE should monitor the activities of the building societies and credit unions, we have examined this several times and are of the view, as are most of our advisers, that those sectors should fall under the remit of the Financial Regulator.  We can give the Deputy broader reasons for that on Committee Stage.  The issue has been raised a couple of times but that is my opinion, that of the Minister, the Department and others from whom we have sought advice on this issue.</P>
        <P>Deputy Leo Varadkar also expressed concern about the offence provisions in this Bill fearing that well-intentioned and responsible directors or officers of a company could be held liable for the acts of less scrupulous or non-compliant colleagues.  One of the offences mentioned in the Bill, under section 7, is that officers will be held to be guilty of an offence if the company contravenes the existing statutory provisions restricting a company&rsquo;s ability to give loans to its directors.  This offence is being expressed in accordance with comparable provisions elsewhere in the Companies Acts.</P>
        <P>Section 383 of the Companies Act 1963 already provides a defence for officers in default.  Specifically, this provides that an officer shall be presumed to have permitted a default by his or her company unless the officer can establish that he or she took all reasonable steps to prevent the occurrence of the event in question, or that by reason or circumstances beyond his or her control, was unable to do so.  This defence will also apply to any offence under section 7 of this Bill.</P>
        <P>The other offences in this Bill are in section 8.  They provide that a director of a company shall be guilty of an offence if he or she fails to comply with the disclosure provisions about loans, directors and connected persons.  In each of the two offences, specific defences are provided in the following subsections.  In all three offences, the fact that the officer or director took all reasonable steps to ensure compliance with his or her obligations will be a key determinant in informing the court&rsquo;s attitude in any cases brought before it.</P>
        <P>Deputy Penrose spoke about appropriate safeguards.  Amendments to section 20 and 23 of the 1990 Act, outlined in section 5 of this Bill, contain the appropriate balances and mechanisms identifying the appropriate material spelled out in the existing section 19 of the Companies Act 1990.  I could go through that in detail, but I might defer it to Committee Stage.  People opposite me have much more experience debating the law, but it is important to refer back to the other Companies Acts.  Most of the major changes and provisions are still in the Companies Act 1990.  We should not look at this Bill in isolation.  We will be more than willing to provide information to Deputies on the Acts before Committee Stage.  I urge anybody who wishes to table amendments on Committee Stage to have a glance at <i>The Companies Acts 1963-2006</i>, which is edited by Lyndon McCann and Thomas B. Courtney.  It is great reading.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 5(2J) on regulation making powers will only be used on supplementation and consequential and incidental matters.  Deputy Penrose raised this issue.  It states that the Minister shall make regulations providing for supplementary, consequential and incidental matters, or in respect of subsections 2A or 2F as he considers necessary or expedient.  If there is to be any major changes, it would have to be done in primary legislation as well.  We can go through that in further detail on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>While interesting comparisons have been made between the company law definition of a connected person and that used in ethics in public office legislation, I am satisfied that the current definition in company law that applies to all companies is appropriate.  The relevant provision defines a connected person as the director&rsquo;s spouse, parents, brothers, sisters or children, a person acting in his capacity as a trustee of any trust, the principal beneficiaries of which are the director, his spouse or any of his children, or any body corporate which he controls, or in partnership with that director under the meaning of section 1(1) of the Partnership Act 1890.  There is a full detail on the definition of connected persons.</P>
        <P>Deputy Penrose made an interesting suggestion that the ODCE include information on the use of the extended power of seizure  it in the annual report.  We will have a look at this and we will get back to the Deputy on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Deputy Brady spoke about the financial regulatory matters that fall within the remit of the Minister for Finance.  Many Deputies probably used this opportunity to raise the broader issues of corporate governance and confidence in the governance of our financial institutions.  This is in an integral part of our economy.  The financial services industry alone employs about 25,000 people in the IFSC, and then we have the broader lending and banking institutions.  It is very important that there is confidence in corporate governance in those sectors.  It is of critical national interest to make sure that there is confidence in governance, because that feeds into the markets and our ability to sell financial services abroad and to encourage companies to locate in Ireland.  Equally, it is important to state that we are one of the best countries in the world in the context of corporate governance.</P>
        <P>While some Deputies outlined some difficulties, I would not like to comment on them because investigations are ongoing and I would not want to jeopardise anything in that area.  The general idea that Ireland has a strong body of legislation to ensure good corporate governance is there.  I believe there is a genuinely positive ethic in corporate governance across Ireland.  The Minister for Finance will be bringing forward proposals for financial regulation.  We will also be bringing forward the companies (consolidation) Bill in the new year.  If we are around for that, it will take up a lot of the committee&rsquo;s time.</P>
        <P>When we are dealing with these broad issues, it is important that there is a consensus across the House.  Deputy Penrose referred to an interesting issue.  There was a time when all Second Stage speeches in this House were sent down to the courts so that the judges and the barristers could read and interpret the intention of the House, as opposed to the literal interpretation of legislation.  I am not sure if that still happens, but I was once critical of certain aspects of the interpretation of mandatory sentencing of ten years for people convicted of drug dealing.  The interpretation elsewhere was not what was intended in this House.  I am glad to see that there has been a change to that view.  We now have a situation where mandatory sentencing is becoming the norm for people convicted of very serious drug offences.  That is another issue, but it is important that the intention of the legislation as passed in this House is taken into account when people are adjudicating, obviously respecting the independence of everybody else named in the Constitution.</P><Col N="286"/>
        <P>We will have a broad ranging discussion about the Bill on Committee Stage.  We must make sure that the Bill is very focused.  It is primarily a technical Bill, and the broader issue of company legislation will be dealt with in the companies (consolidation) Bill.  Hopefully the Bill will have a speedy passage through Committee Stage, even though we do not want to rush it either.  If I can accommodate people in any way possible, I will try to do that.  I thank the officials in my Department for their hours of work on this particular issue, and everybody else involved in the House.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have met representatives of RTE on several occasions in the past 12 months.  We have discussed a wide range of issues, including the current economic climate and the impact it is having on RTE&rsquo;s funding difficulties.  RTE, as a dual-funded broadcaster, is heavily dependent on commercial revenue, of which advertising revenue is the primary component.  RTE, like many other commercial organisations, has been subject to a significant decline in its commercial income in <Col N="287"/>the latter half of 2008 and throughout 2009.  I understand from RTE that following a satisfactory start to 2008, its commercial revenue fell sharply in the second half of that year.  RTE&rsquo;s commercial income amounted to &euro;239.9 million in 2008, compared to &euro;245.5 million in 2007, representing a decline of 2.25% for 2008.  It was clear early in 2009 that RTE&rsquo;s shortfall in commercial income was continuing at a rapid pace as the adverse domestic and international climate took a firmer hold.  RTE is not alone in facing such problems.  Along with officials from my Department, I meet the various interests that comprise the broadcasting sector from time to time.  All commercial, independent and public service broadcasters face difficult and challenging times.  They will need to manage their day-to-day operations as carefully and prudently as possible.  RTE has put in place a package of cost-saving and efficiency measures.  It is taking steps to address the significant shortfall in its commercial revenue.  While the nature of these measures is an operational matter for RTE, I am satisfied that RTE is endeavouring to deal with its financial problems in the most prudent manner possible.  I will continue to liaise with the RTE Authority and RTE management on an ongoing basis on issues, including the financial situation in the organisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  In 2007, did the Minister receive the Indecon report on costings within RTE that was referred to in last weekend&rsquo;s newspapers?  What actions did he take, or insist that RTE take, as a result of the recommendations in that report?  I understand the Indecon report indicated that Ireland&rsquo;s national broadcaster had higher <i>per capita</i> staffing costs than the BBC, and that the gap was growing.  It suggested that the station needed to develop a corporate commitment to cost savings.  It criticised RTE&rsquo;s failure to undertake any formal benchmarking exercise over recent years, whether by comparison with public service broadcasters outside Ireland or commercial broadcasters in Ireland and elsewhere.  It pointed out the obvious fact that 50% of RTE&rsquo;s costs can be attributed to staffing costs.  It said that while other public service broadcasters, like the BBC, were successfully introducing ambitious systems to reduce staffing costs, the opposite was happening in RTE.  A series of warning signs should have been noted by RTE and the Minister before the downturn and the subsequent collapse in RTE&rsquo;s advertising revenues.  Did the Minister act on the recommendations in the Indecon report?  He said he has had a number of conversations with Cathal Goan and others in RTE.  Were those conversations influenced by the independent report I have mentioned? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I received the report in November 2007.  I acted on it by sanctioning a television licence fee increase.  The report mentioned that a five-year plan, including measures of performance, was set out after RTE&rsquo;s licence fee revenue increased significantly in 2002.  The station had to reach certain hours of programming, for example.  The report stated that although the plan had been successful in increasing the production of home-produced output, for example, RTE needed to go further.</P>
        <P>We needed a metric of performance in RTE that first measured the quality of content not only simply in hours of output but in detailed metric analysis as to how it met its public service obligations.  Second, we had to measure the efficiency or the effectiveness with which RTE delivered such programming on the basis of the measures the Deputy mentioned, namely, performance compared to other countries in terms of RTE&rsquo;s flexibility, efficiency and cost efficiency.  We wanted a new measurement system in RTE on quality and effective flexibility to achieve savings within the operation.  To achieve that we appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers in March 2008 to work with RTE to examine how we would develop that new metric of performance and efficiency within the organisation.  That work was ongoing and is now completed.  We are now assessing the 2007 and 2008 accounts on the basis of the original five year measure<Col N="288"/>ment system, but from 2009 onwards we will apply this new assessment method to establish how efficiently RTE is working and what is the quality of its programming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister happy that just fewer than 150 people in RTE earn more than &euro;100,000 a year?  Seven or eight people in the organisation earn more than &euro;300,000 per annum.  Is that appropriate for an organisation the size of RTE?  Perhaps it is, I do not know, but it is my job to ask those questions when RTE is currently under significant pressure financially and that pressure is being added to by the increased responsibilities in the organisation that will arise from the Broadcasting Bill and in particular from the DTT service.</P>
        <P>I would like to recognise the vote among unions in RTE to introduce wage reductions, which involve significant sacrifices for many staff members.  That was not an easy decision and it is important to recognise that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also recognise that decision by RTE unions, which was not an easy one to take to provide savings.  In that consideration process, the rate of pay across the organisation was a central issue, but I am not going to intervene and micro-manage its payment structures.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Even with the efficiencies that we have introduced and the new ways of measuring that, it is clear that RTE in the current downturn, like all other broadcasting companies, will have to make difficult choices to make savings to make up for the loss of commercial revenue.  They will have to be in pay costs and other non-personal operation costs, which is happening.  It already made significant savings early this year.  Decisions will have to be made on other one-off items to achieve savings.  That is not an easy task, but at least it is starting off on the right foot in that both unions and management have agreed the broad principles in terms of the pay related issues.</P>

        <Quest> the protection there is for consumers from scams in regard to premium rate services, particularly subscription services targeting children in view of his failure to publish legislation and of the failure of Regtel to act effectively; when the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2009 will be published; the way it will ensure proper regulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In accordance with its current remit, Regtel is independent in its functions and oversight is exercised by the Regtel board.  At present, premium rate services are regulated in accordance with contractual arrangements between Regtel and the service providers and by means of a code of practice to which all service providers are obliged to adhere.  In addition, Regtel provides advice to consumers and recently launched a major education and awareness campaign, the STOP campaign, to alert consumers to the negative aspects of subscription services and how to unsubscribe from these services in an easy manner.  Information on Regtel&rsquo;s code of practice, including the sanctions available for non-compliance and their awareness and advice campaigns, can be viewed on their website at <i>www.regtel.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>According to Regtel, the majority of premium rate service providers operate within its code of practice.  There are, however, a small number of non-compliant providers in the sector whose activities have brought the sector into disrepute and who have undermined public confidence in the regulation of the sector.  It is the activities of these operators that must be the target of stricter regulation and enforcement.</P><Col N="289"/>
        <P>I have prepared a draft Bill for the purpose of transferring the regulation of premium rate services to ComReg and to provide the necessary enforcement measures for the more effective regulation of the sector in the interest of consumer protection. The draft Bill has been recently circulated to all Departments for their observations.  I expect to submit the draft Bill to Government for approval, to publish it shortly and to have it enacted as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
        <P>The actions I have taken have been aimed at ensuring a robust and timely response to those service providers who continue to flout the rules and mislead consumers.  The transfer of the regulatory function to the ComReg and the strengthening of the regulatory regime has been the subject of extensive consultation between my Department, ComReg and Regtel and with the industry.  Many issues had to be considered and teased out to ensure the necessary tools and resources are available to ComReg to effectively regulate this sector and to protect users of these services.  I believe the Bill, which is due to be published in this session, will achieve that objective.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He must be aware this issue is a problem.  It may involve only a small number of operators who are carrying out what are essentially scams but thousands of people are affected by them.  Will the Minister accept that he needs to ensure the proposed Bill will be of the best standard in terms of regulation if it is to work, given that Regtel has been operating for some time and yet problems still persist.  </P>
        <P>Will the Minister publish the draft Bill before it is introduced in the House?  I urge him to ensure there is some form of public consultation on this issue.  Will he advise what protection there is in the Bill for the consumer?  I understand there is provision in the Bill for the levying of fines on operators but that the current procedure where consumers are refunded money they are owed is not included.   I urge the Minister to note that this is about consumers primarily and that many people have suffered considerable losses, some small amounts and others large amounts.  Is he aware, for example, that the last annual report of Regtel indicated a payment of &euro;179,000 was made to consumers in regard to an operator?  Can he guarantee that in the Bill he will provide for a facility to refund customers who have a genuine complaint, as the people concerned are essentially being ripped off by unscrupulous operators?</P>

	<P>I agree with the Deputy that this is a serious issue.  What drew my attention to it and to amending the law on this issue was the volume of complaints received.  In 2007 to 2008 some 21,000 people sought to unsubscribe to services and more than 6,000 direct consumer complaints were made.  If one receives that level of public complaint, there is a serious problem concerning an issue.  Part of the problem is that there is not sufficient legal protection or legal enforcement and that is what will be addressed in the Bill.  It is on the A list of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme and is to be published this session.  I still expect we will be able to do that subject to Cabinet approval.  That allows us the summer for any other bodies to consider it before it will be introduced in the D&aacute;il to be enacted.  </P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P Just="Left">The Deputy is right in what she said.  I will not go into the details of the Bill before it is published.  We are seeking to ensure there is provision in the Bill for the imposition of significant fines, real powers and, crucially, codes of conduct for operators to ensure the refunds the Deputy mentioned are effectively delivered.  This is important legislation covering an issue that annoys many people.  Such practices involve a financial loss for them that is often daylight robbery.  We have to stop that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I want clarification on this matter.  The Minister mentioned fines which would be levied on the operator.  What I am talking about is refunding the consumer for his or her loss.  Is the Minister saying there is provision in the Bill specifically for consumers to receive <Col N="290"/>refunds?  It is not satisfactory to expect people to go to court to achieve their rights.  Refunds are currently being paid back to consumer by way of Regtel.  Is that specific provision included in the Bill?  If it is not, and if the Minister does not want to publish the Bill before it has done the rounds, will he ensure that provision is included in the Bill? </P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>A recent High Court challenge by Realm, a company with a non-compliant reputation, to a Regtel adjudication against the company resulted in an out-of-court settlement in which the company agreed to comply with Regtel&rsquo;s code of practice to refund consumers and to reimburse Regtel for expenses.  It is our intention within the Bill to have the facility for customers to be refunded, but we need to get the Bill approved by Cabinet first before we go into the detail.   </P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2006 the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, ended the regulation of tariffs for large energy users.  Some 90% of large energy users have now switched to independent suppliers.  The CER has signalled that it intends to cease regulating ESB public electricity supply prices when sufficient competition has taken hold in the domestic and small and medium enterprise market.  This is in line with EU legal requirements for the internal energy market.</P>
        <P>In recent months domestic customers have been switching to independent suppliers in unprecedented numbers, thereby availing of the significant discounts available from these suppliers.  However, it is important to note that there are close to 2 million domestic electricity customers and that the ESB still retains approximately 90% of the market share.  The ESB also retains a market share of approximately 43% of the SME market.  I am advised that discounts of between 10% and 20% are available to SMEs from competing suppliers and I strongly encourage small businesses to shop around in the interest of obtaining competitive quotations.</P>
        <P>Energy price regulation is designed to ensure that a dominant player does not engage in uncompetitive short-term pricing practices which could undermine or drive out emerging competition.  Regulation should cease once competition has taken firm hold in the domestic market.  The ESB&rsquo;s tariffs are set by the CER at a level that reflects the costs borne by the ESB in supplying that electricity.  Effectively, that means that if it can lower its legitimate costs the regulator will permit it to charge a lower tariff.  What is not permitted under the regulatory model is below-cost selling of electricity or other anti-competitive practices.</P>
        <P>The CER has also exited from the regulation of gas tariffs for large users.  In that sector around 88% of business, in volume terms, has switched to independent gas suppliers.  The gas market has been fully opened up to competition since July 2007.  Experience in other markets has shown that there is a time lag between full market opening and the emergence of viable competition.  The potential for ending tariff regulation in the domestic gas market is limited by the size of the Irish market, which is very small by international standards.  Of the companies <Col N="291"/>that supply gas in Ireland, Bord G&aacute;is Energy has approximately 600,000 residential customers, while Flogas has approximately 9,000.  Neither Vayu nor Energia currently supplies residential customers.</P>

        <P el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P el="0">Bord G&aacute;is Energy also has a dominant market share in the small commercial users&rsquo; market segment and tariffs in this sector are also regulated by the CER.</P>
        <P>The nature of regulation is to drive improved efficiencies and lower costs in areas that are under regulatory control.  This is designed to benefit customers primarily.  The CER will continue to review overall energy tariff structures in the coming months, taking account of global fuel prices, the importance of regulatory and market certainty for the energy sector, and the competitiveness challenges facing industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had this debate before, and I will continue to make the same point, particularly with regard to the electricity market; I accept that the gas market is slightly different.  We have a crazy situation in which the ESB could supply households in Ireland with electricity for at least 10% less than the cost of producing it at the moment.  Yet it is not allowed to do so because of regulation, in an attempt, as the Minister has clearly outlined, to promote competition and to allow competitors of the ESB in the household market to gain a foothold.  In other words, we are waiting for Bord G&aacute;is Energy and Airtricity, which are the two main competitors for the ESB, to get more customers before we will allow the ESB to reduce its prices.</P>
        <P>One can consider this from the perspective of the ESB, in which it is not allowed to compete to keep its customers, but more importantly, one can consider it from the perspective of the 2 million households which are paying 10% more for electricity than they should be.  If BGE and Airtricity can produce electricity and sell it at a price that is not considered to be anti-competitive or below-cost selling but the main supplier of electricity cannot, we are essentially overcharging households that use the main supplier.  That accusation is backed up by all the evidence which suggests that when one compares Ireland to other countries across the EU, Irish households are paying too much for electricity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must ask a question. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>At what point in the electricity market will the Minister insist on opening up the household market to competition so the ESB can compete?  How many customers do BGE and Airtricity have to take from the ESB before the Minister will allow an opening of the market so everyone can benefit? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a competitive market in electricity for many users &mdash; the big users, the business customers&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about households.  That is what the question was about and I ask the Minister to stick to that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>These users have at least four large international suppliers competing fiercely for their business. </P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What about households?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Such competition is the best way to bring down prices. The way we do that is through proper regulation and that is what we are doing, similarly, in the residential sector. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Anyone seeking a 10% or 13% reduction in his or her electricity bill can make a phone call today and switch supplier, which brings down the price.  This is a highly competitive situation which has been delivered by the regulated market.  That regulatory market works.  It is bringing about the price reductions that anyone can see are available. </P>

	<P>What about the other 1.8 million who are being overcharged? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is nothing stopping any one of them from making a transfer in the morning without the slightest difficulty.  It only takes a single phone call.  We have a successful, competitive market that is delivering lower prices because we are forcing competition through.  That is what works.  Once we start moving away from that we are doing customers a disservice because we are going back to a protected monopoly in which the main suppliers crowd out everyone else and keep prices high in the medium to long term.  That is not in the customer&rsquo;s interest or the country&rsquo;s interest.  What we are doing is working.  I do not think the Deputy opposite has an alternative that would not destroy the competitive process. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is talking nonsense.  He claims that competition works, yet he is preventing the largest supplier in the market from competing.  We have a controlled market in terms of price.  It is true that people can pick up the phone and switch to Bord G&aacute;is as long as they can be sure their bank account details are safe&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Or Airtricity. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to that.  They can also switch to Airtricity.  I encourage people to switch.  Both Bord G&aacute;is and Airtricity are fine companies that can provide reliable electricity.  However, this idea that by allowing the ESB to reduce its prices we will drive Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is out of the market is utter nonsense.  These are large, powerful companies with big backers, particularly in the case of Airtricity.  Bord G&aacute;is is currently building power stations in order to supply electricity at more competitive prices than the ESB.  It is committed to that expenditure.  It will not be driven out of the marketplace by the ESB; it is fanciful to suggest that.  At present, whether the Minister likes it or not, 1.8 million of the 2 million households in Ireland are paying 10% more for electricity than they should be because the ESB is not allowed to reduce its prices. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Bord G&aacute;is will not leave the market when the ESB reduces its prices.  That is what happens when the proper regulatory system is applied. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Minister delaying it? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulator will assess the ESB&rsquo;s costs and set the conditions again for October.  That is the regulatory process that works effectively here and in every other liberalised market.  We are delivering competition and lower prices.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <Quest> if he has completed an audit of all State owned broadband infrastructure; if he will publish the findings of such results; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24370/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The consultation paper on next generation broadband, which I launched in July 2008, proposed the establishment of a one-stop shop to provide service providers with flexible and open access to existing and future State-owned infrastructure for telecommunications services.  Trade over digital networks is becoming increasingly important and access to high-speed broadband networks will be necessary if indigenous and foreign-owned enterprises in the regions are to prosper in the smart economy.  Leveraging publicly owned ducting has the capacity to reduce costs significantly for private sector investors in rolling out fibre-optic cabling to the regions and thereby improve competition in the electronic communications market.</P>
        <P>The idea of a one-stop shop received a largely positive response in the consultation process on the NGB draft paper and contributors recognised the potential of utilising State assets to provide fibre networks in the regions.  Officials from my Department have worked with the relevant State agencies in the energy and transport sectors to compile a database of the supply of publicly owned infrastructure which can currently or potentially support high-speed broadband networks.  Following this process, maps were compiled which provide an indicative depiction of the supply and gaps in relevant State infrastructure.  The maps also include the metropolitan area networks, an important component of broadband connectivity in the regions.  These maps will be included in the final version of the next generation broadband policy paper, which will be launched shortly.</P>
        <P>These maps indicate that there is an extensive network of State infrastructure which has the potential to improve our broadband infrastructure significantly. However, the readiness of the State infrastructure to be utilised as telecommunications infrastructure varies greatly between the different agencies.  For example, some agencies are already making their infrastructure available while others have not done so or have no local infrastructure in place.  Another factor is that some publicly-owned infrastructure may be subject to existing contractual arrangements and may not be currently available on an open access basis.  Nevertheless, I am determined to move on the process speedily so that optimal utilisation of these assets can be achieved.  The next step in developing the one-stop shop is to decide on the best operational model.  I expect to make a decision on this in the summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that information.  It is a bugbear of mine that it has taken so long to put in place an audit to establish the amount of broadband infrastructure owned by the State and its agencies or companies.  That information is required in order that we can begin to concentrate on bridging the gaps in existing services to ensure we have a modern broadband infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that the job has now been done.  He indicated that the results will be included in the policy paper on next generation broadband which will be pub<Col N="294"/>lished &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  Will he provide a specific date?  It is difficult not to be cynical about the timetable that has been set out for broadband roll-out when one considers how long it has taken the Department even to put in place a management contract for the second phase of the metropolitan area networks, MANs, project.  I ask for a definitive indication of the date of publication of the policy paper on next generation broadband so that we can move on to have a proper debate on these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The report will be published within days.  As I said, the work has been done and the crucial issue now is how to use the information.  We are all agreed on the concept of providing access to State infrastructure.  One option is to go for a public private partnership model whereby an external body would be brought in to manage the variety of different assets available in a single one-stop shop.  Alternatively, we could deploy an existing provider, possibly a State company, to take over the other assets and operate them on a one-stop basis.  Whichever option we choose, what is important is that we provide that access in a way that helps all operators.  The objective is a platform and operator neutral provision of much higher bandwidth speeds throughout the country using State infrastructure to support commercial investment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am excited by the Minister&rsquo;s response.  What he has outlined is precisely what we should be doing.  In a recent policy document, my party set out its view on how we should proceed in regard to State-owned broadband infrastructure.  We have proposed the establishment of a new State company and the amalgamation of some existing bodies to manage that infrastructure.  I look forward to the Minister developing his ideas and hopefully taking on board some of the proposals my party has made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>While we have had difficulties arising from lack of investment in some of our networks, we enjoy certain advantages in some of the mobile technologies that have developed here.  We also have an advantage in terms of the fibre optic under State ownership which we can use to help companies provide the bandwidths we require.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if he will introduce a grant support scheme for the upgrading of windows in homes in line with the objectives of the greener homes scheme and the home energy saving scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[24371/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The home energy saving, HES, scheme, which opened for applications on 25 March, provides grant assistance for a range of energy efficiency applications.  These include roof insulation, as well as specific internal and external wall insulation, and boilers and heating controls.  Grant assistance is also provided for the assessment of energy upgrade requirements, through a building energy rating, BER, before and after the remedial works.  Applications were selected for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of expert advice from Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, and in light of the pilot phase of the scheme last year.  SEI recommended those applications to my Department which it considered optimum in terms of delivering significant energy savings to home owners at least cost and as representing best use of budgetary resources.</P>
        <P>Replacement windows are not currently eligible for grant assistance under the scheme.  My Department and SEI are keeping the scheme under constant review and will continue to give consideration to the scope for adding other measures, subject to budgetary and technical considerations.  Similar to the greener homes scheme, it is anticipated that the HES scheme will <Col N="295"/>evolve and adapt as it rolls out and as the market for these applications matures.  This may give rise to changes to the applications eligible under the scheme over time.</P>
        <P>To date, there has been very strong interest in taking up grant offers for the existing six measures.  Since the scheme opened less than three months ago, grants worth &euro;16 million have been offered to 12,000 home owners nationwide.  There are critical benefits accruing for the construction industry from the scheme in terms of economic activity, retraining and job retention.  To date, more than 2,000 contractors have registered with SEI to install approved applications under the scheme, with a similar number of BER assessors also being deployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to recognise that the home energy saving scheme is operating well.  However, as I have discussed with the Minister on previous occasions, there are concerns about SEI-registered companies charging more than they should.  We must ensure there is effective competition in terms of pricing so that home owners get the best possible value from the companies that are registered.</P>
        <P>The focus of this question is whether the scheme can be extended to include windows.  In most cases, up to 40% of heat loss from a room is lost through closed windows.  It is not good value for money to insulate walls and ceilings if the room contains single glazed or poorly double glazed windows.  If we are serious about upgrading the stock of approximately 2 million houses throughout the State, we must tackle the issue of insulation for windows as well as walls and ceilings.  Windows represent a problem in terms of energy efficiency in most housing stock that is more than five years old.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It makes sense to replace existing windows with energy efficient ones.  Many people live in the same house for 20 or 30 years and it is only logical that energy efficient improvements should be as effective as possible.  The reason we selected certain insulation technologies and control systems for inclusion in the HES scheme was their very short payback period of typically three, four or five years.  Investing in windows takes longer, sometimes taking 20 or 30 years to achieve payback.  We wanted to get the most extensive return possible from the budget we have.</P>
        <P>I am keeping the scheme under review to see how it  works out.  As I said, it has advantages in terms of employment generation as well as energy efficiency by providing jobs in the construction industry.  I have asked SEI to report back to me after the first three months to see how the scheme is progressing, how we are using our budget and whether adjustments are required.  I will await its advice before making any changes.  The scheme is working as it was intended, although I would like to see applications coming in faster.  I am confident that will happen as energy service companies begin to promote the scheme and find ways of getting large numbers of houses done quickly.  I am not ruling out an extension to the scheme as proposed by the Deputy but I do not wish to raise his expectations.  We will continue to monitor and review the scheme as we do with all such schemes on an ongoing basis.</P>

        <Quest> his views on whether the &euro;600 million cost of the east-west interconnector represents value for money in terms of construction and completion costs versus similar projects in other parts of Europe; if he is satisfied that the tendering process has ensured this; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>EirGrid, with the approval of the Government, is developing, on schedule, the east-west interconnector.  The Government is fully committed to the cost effective delivery of the interconnector as a key strategic energy infrastructure project.</P>
        <P>There are several benefits for the economy, the energy market and consumers from this development.  It will enhance security of energy supply by delivering additional capacity to the all-island electricity market and linking it to the United Kingdom, which is, in turn, connected to mainland European markets.  It will underpin delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s renewable generation targets by providing additional back-up at times of low wind and enabling the export of wind energy from Ireland at times of high wind generation.  It will support further competition in the electricity market and exert downward pressure on prices.  It will allow for a diversification of the national fuel mix and supply sources by reducing our dependence on electricity generated from imported natural gas.  In addition, it will provide EirGrid, as the system operator, with important back-up and reserve services.</P>
        <P>The Government has been advised by EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, that over the lifetime of the project, these benefits will more than outweigh the development costs.  In a strong endorsement by the European Union, Ireland has secured &euro;110 million for the east-west interconnector under the European economic recovery plan.  This funding will be an important component of the overall financial package.  In making cost comparisons, it should be borne in mind that each electricity interconnector project is a unique development.  Interconnectors throughout Europe and elsewhere vary in terms of capacity, length, diversity of terrain and the proportion of the project that is  below sea or on land.</P>
        <P>The contract for the development of the east-west interconnector was awarded on foot of an open tender process conducted by EirGrid under the regulatory oversight of the CER.  Both EirGrid and the CER have advised that the contract price negotiated with the successful bidder represents full value for money in a very competitive process.  I am satisfied, on the basis of the comprehensive advice by EirGrid and CER to me and to my Department, that the contract is economically advantageous and that EirGrid is on schedule to deliver the east-west interconnector by 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the building of an east-west interconnector and one of the scale proposed is necessary.  My only question relates to whether we are paying too much for it.  I met representatives of the CER and put that question to them.  I also requested that they forward to me details relating to the other companies which submitted tenders in respect of this matter.  However, I have not yet received such information.</P>
        <P>I have been contacted by a number of independent people who are not linked with companies such as Imera and others and who put very convincing arguments to me to the effect that we are paying approximately one third or one quarter above what we should be paying for this item of infrastructure.  I welcome the fact the European Commission will probably provide &euro;100 million of the &euro;600 million required for the project.  However, that does not excuse the fact that we may be paying too much.  We should not be obliged to pay &euro;600 million for a project which should only cost &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister correctly stated that every project is different.  However, if one compares this project to others of similar scale and size, one will not find another project that is more expensive.  One can list four or five projects that were 25% less expensive than that relating to the east-west interconnector.  The Minister has a responsibility in this regard because consumers and businesses, not EirGrid, will be obliged to pay for this project.  EirGrid will merely manage the project and facilitate the transfer of money from those who use the interconnector and benefit from it to those who build it.</P><Col N="297"/>
        <P>Has the Minister considered the tendering project?  Did he examine the other tenders that were received?  What were the prices relating to these tenders and which companies submitted them?  Apart from simply taking the word of those who represent the CER and EirGrid, is he satisfied that we are not being overcharged in respect of this project?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The first point is that it is a hard market in which to buy cables because demand is outstripping supply.  In view of the small number of companies producing the relevant technology and the demand therefor, it is extremely difficult to obtain even a booking with a factory to have a cable produced.  Transbay Cable in California would have charged $500 million to produce a cable that would have been shorter and would have yielded less power than that which we are developing.  There are other examples but the circumstances relating to each is different and is dependent on geography and grid connection upgrades.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Transbay Cable option would have been cheaper. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but the cable would have been shorter and less powerful.  This provides some form of benchmark.</P>
        <P>We are satisfied that the contract and tendering process was proper and above board.  The crucial assessment comes down to what will be the benefits.  EirGrid, separate to any of the international companies, carried out such an assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the point. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the point. </P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is not the point. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a benefit of some &euro;66 million to the electricity market in this country per annum. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This means the net benefit of the project to the consumer and the electricity market will be extremely positive. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We needed the Luas as well but that also cost too much to build. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to determine what represents the right price.  We engaged in a tendering process involving three major, world-renowned companies.  Only one of those companies could be successful.  I acknowledge it is a seller&rsquo;s rather than a buyer&rsquo;s market.  However, we obtained a competitive bid which stands up to international comparison.  The benefits to the consumer and the electricity market of this project will far outweigh the costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Question Nos. 7, 8 and 22 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In conjunction with the Minister for Transport, I have announced plans for the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  The target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020 will equate to 250,000 cars on Irish roads.</P>
        <P>The interdeparmental-interagency task force is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives from the Departments of Transport, Finance, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, the ESB, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  The membership of the task force was chosen to ensure a fully cohesive approach across Departments and agencies in the context of planning the development of electric transportation infrastructure.  ESB Networks has a pivotal role to play in this process.  While I consider the membership of the task force to be appropriate at this stage, I will keep under review the need to co-opt other expertise as matters progress.</P>
        <P>The task force is developing the options and timeframe for putting in place the necessary infrastructure and other arrangements for the national roll-out of electric vehicles.  Initial estimates for the roll-out of infrastructure indicate it will take between 12 and 18 months, depending on the scale of initial deployment.  Global developments will be factored in as the technologies mature.  The task force will shortly report its initial findings and advise on the next steps.  Three working groups have been established under the aegis of the task force.  These are the transport infrastructure, fiscal and enterprise groups.  The work of these groups will inform the task force&rsquo;s main report.  Employment opportunities, the costs involved in providing car-charging infrastructure and all associated issues, including funding options, will be addressed in the report.</P>
        <P>The memorandum of understanding I recently concluded with Renault-Nissan will greatly increase the level of knowledge available on the infrastructure requirements of electric vehicles and ensure that Ireland has the opportunity to be one of the first countries to be supplied with both Renault and Nissan electric cars.  This represents a major opportunity for Ireland.  Under the memorandum of understanding, ESB Networks will be able to avail of data on developments in electric vehicles which will inform our consideration of optimum infrastructure, support mechanisms and the potential benefits accruing.</P>
        <P>The memorandum of understanding does not convey any exclusive rights in respect of the provision of electric cars.  Ireland is open for business to all manufacturers of electric vehicles and I hope to build relationships with all global players in the sector.  I also hope to develop relationships with the ICT companies that will provide the data management and communications infrastructure that will be required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply but I must state he did not tell us a huge amount.  When his Department issued a press release in respect of this matter, we were informed that a working group was to be established.  I do not mean to nit-pick but this has metamorphosed into a task force to which three working groups are attached.  That is a matter of concern because it appears there will be much deliberation but not many results.  The press <Col N="299"/>release issued by the Minister promised that the electric vehicles working group would publish its report in April but this clearly did not happen.  When will that report be published?</P>
        <P>The Minister did not indicate whether industry representatives are included in the membership of the task force.  He stated the initial roll out will take between 12 to 18 months.  What does this mean?  How will the strategy relating to this matter actually work?  A target of 10% has been set and a task force has been established.  However, the nature of the strategy is unclear.  What legislative requirements will be necessary to ensure the target is achieved?</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent days it emerged that there is a real danger of electricity blackouts in Dublin as a result of insufficient capacity.  Has the Minister, in conjunction with the ESB, given consideration to this matter in the context of the additional capacity that would be required to meet the target he has set in respect of the roll-out of electric vehicles?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not have an exact date for the publication of the report.  However, it will be issued shortly.  I will provide the Deputy with a broad outline of what we envisage will happen over the first two years of the strategy.  The first point to make is that the strategy is dependent on the availability of suitable vehicles.  Nothing can be done until such vehicles become available. From listening to the companies, several hundred vehicles will become available by the end of next year.  It will probably start towards the latter part of next year.  By 2011 the figure should be around a couple of thousand as the scheme ramps up, depending on the level of vehicle availability from the manufacturers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That will require roughly 1,500 power charging points, probably starting in the cities, concentrating in Dublin and the larger urban centres first, then rolling it out around the country.  That presupposes the ability of any householder to have a simple plug-in  connection so that he or she may charge from home.  There will be widespread availability of charging facilities on a domestic basis, but we shall need to back that up in apartment blocks, car parks and on-street facilities as well as with a number of super charging points where within half an hour one might get an 80% charge, that will enable one, say, to get from Dublin to Cork.  We shall need those at mid-points between our cities as the system evolves in the first year or two.</P>
        <P>That is the first crucial development, having a countrywide, particularly urban, structure of power in place as well as the vehicles available from the manufacturers.  In this regard we have the advantage, and now we know we have it.  I mentioned that  the whole ICT digital service area is behind this because we shall need fairly complex software.  It needs to be an open access system in terms of being available for any vehicle manufacturer and as such is not exclusive.  Also, down the line it will be supplier neutral in terms of the fact that different electricity supply companies will be able to sell through it &mdash; and that requires a good complex smart grid system.</P>
        <P>Those are the bones of what I see happening in the next two years and what we learn and gain from that initiative we shall deploy very widely.  There has been continuous questioning regarding the Dublin grid in terms of the volume of power supply being used in the city.  However, there has been very significant investment in both the transmission and distribution network in Dublin and this is ongoing.  The ESB is raising and spending significant capital on its network and other generation facilities.  I am confident its involvement in this project is central to provide a co-ordinated response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister, in particular, for his second response to the effect that we are certain to get more detail in respect of the electric car project.  My view is that we need to take a field of dreams philosophy here, of &ldquo;build it and they&rsquo;ll come&rdquo; because people will not buy into electric cars until they see that this is a major State project for Ireland. <Col N="300"/> We are transforming our transport fleet from carbon-based fuels to electricity.  We have the capacity to do this in a dramatic way if the Minister is aggressively pushing this project.  However, it will not be helpful if we take a cautious approach towards putting charging points in place between now and the end of 2011 of up to even 1,500.  This is something that needs to be rolled out in a more ambitious manner and I encourage the Minister to be ambitious in that regard.  I have a number of questions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Are we seeking memorandums of understanding with other car manufacturers?  I know that manufacturers other than Nissan-Renault are seeking to actively pursue the electric car market as well and we should ensure that consumers in Ireland will have choice.  Are we seeking further memorandums of understanding in terms of charging points outside the ESB network?  Again, that needs to be very much open to a tendering process and the benefits of competition.</P>
        <P>Finally, are we consulting with the Northern Ireland Assembly about sharing this project to make it an all-island initiative?  There are clear reasons why we should be doing that, in terms of developing the same type of transport system on the island of Ireland.  The advantage of our being an island is that our cars primarily stay in Ireland, unlike many other European countries, which makes it easier for us to transform our transport fleet within a relatively short period of time, as long as we can get the cars.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are seeking memorandums of understanding with other manufacturers because crucially, car availability is the constraint.  I fully agree with the Deputy.  We should be ambitious in this regard and ahead of the curve as a country.  In a sense we should be ahead of the people in providing facilities for them because I believe this will be enormously positive for the country. </P>
        <P>We are also looking at memorandums of understanding with other supply system companies, in whatever format, while recognising crucially that in any supply system there has to be open access.  It has to be something that different operators can switch in and out of.</P>
        <P>I have to check the relationship the working group has with Northern Ireland.  I believe we are ahead of the UK in this, in terms of what is being done there, but there is no reason why Northern Ireland and the Republic cannot synergise on this because of the obvious benefits to be derived from an all-island common approach, and I will support that.</P>
        <P>This has to be something that also makes sense, economically.  We will do whatever we can, in Government, to assist.  We have already introduced tax breaks for fleet purchasers &mdash; advance capital allowances for anyone purchasing electric vehicles.  We have given significant VRT and tax allowances for electric vehicles and people must have real security as regards those measures.  There is a range of different measures we can employ in Government, but the Deputies can have my absolute commitment that it makes sense for us, not just on the transport side, but in terms of the back-up benefits that will accrue regarding the development of a smart grid, and as a location where some of the ICT technologies can progress &mdash; as well as for service solutions which can then be sold elsewhere.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 43 together. </P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the national broadband scheme, NBS, in December 2008.  Within my Department, the implementation of the NBS is being overseen at senior management level by full-time civil servants at the grades of assistant secretary and principal officer.  Responsibility for day-to-day project management and administration of the NBS rests with a team comprising of an assistant principal officer, a higher executive officer and a clerical officer.  Additional specialist technical and legal resources are available to the project from within my Department, when required.  The contract places onerous requirements on &ldquo;3&rdquo; in respect of programme delivery and compliance with technical and service level requirements.  These are important features to ensure best return for the overall Exchequer investment in the scheme of &euro;79.8 million.  In these circumstances, it is necessary that the Department should have specialist outside assistance.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, Analysys Mason Limited was engaged by my Department in January 2009 for a 28 month period to provide technical, financial and commercial advice, along with support to my officials in relation to project management and monitoring of the rollout and implementation of the NBS.  As the network is rolled out and services are delivered in the NBS coverage area, Analysys Mason will assist in validating coverage achieved in individual electoral divisions and in monitoring the performance of the infrastructure, service availability, service delivery and quality, customer experience as well as overall compliance by &ldquo;3&rdquo; with contractual obligations.</P>
        <P>To date, Analysys Mason Limited has provided ongoing advice in relation to a range of matters, including the establishment of project governance structures and reporting systems to underpin clear and effective monitoring of the roll-out of the NBS and performance delivery by &ldquo;3&rdquo;.  In addition, it has elaborated on processes within the NBS contract to verify broadband coverage and to validate service delivery and quality as well as the achievement of contractual obligations.</P>
        <P>My Department also has available an individual resource with relevant ICT expertise who provides day-to-day administrative support in relation to NBS project management and implementation.  Since the signature of the NBS contract, an amount of &euro;67,845, excluding VAT, has been paid in respect of the advisory services outlined above.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it always envisage that this consultant would be included in the actual management of the scheme?  Was this incorporated into it from the very beginning?  I am not quibbling, but I wonder whether this was incorporated into the scheme.  There is a real danger that if we have to get expertise  we have to go outside the Department for various reasons in terms of staff numbers being reduced. </P>
        <P>In terms of the management of the contract, was it always the intention to employ outside consultants?</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have to check the stage at which that was included but I imagine it is because it is fairly standard procedure in some of our other similar projects.  For example, the MANS always had a technical advisory component as it was being implemented as well as at the concept stage.  On similar projects there is always that technical outside assessment of whether it is being delivered.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="302"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>What budget is allowed over the 28 months?  The Minister has indicated the money that has already been spent on this consultancy but what will the total amount be between now and the final period?  When will the broadband scheme be completed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is to be rolled out in September 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>So it is 28 months to the full completion.  Could the Minister give me a figure on how much the consultancy will cost?  Has the Minister examined planning applications and permissions to see if there is any danger of delays?  I am concerned about the old chestnut of mobile broadband where a rural business comes under this scheme but there are complaints about the efficiency of mobile broadband.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s intentions about meeting the needs of the 20,000 households that will still be outside the scheme when it is completed?</P>
        <P>The Minister probably saw the Economist Intelligence Unit&rsquo;s annual ranking of e-readiness and I note that Ireland has improved somewhat, essentially because of the recession.  However, when one examines the detail of the analysis it appears the Government has held us back in terms of a lack of strategic approach whereas business appears to be more e-ready than we are here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The 28-month tendered bid was for a total of &euro;399,000 and for the various stages of that right through to the end of the scheme.  The Minister asked whether we can be certain there will be no planning delays.  One cannot be certain.  This is a very complex project which covers the entire country.  Masts have to be put up involving very significant, complex backhaul works involving new technology.  No doubt there will be difficulties on the route to delivering it but Hutchison 3G is very confident and there are conditions set in the contract that it will meet the targets, the 48% of areas being covered by December this year and full coverage being rolled out at the end of September 2010.  Part of the task in my Department and with the consultants we have working is to keep a continuous eye on that and ensure difficulties are overcome and targets are met.</P>
        <P>The technology is working in the areas where it has been rolled out, initially tentatively in a small number of areas.  In the technical analysis of the speeds in the areas, the contention is that this technology is working.  It is leading edge in terms of mobile broadband technology but it is proving to be very robust.  Some of the innovations and technologies within it, such as the receiver one would have in one&rsquo;s home to pick up the signal and apply it in the home, are proving very robust.  The latest technology is being deployed, it is working and our key attention within the Department and with our consultants is to ensure it is deployed effectively across the country.</P>
        <P>We are examining ways we can get to those remaining customers who for a number of different reasons are in areas which do not come under either the national broadband scheme or alternative coverage and how we can plug that gap.  I welcome and appreciate Deputy McManus&rsquo;s comments on the improvement in e-readiness around the country.  The Deputy is correct that the Government must work further on this.  I am very confident that the work being done by CMOD in developing the Government&rsquo;s use of broadband technologies and improving our services will bring us further up the international table.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which it got from the Department was approximately 20,000.  Can the Minister give us an idea who those people are and why they are not covered by the national broadband scheme, which was supposed to be an effort at universal coverage across the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>A couple of years ago in my old house in Ranelagh I could not get broadband because of a paired split on the DSL line.  I eventually got it by putting a fixed wire connection to a distant point.  There is a range of different reasons.  Largely the areas are where electoral districts had the vast majority of homes covered by existing subscribers, and under European competition rules we were precluded from going in.  This is an area where one had 5% or 10% of the electoral district, which is the lowest level we can come down to.  That was an insufficient number to allow us to go in under competition rules.  I am working from memory but I understand the number is in the order of 12,000 homes but I could be wrong.  We are examining ways we can plug that last gap.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 10 and 38 together.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of the national smart metering programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government&rsquo;s energy policy framework and in the programme for Government.  The smart metering programme is a central component of the strategy to radically enhance management of energy demand and to deliver greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.</P>
        <P>This is a highly complex technology project.  The trials are essential to ensure the optimum and most cost-effective technology and systems are identified for the implementation phase.  The electricity element of the pilot phase is expected to be completed at the end of December 2010.  It is important to have a trial that captures seasonal changes in usage for peak demand management purposes.  The outcome should be a fully informed decision on the most suitable model of smart meter-IT system, tariffing structure, communications system and demand stimuli.  The model must have the proven capability to deliver the anticipated benefits of smart metering, taking account of the specifics of the Irish energy system.</P>
        <P>The pilot phase encompasses two strands.  The technology trial is testing a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure.  The customer behaviour trial will determine the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable <Col N="304"/>change in consumer behaviour.  The technology trial will examine metering functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  This trial will involve the installation of up to 8,000 meters.  Installation of the first 2,000 meters for technology testing is due to begin next month.</P>
        <P>The 6,000 participants for the customer behaviour trial have been selected to ensure the sample is representative of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity consumers both in terms of usage profiles and geographical spread.  Installation of meters for this trial is almost complete with 5,364 residential and 595 SME meters installed at 8 June.</P>
        <P>Given the advanced stage of work under way to put in place the systems needed for the pilot, it will not be possible to include the new residential BGE electricity customers in the customer behaviour trial.  BGE is involved in the SME element of the trial and will be able to avail of the findings of the residential electricity customer behaviour trial.  The specifications of these metering systems will allow the testing of a range of functions to deliver enhanced demand management.  These include interval metering reading, time of use tariffing and the use of in-home display devices.  They will also provide reliable quality data on actual energy use which will lead to significantly better services to consumers.  These include improved fault monitoring and outage recording, power quality monitoring, reduced theft and losses and improved network planning.</P>
        <P>The gas element of the smart metering programme is also moving ahead.  Over 1,900 customers are expected to participate in gas customer behaviour trials.  A further 750 meters will be installed to facilitate the gas technology trials.  Customers for the gas customer behaviour trial will be recruited by the end of July 2009.  The trial period will begin in June 2010 and will continue until May 2011.</P>
        <P>The estimated cost of the pilot is &euro;34.9 million.  This comprises &euro;29.9 million for the electricity element and &euro;5 million for the gas element.  The cost of a national roll-out will be determined on foot of the results of the pilot programme and decisions taken on the optimum type of cost effective smart metering system that will deliver the level of functionality required in an Irish market.</P>
        <P>A key component of the pilot phase is the associated cost-benefit analysis which is under way and which will critically inform future decisions.  An interim analysis will be completed next year with the final analysis, to include the results of the gas trials, to be completed by mid-2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  The Minister&rsquo;s original commitment made in November 2007 was for 25,000 homes with an estimated cost of &euro;10 million and the first meters to be installed in the second quarter of 2008.  It seems the information the Minister is now giving us is rather different from that plan set out in 2007.  Why was there such a difference between the two?</P>
        <P>The national roll-out was indicated in previous press releases as being over five years.  It is a pretty costly business and one of the questions I have been asked to ask the Minister is who pays.  Obviously ultimately the customer pays for services provided.  How will that be structured for individuals with smart meters?  While I appreciate this is at the experimental stage, I do not want that as an answer.  There needs to be some specification or brief as to what this will do.  There is a genuine concern that the ultimate beneficiary of smart metering will be the provider rather than the consumer.  How does the Minister envisage the benefits being spread between the provider and the consumer?</P><Col N="305"/>
        <P Just="Left">It seems quite tough on the people who took the advice of availing of the competition in the market, over which the Minister is very proud to have presided, and moved to An Bord G&aacute;is or Airtricity.  It seems they are now blocked from being involved in the smart meter programme.  Why is that the case?  I had understood that even if a consumer moved to another provider the meter still belonged to the ESB.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to the question as to who pays and who benefits, the Deputy is correct that the supply companies will benefit and it is designed to do that.  The first benefit is that there is less theft.  With more control over where electricity is going and real-time information as to what is happening, the experience internationally has been real savings, which may be single-digit but are still significant in reducing theft.  The provider also achieves savings from the cost of managing that system.  It is right that the supply companies should benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The consumer, however, also benefits.  One of the reasons it is more expensive is that we are taking more time but it is being done in the correct way to get it right.  As well as the technology and the companies&rsquo; systems we are really testing how people react and use the technology.  That is probably the most important factor for the pilot&rsquo;s success or otherwise.  If through better monitors or display systems consumers can see what they are using and can start to make savings, then they start to win.  With systems that can switch off appliances automatically and which have control systems allowing consumers to have much greater control over what they are doing, consumers start to win.  The ultimate objective is to reduce the energy use in homes.  All the international evidence suggests consumers can do that with proper measurement when they know what is going on.</P>
        <P>The companies and the consumers will benefit.  While it is expensive and there are costs involved in the set-up and trial period, I am convinced it is the right way to go.  Every other advanced economy is planning to implement this.  The benefit for us in developing a smart grid system here, starting from the smart meter and including the electric vehicle in the driveway that can be plugged into a socket in the hallway, is that this is an area where considerable international attention and investment is coming.  Many jobs can be developed out of the systems here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Bord G&aacute;is consumers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I need to check on that matter and revert to the Deputy.  Obviously, Bord G&aacute;is&rsquo;s entry into the market occurred at a late stage when we were very advanced in this trial system.  I would need to check what happens when a consumer swaps.  This is a meter being installed by the ESB and it is part of its distribution grid system.  That is not to say the information and all the other aspects of it will not be fully available to all other companies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last point, the ESB distribution system is an entirely separate operation from ESB Power Generation.  I presume consumers switching to Bord G&aacute;is, Airtricity or any other new electricity supplier should still keep the system that was put in place just as they will keep their wires.  It would be farcical if people could not switch electricity supplier for fear of using their energy monitoring system in their homes.  If that were the case the ESB would have a complete stranglehold on the market unless other companies were to provide similar information systems, which is essentially the kind of smart metering system the Minister envisages.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has not answered the question as to why we have gone from having a supposed pilot project of 25,000 smart meters, which should have begun their roll-out in the middle of <Col N="306"/>last year, to now limiting our ambition to 8,000.  Why is that the case?  Is the Minister not concerned that the pilot project will only conclude &mdash; if all goes well between now and the end of it &mdash; by the end of 2010 and then the review period will continue into 2011?  It will be mid to late 2011 before we make decisions on whether to roll out a national programme of smart meters.  That is two to three years away.  In the meantime, we are trying to create a smart grid that can facilitate electric cars, micro-generation whereby people sell back to the grid excess power they produce in the home through solar panels, small wind turbines or other systems they might be using.  I am concerned that in an effort to get this right we will take an ultra-cautious approach and will drag our feet for the next two to three years analysing a project that I believe we all know will be a success.</P>
        <P>Should the ultimate goal not be to have in every house in the country a net meter, which measures electricity, gas and water so that we have a utilities smart meter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I need to call the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect we will get towards that ideal but we will have wasted all this time on the planning project for electricity alone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of houses to participate in this test phase is close to 17,000.  Originally it was 21,000.  The detailed calculation was done and it was seen that we could deliver the analysis we needed on that basis.  It is not a question of whether we are going to do this but how we can best do it.  It is a programme for Government commitment and it makes sense.  As with anything in the energy area or other areas it is right to test for the best technology, get the real human interaction &mdash; the behavioural use &mdash; right, and then deploy.  After that period at the end of next year I do not envisage great agonising as to whether we will proceed.  It will be a question of putting into effect the lessons we have learnt from the test scheme in order to facilitate micro-generation and to facilitate not just electricity metering but also gas and other services going into the home.  That is what we are doing in the trial test period.  We are carrying out the most advanced, integrated, complex metering possible because we believe that will benefit the Irish householder into future years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bord G&aacute;is customer is treated in exactly the same way as the ESB customer.  The ESB makes the switch on the basis of a phone call.  The software allows all the billing and other information to go to Bord G&aacute;is.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I happen to be a Bord G&aacute;is customer.  The Minister sent an e-mail &mdash; I presume Deputy Coveney received the same e-mail &mdash; suggesting that I become part of the pilot scheme.  A Bord G&aacute;is customer cannot avail of the offer.  I am not bothered for myself but by the idea that there is a limitation because someone chooses to take their electricity from a source other than the ESB.  As Deputy Coveney said, the two things are separate and should always be so. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the past three months, road deaths have increased from their 2008 levels.  In May there were 32 deaths on our roads, up from 19 deaths in the same period in 2008.</P>
        <P>I am seriously concerned that improvements in road safety are being eroded.  I note with despair that a recent report on RTE News stated that Ireland has been severely criticised by the European Transport Safety Council in respect of our failure to implement certain key aspects of the road safety strategy.  In particular, we have failed to roll out the promised safety camera programme and all but abolished the successful Road Safety Authority advertising campaign.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year, 279 people were killed on our roads and thousands of others injured.  Based on the most recent figures from the Road Safety Authority, the cost of all accidents reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is &euro;1.38 billion.  Unless someone takes ownership of this project more families will lose their loved ones, more people will be maimed, more families will lose breadwinners and more families will endure untold heartache.  I have received nothing but hollow assurances in this House in replies to questions on this matter, stating that discussions are ongoing between the Department of Transport and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance.  I am calling on the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children to support the road safety strategy of the Road Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by providing the necessary funding to support the RSA&rsquo;s advertising campaign and implementing the promised safety camera programme.</P>
        <P>Ireland is lagging far behind countries such as France, the Netherlands, Finland and the United Kingdom in respect of its roll-out of speed cameras.  In France in 2001, some 8,000 <Col N="308"/>people lost their lives on French roads, but that figure has since fallen by 50%, with 4,000 people having died on French roads in 2008.  Speed cameras were introduced during that period.  The delay in this process can only be put down to incompetence.  Poland and Lithuania began their speed camera tendering processes after Ireland and now have those cameras in operation, while we are still waiting for them.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister of State to support the road safety strategy initiatives including the roll-out of safety cameras.  These initiatives will have a positive effect on Irish drivers.  They will reduce excessive speeding and increase compliance on the roads.  Speed affects the outcome of every accident.  By reducing speeds, we can reduce the effect of road traffic collisions, thereby saving lives.</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport put the speed cameras contract out to tender two years ago and several Irish companies with international partners incurred significant costs in tendering for that contract.  The successful company, with partners who are proven experts in road safety, incurred considerable additional costs in further advancing the project.  This project will create 100 jobs throughout Ireland, with 40 in Listowel, my home town.  It will create jobs in Donegal and along the west coast.  These are employment black spots and need every job that can be provided, but the Government has abandoned them.  Most damning of all is that while speed cameras are likely to be a revenue-neutral initiative, the cost in lives saved could never be measured.  I appeal to the Minister of State to convey the sentiments I have expressed this evening to the Minister for Transport and to plead with him to ensure that the contract will proceed as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>According to the recent report of the European Transport Safety Council:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">While the introduction of a speed camera system in the Republic of Ireland is one of the main features of the Irish Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy, it has been hit with delay after delay.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The latest hold up comes after the Republic&rsquo;s Minister for Finance confirmed in late 2008 that a &euro;10 million budget was being provided for the introduction of a speed camera programme in 2009.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This has been promised but has not been delivered.  I hope that in the interests of road safety and saving lives it will be delivered as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to Deputy Deenihan for the absence of the Minister Justice, Equality and Law Reform who unfortunately is unable to be present due to other business.</P>
        <P>The Government attaches a high priority to road safety and the prevention of deaths and serious injuries on our roads.  This commitment is set out in concrete form in its road safety strategy.  One of the actions in the strategy is the provision of a network of safety cameras.  In pursuance of this action, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is engaged in a procurement process for outsourcing the provision and operation of safety cameras, in accordance with EU directives, national public procurement procedures and relevant legislation.  As a result, a preferred supplier has been selected.</P>
        <P>Discussions are taking place between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Transport and Finance and the Garda with a view to making every effort to proceed with this project as quickly as possible.  In the current economic climate, we must do everything possible to achieve value for money, especially on a project of this scale.  The aim, however, is to proceed <Col N="309"/>with this project as soon as possible.  Until contract discussions are concluded, it is not possible to indicate a timescale for the project.</P>
        <P>We cannot and will not become complacent, as even one death or injury on our roads is too many.  The Departments and agencies responsible for road safety are tackling rigorously driver behaviour in the context of the road safety strategy.  One of the strategic goals in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na corporate strategy 2007-09 is to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries on the roads and improve road safety.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to focus its enforcement activities on the main causes of death and serious injury on the roads, speeding, drink driving and failure to wear safety belts.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with the National Roads Authority, has completed an extensive analysis of the collision history on the road network.  Sections of road have been identified where a significant proportion of collisions occurred in which speed was deemed the primary contributory factor.  The public will continue to be made aware of roads which have been identified as having a propensity for speed related collisions, including through the Garda website.</P>
        <P>Considerable resources are now available for traffic policing.  There has been a significant increase in the personnel of the traffic corps which stood at 1,092 at the end of March, an increase of 92% since 2005.  The emphasis of Garda speed enforcement is on the use of mobile speed cameras, and the force&rsquo;s capacity in this area has been substantially enhanced recently.  In September 2008, the Minister, in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner, launched eight new Garda mobile speed detection vehicles.  These state-of-the-art vehicles represent a substantial upgrading of the resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address the problem of speeding on our roads.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has over 400 hand-held speed detection devices.  In addition, there are several fixed camera installation posts at various locations in the Dublin area and the Louth-Meath division, and cameras are rotated between these posts.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities have also procured an automated number plate recognition system, ANPR and are finalising its roll-out.  The new system allows for automatic in-car detection by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of stolen vehicles, untaxed vehicles and vehicles on Garda lists.  The Garda, therefore, will not only gain improved intelligence on persons known to them, be able to deny the use of roads to criminals and detect drivers who do not pay their motor tax, but they will also have enhanced traffic law enforcement capabilities, including the detection of speeding.</P>
        <P>These initiatives are contributing to the significant progress being made in the area of road safety.   Looking at the overall figures, the trend in fatal collisions has been favourable for the past number of years, decreasing from 365 in 2006 to 338 in 2007 and to 279 last year.  Progress in reducing fatalities is continuing in 2009.  To date this year, 16 fewer people have been killed on our roads, compared with the same period last year.  Every effort will be made to ensure this progress continues.  I can assure the Deputy that saving lives through making our roads safer will remain an absolute Government priority, including taking effective, efficient and targeted measures to reduce speeding.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The recent revelations in the Ryan report have shocked, angered and saddened all of us.  Having discussed the report in detail last week, we are now struggling to come to terms with its findings and how best to move forward.  It is almost impossible to comprehend the emotions of those who have been abused and whose wounds must be reopened.  However, as I was contacted by relatives of the victims at the weekend, I have been able to get a little insight into their needs at this time.  I have spoken to people whose loved <Col N="310"/>ones have died while in care, and who have found difficulty over the years in locating their resting place.</P>
        <P>I spoke on Saturday to one of these relatives, whose uncle was committed to one of these institutions at the tender age of eight years, and died aged 13.  Freddie was born the eldest of three children in 1921, and his mother died in 1927.  He had two siblings; a brother who died last year at the age of 80 and a sister who is still alive at 85.  Following a court hearing after the death of his mother, Freddie was sent to an industrial school in Killarney, where he remained until he was transferred to Artane in 1931.  Freddie died in Artane in 1934.  His death certificate stated that he died of influenza and heart failure after entering the infirmary.  Children resident in Artane at the time said Freddie entered the infirmary following a beating and never came out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Freddie&rsquo;s father had a tombstone erected on his original grave in Artane, but during development in the grounds of Artane years later the bodies of the young boys and the brothers were removed.  The bodies of the brothers were interred and identified with headstones but the bodies of the boys who were buried in a mass grave &mdash; their names only recorded on a wall in the chapel &mdash; were never found.  Freddie&rsquo;s family have done their utmost to locate Freddie&rsquo;s resting place so they can give a proper identification and bury him alongside his parents and brother in Mount Jerome.  They are also requesting that an inquiry take place into the deaths of all children who died in the care of religious institutions and that their bodies be exhumed and returned to their families.  There should be a proper burial place for children who may not be claimed.  Each child should have an individual gravestone in a recognised cemetery, away from the industrial school in which they were abused, and appropriate engraving on the tombstone should be erected for each child.</P>
        <P>I can only imagine what it must be like not to have a place of rest where family members can visit and sit and reflect on the lives of loved ones who have passed.  The need to have a place of rest to visit is well documented by counsellors and psychologists as very much part of the healing process of any family bereavement.  Arrangements should be made to assist family members in visiting the burial places of their loved ones.</P>
        <P>It is time for the Government to give a commitment to the relatives that justice will be done, not only for those who have lived through this nightmare, but also for those children who have died during the darkest time in the history of our country.  These children may be gone, but they are not forgotten, especially by the families, friends and relatives.</P>
        <P>For Freddie&rsquo;s family and for many other families, the need is now for closure.  These families have waited for a long time to have their voice heard, and at last this has happened.  As Members of this House, we owe them.  These should be the first steps taken to heal the many broken hearts of those who were abused and those who have died, and to give some comfort and consolation to the family members who are left.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week this House debated possibly one of the most shocking and grave reports ever published in the history of the State.  In their contributions, Deputies from all sides expressed with deep sincerity and often emotive terms the terrible regret, shame, sadness and outrage evoked by the horrors committed in residential institutions, which have now been laid bare by the Ryan report.  The House spoke with one voice, unequivocally, expressing our nation&rsquo;s deep shame at the horrendous abuse perpetrated by people in our society who were entrusted with the care and protection of so many vulnerable children.  We humbly acknowledged both <Col N="311"/>society&rsquo;s and the State&rsquo;s failure to protect our children, and with a deep-seated determination said that society must face up to what happened and ensure it can never be repeated again.  That is the express will of this House and it is now incumbent on us to do everything in our power to help those who suffered so much.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the interests of clarity and for the benefit of the House, I propose to outline the manner in which the State&rsquo;s exhumation process operates.  The role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on acceding to requests to have the remains of deceased persons, including children such as in this specific case, is limited to acting under Section 47 (2) of the Coroners Act 1962, where a death may have occurred in suspicious circumstances.  The relevant statutory provisions state that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is empowered under section 47(2) of the Coroners Act 1962 to issue an exhumation order when requested by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the relevant coroner.</P>
        <P>The legislation states that where a coroner is informed by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not below the rank of inspector that, in his opinion, the death of any person whose body has been buried in the coroner&rsquo;s district may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner, the coroner may request the Minister to order the exhumation of the body by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On being requested under this section to authorise by order the exhumation of any body, the Minister may either make or refuse to make the order.  Having regard to the Coroner&rsquo;s Act as outlined above, the Minister under law can only make a decision on whether an exhumation order is necessary and warranted based on the advice of the coroner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>It is understandable, especially in light of the Ryan report&rsquo;s findings, that many families will now be anxious to establish the circumstances in which their relatives died or to have them re-interred in family plots.  The Garda Commissioner has appointed an assistant commissioner to examine the Ryan report from the perspective of the commission of any criminal offence which may arise from it.  This examination is underway and I urge anybody wishing to report information relating to the commission of a criminal offence arising from the report to do so by contacting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without further delay.</P>
        <P>However, if it is a case that relatives of those children and young adults who died in institutions wish to have them re-interred in family plots and an exhumation order is required for that purpose, then this is granted by the relevant local authority.  The relevant legislation here is the section 46 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948  and it is within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The Government is working with the representatives of survivors to implement the Ryan report&rsquo;s recommendations relating to them.  As stated by the Taoiseach last week, the Government will have before it a plan for implementing all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations by the end of July.</P>

      <sTitle>Anti-Social Behaviour.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Anti-social behaviour has become the scourge of many of our communities, and many people in this country are now afraid to leave their homes, for fear of being harassed or intimidated.  In some cases, life has become so unbearable that local authority housing lists are swamped with applications from people who are looking for housing transfers to escape the torment.  One elderly woman who visited my constituency office was crying.  She was afraid to leave her home because eggs and stones were fired at her house and souped-up cars are driving around her estate at night.  She is not alone; many more are living in the same hell.</P><Col N="312"/>
        <P Just="Left">All incidents of anti-social behaviour are totally unacceptable.  However, in recent times there have been more sinister developments, fuelled by the growing drug culture.  Prior to 2001, the drug problem in this country was confined to Dublin and the larger cities.  From 2001 to 2006, according to figures released by the Health Research Board, the number of drug users seeking treatment for the first time in the west increased by 100%.  During the past 12 months there has been a significant increase in drug dealing in my county, Clare.  Heroin is available mainly in urban areas and cocaine and cannabis are freely available on our streets.  The major growth in the drugs business has been a by-product of the Celtic tiger, when we witnessed the explosion in the use of the so-called recreational drugs, supported by the culture of some celebrities who glamorised the use of these drugs.  What these people must realise is that they are fuelling the demand and supporting drug gangs in the country.  Real people in our communities are living with the consequences of this every day.</P>
        <P>Last weekend, in one of the oldest parts of the town of Ennis, in the early hours of Saturday, a sinister incident occurred.  A grenade was thrown into a house in Cloughleigh estate.  Ten families were evacuated from their homes as a precaution.  The Army disposal unit was called in but, thankfully, the grenade was faulty and did not detonate.  Some 99% of the community in the area are decent, hard-working people trying to get on with their lives.  They do not deserve this.  They are shocked and worried and live in great fear that lives will be lost if these incidents are not stamped out.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge and commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Ennis, under the command of Superintendent John Scanlon, for their efforts and their fast response on Saturday morning, and for their work in trying to deal with the increase of crime in this area.  I am anxious to ensure that a lack of resources does not hamper the Garda effort.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the extra resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Ennis.</P>
        <P>I want a clear commitment on the future of rural Garda stations.  Any decisions to close rural Garda stations will put a further drain on urban Garda stations and we will see fewer garda&iacute; on the beat.  An increased visible presence on the street and more regular patrols in areas such as Cloughleigh is vital in the battle against this senseless violence.  The CCTV system in Ennis needs to be expanded and necessary funding must be made available to make this fully operational.  This would give comfort to people living there.</P>
        <P>Tackling anti-social behaviour is a major problem but one immediate step to be taken is a review of the vetting system for housing applicants.  While local authorities can vet applicants for housing, there is no legislation for the HSE to vet applicants for rent supplement.  This anomaly must be addressed.  Tomorrow morning, I will address a public meeting in Ennis, where there will be an opportunity for the wider community to show its solidarity with the people of Cloughleigh.  We must work together to stamp out this malice not just in this estate in Ennis or another part of Clare, but in every town and village affected.  For the benefit of the entire society, it is time to take a tougher approach to anti-social behaviour.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is best equipped to handle this crisis.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that no obstacles are put in the way of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that resources are made available so that it can get on with the job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot be present but I assure the Deputy that the Minister shares his concern about incidents of anti-social behaviour in Ennis and is conscious of how distressing such incidents are for the local community.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation <Col N="313"/>of such incidents has resulted in a number of arrests.  The persons arrested have been charged with a number of offences including assault, criminal damage and violent disorder.</P>
        <P>Ennis town is patrolled on a 24-hour basis by Garda personnel attached to Ennis Garda station.  Regular patrols are conducted, under the direction of local Garda management, by personnel on mobile, foot and mountain bike duties supplemented as required by personnel attached to the divisional traffic corps and drugs unit, the detective branch and a dedicated community policing unit.  Additional personnel are also available from other Garda districts within the division if required.</P>
        <P>The Minister is informed by the Garda Commissioner that at the end of May the personnel strength of the Clare Garda division was 334.  The strength of the Ennis Garda district was 215, with 131 members based in Ennis Garda station.  The divisional strength is augmented by the resources available to regional and national units, such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Garda national drugs unit and CAB, when required.</P>
        <P>A policing initiative targeting public disorder, minor assaults and other anti-social type behaviour has been put in place in Ennis, with particular emphasis on weekends.  This initiative has been enhanced by the recent introduction of a Garda CCTV system in the town centre.  Other initiatives are regularly put in place targeting under age drinking and ensuring the enforcement of liquor licensing legislation.  These include covert and overt policing measures, which assist in the prevention and detection of anti-social offences.</P>
        <P>Incidents relating to public disorder and other anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the subject of investigation and can be dealt with by way of adult or juvenile caution, a fixed charge penalty notice or by the initiation of criminal proceedings.  As a result, there are a number of individuals currently before the courts for alleged public order and anti-social behaviour in the town.  The Minister is informed that local Garda management is satisfied with the level of service being provided to the community in the Ennis Garda district.  Resource levels are constantly monitored in conjunction with crime trends and other demands made on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are kept under review to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The situation is kept under review by the Commissioner and his senior management and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the area will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are aware of the damage and distress that anti-social behaviour causes communities.  The Garda policing plan for 2009 reflects the priorities set for the force by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  One of the strategic goals identified in the plan is to reduce significantly the incidence of public disorder and anti-social behaviour in communities.</P>
        <P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 brought into force additional legislation to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  In January 2007, behaviour warnings and civil orders were introduced for adults and in March 2007 behaviour warnings, good behaviour contracts and behaviour orders were introduced for children.</P>
        <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle the misuse of alcohol.  The Act places restrictions on the availability and visibility of alcohol and provides for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse.  Garda&iacute; may seize any bottle or container from a person under the age of 18 years that a Garda suspects contains alcohol to be consumed by a person under 18 in a public place.  They may also seize <Col N="314"/>bottles or containers containing alcohol where there is a reasonable apprehension of public disorder or damage to property and may require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner.  The Act also allows for the issue of fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place, which are offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Garda authorities will continue to attach the highest priority to tackling anti-social behaviour.  Legislative provisions dealing with anti-social behaviour are kept under review by the Department.</P>

      <sTitle>Inquiry into Child Abuse.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the Department of Education and Science open a book of condolence in that Department for the victims of child abuse.  I am putting this request on the record because it was made to me by quite a number of victims of child abuse recently.</P>
        <P>Virtually all the children in the reformatories, industrial schools and Marlborough House, which the Department of Education was directly responsible for, were of school-going age.  The Department had a statutory responsibility to fund, inspect and supervise the welfare and education of those children while they remained in those institutions up to when they were 16.  It was negligent over the decades and failed to do what it was statutorily obliged to in protecting the well-being and welfare of the children and care for their needs in those institutions.  The Department allowed the needs of the institutions to be put before the needs of the children and consequently the educational provision and attainment, along with the well-being of these children, was &ldquo;deplorable&rdquo;, according to the Ryan report.</P>
        <P>One can pick any of the conclusions to give an indication of the dreadful operations in these institutions which were ostensibly and statutorily under the care of the Department of Education.  Chapter 6.01 of volume IV states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Physical and emotional abuse and neglect were features of the institutions.  Sexual abuse occurred in many of them, particularly boys&rsquo; institutions.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Chapter 19.06 of volume III states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">More than 90% of all witnesses reported being physically abused while in out-of-home care.  In addition to being hit and beaten witnesses described other forms of abuse such as being flogged, kicked and otherwise physically assaulted, scalded, burned and held under water.  Witnesses reported being beaten publicly in front of other staff, residents, patients and pupils as well as in private.  Many reports were heard of witnesses being beaten naked and partially clothed, both in private and in front of others.  They reported being beaten and physically assaulted with implements that were for the specific purpose of inflicting pain and punishment, such as leather straps, bamboo canes and wooden sticks.  In addition, witnesses gave evidence that everyday implements were routinely utilised for the purpose of striking children.  Witnesses described pervasive abuse as part of their daily lives.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is an example of the regime which operated in 216 institutions throughout the country, mainly industrial schools and reformatories, which were under the aegis of the Department of Education.  It had the responsibility to finance, inspect and supervise the facilities and it had responsibility for the 165,000 children of the nation put under care in them.  The Department was grossly negligent of them.</P><Col N="315"/>
        <P>The Department of Education was for decades a major obstacle to children and their parents obtaining any redress or satisfaction when they made complaints about the dreadful treatment they experienced in the institutions under its supervision.  Not only did the Department neglect these people but it was also an obstacle to them achieving any redress.</P>
        <P>The Department, which has failed the children entrusted to its care, should as the State institution with the greatest specific responsibility make a symbolic statement or gesture of apology and atonement by opening a book of condolence in its main office on Marlborough Street in Dublin 1.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Costello for putting this matter on the Adjournment this evening.  I apologise as the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, cannot be here to take the matter himself.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1999, the then Taoiseach offered an apology to victims of abuse, during which a range of measures were announced to address or alleviate the effects of child abuse.  These included the establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and a dedicated national counselling service.  Subsequent to this, the Government also established the Residential Institutions Redress Board to provide compensation to victims of institutional abuse and, more recently, the education finance board, which provides education grants to former residents and their families.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The then Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology was an admission that the State had failed in its duties towards children who were removed from their families and who were totally dependent on the State for their most basic of needs.  This apology has been reiterated several times in the weeks following the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse by the current Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  In the D&aacute;il last Friday, the Minister for Education and Science apologised separately and unreservedly for the failings of his own Department during the period under investigation by the commission.</P>
        <P>The Ryan report contains 20 formal recommendations and the first four are placed under the heading &ldquo;To alleviate or otherwise address the effects of the abuse on those who suffered&rdquo;.  One recommendation &mdash; the issue of erecting a memorial to survivors &mdash;  has been the subject of consultations with the Office of Public Works.  It is proposed to hold further discussions with the survivor groups to advance implementation of this recommendation.</P>
        <P>The report also made recommendations relating to education, counselling and family tracing services.  Currently, funding is being provided for education and counselling purposes and Barnardos is being funded to provide a family tracing service for former residents, which is highly valued by them.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, has been asked to bring to Government before the end of July a comprehensive implementation plan to put in place the recommendations on how children should be cared for now and in the future.</P>
        <P>On 3 June, the Taoiseach and members of the Cabinet met with survivors of child abuse and their representatives to begin the process of discussion of the issues arising from the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  During that meeting, the Taoiseach confirmed the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of and commitment to the full implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.  In addition, he conveyed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the needs of survivors and other issues arising from the report in consultation with representatives of survivors of abuse.  This meeting represented the beginning of a process of engagement with the representatives of the survivors.</P>
        <P>A range of issues was raised by the survivor groups during that meeting, which include contributions by the congregations, redress, future needs of the former residents, criminal <Col N="316"/>records, counselling and therapy services and a memorial.  All of these will now be given further consideration by the Government.  The issue raised by the Deputy of opening a book of condolences will be considered in that context and in the course of further engagement with the survivor groups.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and all Members of this House for their unanimous approval of the all-party motion on the Ryan report last week.  I again assure all Members of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the needs of survivors.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if he will introduce a grant support scheme in respect of the upgrading of windows in homes in line with the objectives of the greener homes scheme and the home energy saving scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme, which opened for applications on 25 March, provides grant assistance for a range of energy efficiency applications.  These include roof insulation, as well as specific internal and external wall insulation, and boilers and heating controls.  Grant assistance is also provided for the assessment of energy upgrade requirements, through a Building Energy Rating (BER) rating before and after the remedial works.</P>
        <P>The measures were selected for inclusion in the scheme, with the expert advice of Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and in light of the pilot phase of the scheme last year.</P>
        <P>SEI recommended the measures to my Department as being the most optimum to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners at least cost and as representing best use of budgetary resources.</P>
        <P>Replacement windows are not currently eligible for grant assistance under the scheme.  My Department and SEI are keeping the scheme under constant review and will continue to give consideration to the scope for adding other measures to the scheme, subject to budgetary and technical considerations.  Similar to the Greener Homes Scheme, the Home Energy Savings Scheme will evolve and adapt as it rolls out and as the market for these measures matures.  This may give rise to changes to the measures eligible under the scheme over time.</P>
        <P>To date, there has been very strong interest in taking up grant offers for the existing six measures.  Since the scheme opened less than three months ago, grants worth &euro;16 million, have been offered to 12,000 homeowners nationwide.</P><Col N="318"/>
        <P>There are critical benefits accruing for the construction industry from the Scheme in terms of economic activity, retraining and job retention.  To date, over 2,000 contractors have registered with SEI to install measures under the scheme, with a similar level of BER assessors also being deployed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 12, 17, 46 and 48 together.</P>
        <P>Biofuels have a central role to play in the delivery of reductions in Greenhouse Gas emissions, as one of the few available and effective means of reducing emissions from transport.</P>
        <P>Ireland must meet a challenging 10% renewable energy in transport target by 2020, under the terms of the Renewable Energy Directive.  In that context, the development of a sustainable and robust biofuels supply is critical.</P>
        <P>To date, the most important measures taken to incentivise the use of biofuels in Ireland have been the Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes, which were introduced in 2005 and 2006 on the basis of competitive calls for proposals.  The schemes have resulted in 18 projects being awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010.  Of these projects, four are in the biodiesel category, five are in the pure plant oil category, four are in the bioethanol category and 5 are in the captive fleets category.</P>
        <P>Individual amounts of biofuel produced by particular companies under the schemes is deemed to be commercially sensitive information.  I can advise the Deputy that under the First Scheme, excise relief was awarded on 16m litres of biofuel with over 6.8m litres of biofuel being produced to date.  Under the Second Scheme, excise relief was awarded on 665m litres of biofuel.  Up to the end of December 2008 there has been over 100m litres of biofuel produced.  My Department does not have details of the number of companies that did not receive <Col N="319"/>excise relief under the schemes but which are nonetheless, currently producing biofuel.  No specific licensing is required for biofuel production, and no authorisations are required from my Department in this regard.</P>
        <P>Since the excise relief schemes were introduced there has been a steady increase in biofuels used in Ireland. Prior to the introduction of the schemes, in common with other Member States, market penetration of biofuels in Ireland was almost non existent.  In 2007, penetration had risen to 0.6% and on the basis of the Mineral Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) figures alone, penetration had risen to at least 1.5% in 2008.  On the basis of a 4% penetration rate, the imports of mineral fuels can be expected to fall by around 2.5%.  However, given that biofuels are approximately the same price as mineral fuels, the impact on the Exchequer and the consumer will be minimal in direct financial terms.  Increased indigenous biofuels production will have a positive impact on the Irish economy and security of energy supply and sustainability by displacing imported fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>The schemes were designed as interim measures to accelerate the level of biofuels in the fuel mix, and were put in place in anticipation of the planned introduction of a Biofuels Obligation Scheme in 2010.  A public consultation was undertaken in October 2008, on the parameters of the Biofuels Obligation.  The proposal for a penetration rate of 4% by volume (equating to approximately 3.2% by energy), was generally welcomed in the submissions made.  An increase in penetration rate to 6% in 2012, being dependent on the outcome of a review.  My Department is currently finalising proposals for legislation, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, with a view to the introduction of the Obligation in 2010.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s Biofuels Obligation will integrate the EU Sustainability Criteria, which are currently being finalised.  The objective is to ensure that all biofuels counted towards the national obligation are fully sustainable in line with EU requirements.  While the Ministerial car fleet, including fuel provision, is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, the obligation will ensure that any biofuels used by the State fleets will meet the EU sustainability criteria.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 21 and 49 together.</P>
        <P>The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 2007 provides for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) to licence commercial DTT operators, as a matter of priority.  The BCI is an independent body and I have no role in its licensing process.</P><Col N="320"/>
        <P>The 2007 Act also provides for RT&Eacute; to establish a free to air national DTT service to replace the existing analogue terrestrial services offered by RT&Eacute;, TG4 and TV3, as a matter of priority. There is no requirement on RT&Eacute; to complete this work in 2009.</P>
        <P>In relation to funding, the Act provides that the establishment and operation of the RT&Eacute; national DTT service can be funded from licence fee monies.</P>
        <P>The rollout of DTT infrastructure is well advanced and RT&Eacute;NL has already built a network which includes the main transmitter sites in Ireland.  This represents the central component of their build plan.  The remaining build work will largely involve upgrading the country&rsquo;s minor transmitter sites to provide &ldquo;infill&rdquo; coverage and to ensure that outlying areas in the West, North, North West and South of the country, those areas most reliant on the analogue terrestrial service, are also served by DTT.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the DTT network will be built in time for the switch off of the analogue television services in 2012.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In July 2008 I published a draft paper on Next Generation Broadband, which considered the challenges for the Government in positioning Ireland as a leading country in the provision of broadband infrastructure and in the development of new digital applications.</P>
        <P>There has been an extensive consultation process following the publication on the draft paper.  This involved written submissions on the paper, a one-day Forum held on the 30th September 2008 and an online consultation forum.  The consultation process yielded a wide range of submissions from the industry, policy makers and broadband users.  I am pleased to say that the thrust of the proposals in the draft paper was widely supported.</P>
        <P>The final paper will be published within days and will provide a strong policy framework for the roll out of Next Generation Networks (NGN) as well as outlining specific Government initiatives.  The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) are also to publish a paper very shortly on the regulatory framework for NGNs.  Therefore a robust framework will be in place for prospective investors.</P>
        <P>I must stress that progress is being made on a number of the specific actions set out in the draft paper.  This includes actions such as a one-stop-shop for State infrastructure to facilitate the rollout of fibre to the regions; mandating new fibre to new build where practicable; high speed connectivity to schools and innovative use of frequency spectrum.</P>
        <P>In addition, on foot of the principle that Government will have a direct investment role to play in bridging digital divides, where the market cannot provide solutions, direct Government intervention in the communications sector have continued apace.  These include the agreement and initial roll-out of the National Broadband Scheme, improvement in International Connectivity through Project Kelvin and the substantial completion of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</P>
        <P>As I already stated ComReg will very shortly publish a paper that will deal with the regulatory framework to support rollout of NGN.  In this context<b> </b>it is recognised that the current system needs to be adapted to support investment.  Towards this end, there is a role for collaborative models of engagement in rolling out high speed broadband networks, providing that <Col N="321"/>existing regulatory requirements such as open access and non-discrimination are respected and that the overall competitive dynamic remains.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the level of price reduction consumers can expect from regulated gas prices in September 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) reduced gas tariffs by 12% from May 1st, following completion of the review of regulated tariffs, which I requested in February last.  The Commission&rsquo;s decision on gas tariffs reflects much lower gas costs than forecast, exchange rate developments, and increased sales during the particularly cold winter months.</P>
        <P>This CER pricing decision brought forward price reductions, which would otherwise have to take place in October of this year.  The CER is undertaking its usual annual review of domestic tariffs in the coming weeks informed by a tariff submission from BGE.  The prospect of any further gas price reductions next October will be determined primarily by wholesale gas price trends and gas demand over the coming months.</P>
        <P>The reduction last month in regulated gas prices was less than the overall fall in wholesale prices, because the CER took steps to ensure that when international gas prices increased exponentially in 2008, consumers were not overly exposed to intermittent gas spikes.</P>
        <P>In taking this approach, the CER took account of the emerging difficult economic situation and the potential impact of high price increases on business and consumers, including vulnerable customers.  This approach meant that when fossil fuels were rising very significantly in early and mid-2008 the CER decided to implement an increase of 20% in the cost of gas.  When the CER made this decision, the wholesale gas price had more than doubled in the previous 12 months.</P>
        <P>I would point out that the CER has exited from the regulation of tariffs for large energy users.  In that sector around 88%, in volume terms, of business has switched to the independent gas suppliers.</P>
        <P>For those commercial customers on variable tariffs the substantial reductions in wholesale gas prices are already being reflected in their tariffs.</P>
        <P>It is the case that energy costs have been of concern to enterprise for a number of years.  This concern has been exacerbated by the economic downturn and the overall serious challenges facing business.  I have made it consistently clear that all possible action that can be taken must be taken to reduce energy costs for the enterprise sector.  Energy policy actions are focussed on mitigating those costs where possible. My Department is actively engaged on the energy costs issue with all relevant players, including the CER, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, the independent suppliers and the enterprise sector itself.</P>
        <P>I have no direct role in the setting of gas prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated sector.  My policy objective is to secure sustainable and diverse energy supply at least cost for Irish business and consumers.  The Government&rsquo;s comprehensive range of energy policy actions are designed to deliver this objective.  They include optimising all possible energy efficiency gains by industry and by householders.</P>

	<P>In relation to the first part of the question, an amount of just over &euro;224 million was collected in 2008 in respect of television licences revenue.  This was made up of just over &euro;168 million in respect of direct sales by An Post, &euro;53.7 million paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the issuing of &lsquo;Free Lifetime&rsquo; television licences and an additional &euro;1.9 million for payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of an outstanding issue from 2004 when a new system for calculating monthly payments came into being.<b><i></i></b>As of 31st May of this year, approximately &euro;91 million has been received by my Department in respect of television licence fee revenue.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has also asked for the amount of revenue associated with uncollected TV licences.  By its very nature, monies uncollected are very difficult to estimate.</P>
        <P>My Department monitors the level of sales achieved by An Post and the volumes of sales can indicate the compliance, or otherwise, in this area.  To date in 2009, the level of sales is running more or less on a par with last year.  In the meantime, An Post is endeavouring to reduce the TV licence fee evasion rate on an ongoing basis.  I would also point out to the Deputy that my Department, in negotiating the annual target of sales to be reached by An Post, factors in a 1% increase in the overall licence base as a means of reducing the level of evasion.</P>

	<P>When referring to broadband and broadband take-up the most commonly used indicator is the OECD indicator.  This is the number of broadband subscribers per 100 inhabitants.  The most up to date report includes data as at the end of December 2008.  Ireland, at 20.6, subscribers per 100 inhabitants, is behind the OECD average of 22.6.</P>
        <P>This indicator does not take into account mobile broadband subscriber data.  Ireland had 308,909 mobile broadband subscribers at the end of December 2008.  Year-on-year, mobile broadband subscriptions increased in Ireland by 142%.</P>
        <P>The OECD reporting is lagging behind developments in the market.  Given the capability of mobile broadband to deliver broadband services that compare well with other platforms, the inclusion of mobile broadband subscriber data in OECD reports has been requested by various countries including Ireland.  The OECD is now proposing to publish two indicators, one for wired broadband and another for wireless broadband (to include mobile data).  It is important that advances made in broadband uptake in Ireland are reflected in the international statistics to give the complete picture.</P>
        <P>Counting mobile broadband subscriptions, which the OECD will do in future reports, Ireland&rsquo;s score rises significantly to 27.1, and should be well ahead of the OECD average for future reports.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 26, 29, 44 and 171 together.</P>
        <P>There are currently in excess of 1,400 megawatts (MWS) of renewable powered electricity generating plants accessing the electricity grid.  Wind powered technology is the dominant renewable technology.  There are 92 windfarms connected with a combined capacity in excess of 1,000 MWs compared to hydro-power with 240 MWs approximately connected and a lesser volume of biomass powered plant connected.  The amount of renewable-powered plant connected and accessing the electricity grid is increasing steadily from year to year. It is estimated the available plants contributed 12.2% of all electricity consumed in 2009 compared to 4.4% in 2003.</P>
        <P>There are a further 1400 MWs, approximately, of capacity in additional projects which have received connection offers, which have been accepted into REFIT and are in the process of gaining grid access.  It is estimated that less than 300 MWs of this additional capacity is required to deliver or exceed the Government target to increase the contribution from renewable energy sources to 15% of all electricity consumed by 2010.  The excess beyond 300 MWs will contribute to the subsequent Government target to achieve a 40% contribution by 2020.  In addition, in December 2008, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) issued a decision which requires Eirgrid and ESB Networks to provide connection offers for an additional 3,900 MWs of new capacity to ensure the 2020 target can be achieved.</P>
        <P>The actual completion rate of new renewable-energy powered projects in any future period will be determined by a number of factors including connections completions.  In the case of the Gate 3 connection offers, the forecast delivery dates for connections will be notified in detailed connection offers from Eirgrid and ESB Networks planned for delivery to individual applicants later this year. The subsequent build rate of generation plants in any year will be dependent, in part, on the date of completion of grid reinforcements and connections by Eirgrid and ESB Networks rather than any forecast averaged annualised target for any period.</P>
        <P>Applications for grid connections to permit grid access are made to ESB Networks for projects at or less than 20 MWs. Larger project applications, above 20 MWs, are made to EirGrid.  Supervision of the grid connection process and settlement of any disputes arising is vested in the CER. I have no statutory authority to intervene or to set conditions for connections.  However I understand that the connection process does facilitate changes in details, including changes to the named applicant, on connection applications and offers providing the technical specification of the connection proposed is not materially changed. This flexibility permits changes to project proposals without delaying those projects. Excluding technical changes from the permitted changes protects the expectations of landowners along the planned connection route.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that the benefits of competition in electricity supply, which have previously been confined to large industrial and commercial customers, are finally available to domestic <Col N="325"/>consumers. The entry into the domestic electricity market of two new suppliers, Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is Energy, demonstrates that policy to encourage competition in electricity generation and supply is paying dividends for consumers.</P>
        <P>The independent suppliers are offering discounts of between 10% and 14% on ESB tariffs.  These discounts apply even after the recent 10% reduction to ESB prices implemented by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).</P>
        <P>The independent suppliers are also offering domestic consumers fresh choices, such as the proportion of renewable electricity they purchase, as well as alternative billing arrangements.</P>
        <P>Domestic customers have been switching to the independent suppliers in unprecedented numbers.  However, there are close to 2 million domestic electricity customers and that ESB still retains approximately 90% of the market share.</P>
        <P>The regulation of ESB tariffs will only continue until competition has taken firm hold in the market.  Energy price regulation is designed to ensure that a dominant player cannot engage in uncompetitive, short-term pricing practices, which could undermine or drive out emerging competition.</P>
        <P>The CER will continue to review overall energy tariff structures over the coming months taking account of global fuel prices, the importance of regulatory and market certainty for the energy sector and the competitiveness challenges facing industry.</P>

        <P>Approximately &euro;85 million has been spent to date on Phase l of the MANs Programme and almost &euro;98 million on Phase ll, to date.  These costs include all construction costs, design and associated programme management costs as well as the local authorities&rsquo; contributions of approximately &euro;17 million.  All networks were constructed under a fixed price contract and are co-financed under the European Regional Development Fund.  The cost net of ERDF funding to the State of both Phases of the MANs Programmes is approximately &euro;98 million.</P>
        <P>Future broadband investment decisions, including investment in any further phases of the MANs Programme, will be guided by (i) the policy paper on Next Generation Broadband, which is being finalised at present, (ii) the Value for Money and Policy Review undertaken on Phase I of the MANs Programme and published in July 2008 and (iii) the availability of resources.</P>

	<P>Combined Heat and Power (or CHP) is a set of technologies which allows for both the generation of electricity and the use of heat released from the same process, thereby dramatically increasing the efficiency of the system. As such, CHP can make a valuable contribution to reducing energy costs to industry, and to reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions, particularly if the fuel source used is renewable, as in the case of biomass or biogas released from anaerobic digestion.</P>
        <P>My Department currently has a number of programmes aimed at supporting the use of CHP. Perhaps the single most important of these relates to the CHP Deployment Programme, currently operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland. This programme provides information and support to those investigating the use of CHP of all kinds, including financial support for feasibility studies. Capital support is available to those installing Biomass fired CHP plants, or CHP plants based on Anaerobic Digestion (or AD), or small scale fossil powered CHP plants. Anaerobic Digestion involves the processing of plant or animal by-products in digesters, allowing the material to breakdown and release methane, which can then be burned in a CHP plant.</P>
        <P>Since the capital support element of the CHP Programme opened, 80 applications have been received, with 58 approved to a total commitment value of nearly &euro;5m. Based on all approved projects the installed capacity of the Capital Investment projects will be 14,562 kW of electricity and 19,937 kW thermal &mdash; representing a potential saving of 25,254 tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> per year and annual displaced grid electricity of 77 GWh. The projects installed to date have a combined capacity of nearly 8MW electrical and almost 12MW of thermal energy, and have drawn down over &euro;1.6m in funding. To date 4 grant applications have been made for Biomass CHP, of which 3 were received in the last couple of months. One application has also been received for an AD CHP plant. Of the 4 Biomass applications, 1 has been approved in Co. Cork (to a value of 1.3 million). This project is currently under construction.</P>
        <P>My Department is also in regular contact with the CHP group that exists within IBEC, and directly with the industry, in order to ensure that policy in this regard reflects the needs of industry.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 57 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is giving high priority to supporting the development of Ireland&rsquo;s ocean energy potential.  Not only will ocean energy contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets, it has considerable potential for inward investment and enterprise activity in support of economic renewal.  The ocean energy package launched last year is designed to ensure Ireland is fully positioned to harness the rich potential of the technology.  Delivery will entail close cooperation between Departments, agencies and the industry to deliver on the roadmap, which will transform ocean energy into a commercially viable industry.</P>
        <P>The dedicated Ocean Energy Development Unit (OEDU) was established within Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) last year.  It has since commenced full implementation of the ocean energy programme.  Expenditure in 2008 was &euro;1 million.  The budget for ocean energy developments for 2009, which is the Unit&rsquo;s first full year in operation, is &euro;7m.  It is anticipated that the budget will be fully spent in 2009.</P>
        <P>Ocean energy technologies are still in the research and development phase globally.  It is estimated that there are about 10 megawatts (MWs) of ocean energy test projects installed at this time.  This reflects the early phase of development of the technology within international research programmes.  The Government&rsquo;s target, following suitable technology development, is to install 500 MWs of ocean energy technologies by 2020.  We have also sent a clear signal to the market in the announcement of a feed-in tariff of &euro;220 per megawatt hour for wave and tidal technologies under the REFIT Scheme.</P>
        <P>The ocean energy strategy has already made significant initial progress.  The Unit is open for business and is working with all players in rolling out the key elements of the ocean energy strategy.</P>
        <P>There are already significant expressions of interest by a range of commercial players who wish to conduct R &amp; D into Ireland&rsquo;s ocean energy potential, at the earliest opportunity.  Attracting and retaining world class renewable energy companies to Ireland is key to the successful development of the ocean energy resource.  The economic potential is estimated to be significant by the IDA.</P>
        <P>I am working closely with my colleagues the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to ensure that both the short term and medium term offshore energy licensing and planning issues are satisfactorily addressed.  Clarity and certainty about the licensing regime is critical for industry confidence and to secure their long term commitment to Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Ocean Energy Unit launched the industry prototype development fund towards the end of 2008.  To date, 20 Expressions of Interest leading to seven firm proposals have been submitted by developers.  Of these seven firm proposals for funding, 3 projects are well advanced in the assessment process and the other four proposals are completing technical and business evaluation.  Funding decisions will be made in light of these evaluations.</P><Col N="328"/>
        <P>SEI, in partnership with the Marine Institute and ESBI, has undertaken a detailed assessment process since 2007 to identify the most suitable wave energy test site with a grid connection to the electricity network.  The development partnership will now develop a grid connected site off Annagh, County Mayo.  This facility will test operational pre-commercial wave energy devices directly connected to the electricity network.</P>
        <P>The Project team is completing detailed technical consultation with prospective industrial users of the facility.  It is also completing engineering specifications, onshore and offshore lease applications, network connection and necessary on-shore works.  The project is scheduled to be complete by 2010 subject to external factors including offshore sea conditions during the development phase.</P>
        <P>The Unit is also working with University College Cork (UCC) to upgrade the existing wave-basin located at the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) at UCC.  The facility provides research and testing facilities for a variety of offshore purposes.  The upgrade of the existing facility includes new wave generating equipment, new experimental test rigs, improved workshop facilities and advanced computer solutions for numerical analysis and modelling.  Expenditure in 2009 on the facility is estimated at &euro;1 million.</P>
        <P>In addition, proposals for a new National Ocean Test Facility (NOTF) will be developed by 2012 as part of a proposed Maritime and Energy Research Centre beside the National Maritime College at Ringaskiddy.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that we maintain momentum on all fronts.  The work now under way will reap rich dividends for Ireland if we succeed in building the critical mass of knowledge skills and capability to test and develop the technology and systematically address the short to medium term challenges.</P>

	<P>The Consultation Paper on Next Generation Broadband (NGB), which I launched in July 2008, proposed the establishment of a one-stop-shop to provide service providers with flexible and open-access to existing and future State owned infrastructure suitable for telecoms services.</P>
        <P>Trade over digital networks is becoming increasingly important and access to high speed broadband networks will be necessary if indigenous and foreign owned enterprises in the regions are to prosper in the SMART economy.</P>
        <P>Leveraging publicly owned ducting has the capacity to significantly reduce costs for private sector investors in rolling out fibre to the regions and thereby improve competition in the electronic communications market.</P>
        <P>The one-stop-shop received a largely positive response in the Consultation process on the NGB Paper and contributors recognised the potential of utilising State assets to provide fibre networks, in the regions.</P>
        <P>Following the Consultation process, my officials worked with the relevant State agencies in the energy and transport sectors to compile a data-base of the supply of publicly-owned-infrastructure, which currently or potentially can support high speed broadband networks.</P><Col N="329"/>
        <P>Following this process, maps have been compiled, which provide an indicative depiction of the supply and gaps of relevant State infrastructure.  The maps also include the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), an essential component of broadband connectivity in the regions.  These maps will be published as part of the Next Generation Broadband policy paper, which will be launched shortly.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the readiness of this infrastructure varies greatly between the different agencies.  For example, while some agencies are already involved in the telecom sector, other agencies have no involvement in the sector.</P>
        <P>Another factor to consider is that some publicly-owned infrastructure may be subject to existing contractual arrangements and may not be currently available on an open-access basis.</P>
        <P>The next step on developing the one-stop-shop is to decide on the best operational model and I expect to make a decision in this area over the summer.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 31 and 41 together.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the work carried out by the Climate Change and Energy Security Committee in producing a draft Bill to modernise the planning regime for offshore energy projects.  The Bill proposed by the Committee is providing useful input into an ongoing review of the offshore planning system.  The Government has agreed that the majority of the foreshore functions are to be transferred from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, where they are to be integrated into the onshore planning processes.  This will provide greater clarity and certainty for developers.  While this is a somewhat different route than that proposed by the Committee, a &lsquo;fit for purpose&rsquo; regime for renewables is very much the stated outcome desired by the Committee in its own proposals.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has signalled his intention to modernise the foreshore consent process, and the legislation underpinning it, aimed at providing an accelerated timeline for the grant of leases/licences in order, inter alia, to enable the Government&rsquo;s renewable energy target of 40% by 2020 to be achieved.</P>
        <P>In that context, an overall Marine Spatial Strategy will be developed, which will be facilitated by the Strategic Environmental Assessment of Irish waters for energy development that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is currently initiating through the Ocean Energy Development Unit of Sustainable Energy Ireland, in conjunction with the Marine Institute.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 58 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of institutional supports and investment in improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock.  I am working closely with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to deliver a fully cohesive approach across Government.</P>
        <P>I established, last year, an Inter Departmental/Agency Group led by my Department and the Department for Social and Family Affairs, and which also includes the Departments of Finance, Taoiseach, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Health and Children, the Commission for Energy Regulation, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), ESB and BGE and the Institute of Public Health.  The Group is also liaising with relevant groups and agencies in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>This intensive cooperation and coordinated working by all the relevant Departments, agencies and the utilities is ensuring the effective delivery of a comprehensive approach to addressing energy affordability.</P>
        <P>The most recent research figures available on fuel poverty in Ireland are contained in a recent working paper by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  There are a variety of ways to measure fuel poverty including the proportion of household expenditure on fuel, the condition of the house and the subjective view of occupants about their energy needs.</P>
        <P>The ESRI estimates that using the expenditure method, over 300,000 or 19.4% of Irish households may have experienced fuel poverty in 2008.  Alternatively, using the subjective method, over 68,000 or 4.6% of households reported that they could not afford to heat their homes adequately.  There are many alternative definitions and measurements of fuel poverty.  The Government&rsquo;s own working definition is the inability to afford adequate warmth in a home or the inability to achieve adequate warmth because the home is not energy efficient.  By assisting vulnerable homes through the Warmer Homes Scheme to become more energy efficient, my Department, through SEI, is tackling one of the root causes of fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme is administered by SEI and delivered by community based organisations (CBOs), which work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations, including public health nurses, Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and St Vincent De Paul, to identify and address the energy needs of vulnerable homes.  The scheme provides structural energy efficiency improvements to private homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty.  These measures include insulation, boiler lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting and draft proofing measures.</P>
        <P>To date, energy efficiency improvements in almost 24,000 homes have been made under the Warmer Homes Scheme.  Some &euro;20 million has been provided for the scheme in 2009, which includes &euro;5 million being provided between ESB and BGE.  This will enable structural improvements to be made to at least 15,000 homes this year.  This represents a very significant up-<Col N="331"/>scaling of the Scheme and is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the problems of energy affordability.</P>
        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme is designed to assist non-local authority homes only.  The Fitzpatrick Report published by SEI in 2003 estimated that of those in or at risk of fuel poverty, one third lived in local authority homes.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, together with Local Authorities, provides separate services to upgrade the energy efficiency of social housing.  Over the past four years, that Department has provided some &euro;125 million to support the installation of central heating, and associated thermal insulation measures, in 25,650 local authority dwellings.  A further &euro;14 million has been set aside in 2009 to complete the programme and is expected to deliver improvements in over 2,000 dwellings.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has also set aside some &euro;25 million for 2 initiatives designed to address fuel poverty in local authority dwellings, as well as contributing to the overall improvement in the energy efficiency of local authority stock.  Of this, &euro;20 million has already been allocated to local authorities to improve the energy efficiency of vacant dwellings, or apartment complexes, to a Building Energy rating (BER) standard of C1.  The other &euro;5 million has been set aside to support a number of demonstration projects that will achieve a BER rating in excess of C1 and will inform the future improvement of the overall local authority stock.</P>
        <P>The Fuel Poverty Action Research Project was established by Combat Poverty and SEI to inform the future directions of energy efficiency programmes for vulnerable households.  The project involved a rigorous assessment of the energy, environmental, thermal comfort and health benefits of the Warmer Homes Scheme.  I understand that completion of the report was delayed by the accidental loss of some key interview data.  To ensure the integrity of the analysis, these interviews had to be repeated.  Funding was not a factor in this delay.  Combat Poverty is currently finalising the report and I am informed that it will be published for consultation towards the end of July.</P>

	<P>While the provision of broadband is a matter for the service providers, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In this regard, my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage including the Group Broadband Scheme, the Metropolitan Area Networks Programme and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  These initiatives have been designed to bridge the digital divide, create greater equality in terms of social and economic inclusion and remove the disadvantage caused by a lack of broadband services.</P>
        <P>The most recent initiative aimed at tackling the digital divide is the NBS.  My Department has entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.</P>
        <P>3 is currently planning the construction and rollout of the infrastructure required for the provision of the service.  Challenging roll out targets have been agreed with 3.  Services were launched in a small number of rural areas at the end of April 2009 and the entire NBS area must be covered by September 2010.</P>

	<P>In February 2009 I announced a number of interim measures to encourage the use of microgeneration in Ireland. Among the measures is a guaranteed price of 19 cent per kilowatt hour of electricity produced. This competitive feed-in tariff will apply to the first 4,000 micro-generation installations countrywide over the next three years. Eligible installations include small scale wind, photovoltaic, hydro and combined heat and power. I also announced the Microgeneration Field Trials programme to be run by SEI, which will assess the potential offered by Microgeneration in Ireland, and will also assess any potential barriers to its development.</P>
        <P>This tariff is provided as follows. The Public Electricity Supplier (ESB Customer Supply) will offer an export payment of 9 cents per kWh. This payment will be available to domestic customers of PES. The ESB will provide import/export metering free of charge to the first 4,000 domestic customers installing micro-generators in the next 3 years.</P>
        <P>As an initiative to support micro-generation, ESB will provide an extra support payment of 10 cents per kWh for the first 3,000kWh exported annually.  This payment will be made to the first 4,000 micro-generators connected in the next 3 years and will be paid over a 5 year period.  As part of this package of measures, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) will be running a Small and Micro-Scale Generation Pilot Field Trials Programme.  The overall aim of this pilot programme is to assess the potential for small and micro-scale generators in Ireland and to identify possible barriers, risks and benefits concerned with the deployment of these technologies in Ireland.  Up to 50 sites will be supported under the pilot trial, with an approximately equal mix between Solar Photovoltaic and Wind sites and a number of small and micro-scale hydro sites.</P>
        <P>Importantly, this set of measures are only an initial step.  The output of the Pilot Field Trials Programme, and the experience of ESB Customer Supply, will inform future policy decisions with regard to incentives, infrastructure and those types of Microgeneration units that are most suitable to Irish conditions.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a postcode system.  In this regard, the National Postcode Project Board (NPPB) presented its recommendation in July 2006 as to the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland, the costs and benefits arising from its introduction along with a detailed implementation, promotion and maintenance plan.  The board was assisted by technical and economic consultants, recruited by ComReg, at a cost of approximately &euro;450,000.</P><Col N="335"/>
        <P>The proposal of the NPPB was to proceed with an alpha-numeric postal sector postcode model and that each postcode would have a geo-coordinate at its centre and consequently would be compatible with GPS and other Global Navigation Satellite Systems.  Whilst there are areas of overlap between the two systems, in my view, because of the different uses to which they can be put, satellite technologies will not make postcodes redundant.  Indeed with the launch of the Galileo navigation system in 2011, the demand for postcodes should increase.  This is because applications based on such systems become much more readily accessible to the public through the use of a postcode.</P>
        <P>The report of the board estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of implementing and promoting the postcode would be approximately &euro;15 million.</P>
        <P>The Government decided, in May 2007, that prior to the introduction of postcodes, further analysis to quantify the wider economic and societal benefits should be carried out.  This analysis has incurred total consultancy fees of &euro;54,450.  The resultant report is currently being assessed by my officials with a view to progressing the project and when complete, I expect to bring a further proposal to Government in relation to the introduction of postcodes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 51 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>My Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in late December 2008.  3 is required to provide services to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and who seek a service.</P>
        <P>To this end, challenging programme roll-out targets have been agreed with 3 and initial NBS services were launched in a small number of rural areas at the end of April this year.  Broadband coverage in individual electoral divisions (EDs) will be made available incrementally during the coming months.  The forthcoming availability of services to premises located within identified EDs will be announced progressively prior to their enablement on 3&rsquo;s coverage map which can be accessed on its website at www.three.ie/nbs.</P>
        <P>48% of the EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to be enabled by the end of December 2009, while all of the EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to be enabled by the end of September 2010.  My Department is informed by 3 that these targets will be achieved.  My Department will be intensively monitoring the situation in this regard.</P>
        <P>As regards the exclusion of certain unserved premises from the NBS, it is important to clarify that, in designing the NBS, which was approved by the EU Commission, a balance had to be struck between reaching as many unserved areas as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas.</P>
        <P>EU state aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  The nature of broadband networks is such that they provide a coverage footprint over a certain area rather than an individual link to isolated premises.  It was essential to guard against the NBS coverage footprint spilling over to an extent which would be unacceptable from a state aids perspective, onto surrounding areas already served by existing service providers.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, to try to include individually unserved premises that are located within EDs deemed to be already served within the scope of the NBS would have given rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion and therefore, such areas had to be excluded.</P><Col N="337"/>
        <P>It is expected that over time, as competition increases and technology develops, service providers will be attracted to offer service to any such premises located within currently served areas.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government target refers to a 3% reduction per year on average in greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>The energy sector for which I have policy responsibility will make a leading contribution towards reducing green house gas emissions through a range of measures designed to improve energy efficiency and increase the penetration of renewable energy across the electricity, heat and transport sectors.</P>
        <P>Among the significant energy efficiency initiatives introduced already are the extension of the accelerated capital allowance scheme, which allows companies to write off for tax purposes the full capital cost of certain classes of energy efficient equipment in the year of purchase and the Home Energy Savings Scheme.  The range of tax allowance qualifying energy efficient equipment has been widened in the 2009 Budget to include energy efficient data server systems and on site electricity generation equipment. I am allocating significant resources of &euro;50 million to the Home Energy Saving Scheme, in order to provide grants of up to 40% of the cost of retro-fitting homes. This scheme will increase energy efficiency and lead to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> savings and <Col N="338"/>complements the &euro;20m Warmer Homes Scheme, which provides insulation and energy advice to low income households.</P>
        <P>The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which I published last month, sets out the Government&rsquo;s comprehensive programme of action to be implemented across all sectors to deliver on our national and EU targets for energy efficiency, along with resulting reductions in green house gas emissions. The plan is designed to achieve 20% energy saving across all sectors with 33% savings in public sector, saving &euro;1.6 billion per annum in 2020 in avoided energy costs.</P>
        <P>Further programmes, as set out in the plan in the area of energy efficiency, will be rolled out in the coming years and I expect that these will significantly add to the savings already identified.</P>
        <P>The Government has adopted a target of 40% by 2020 for renewable electricity. The target is underpinned by analysis conducted in the All Island Grid Study, which found that a 40% penetration is technically feasible, subject to upgrading our electricity grid and ensuring the development of flexible generating plant on the electricity system.  The study concluded that achieving this higher level of renewable electricity would reduce our carbon emissions from electricity by 25% over the business-as-usual scenario, a saving of around 5 million tonnes.</P>
        <P>We are also working in collaboration with SEI and ESB on moving to introduce electric vehicles in line with the Government&rsquo;s target of 10% by 2020. I recently announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and ESB and Renault-Nissan, which will create favourable conditions for the introduction of electric vehicles here.</P>
        <P>In the area of biofuels, I published a consultation paper in October 2008 on the introduction of an obligation scheme. This suggested a penetration rate of 4% by volume (equating to approximately 3.2% by energy) for the obligation, and was generally well received. This will be the initial rate for the obligation, with an increase to 6% in 2012 being dependent on the outcome of a review. My Department is currently finalising proposals for Heads of a Bill and I expect the Obligation to come into force in 2010.</P>
        <P>Other energy initiatives funded by my Department and designed to move us towards lower carbon emissions include the major ocean energy research and development programme and Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s heating sector programmes.</P>

	<P>The latest available comparative data from Eurostat, published by Sustainable Energy Ireland in their report &ldquo;Understanding Electricity &amp; Gas Prices in Ireland&rdquo;, which covers the first six months of 2008, shows that for the most common category of small and medium businesses, Irish electricity prices are slightly below the EU average.  However, for larger energy users Irish electricity prices tend to be above the EU average.</P>
        <P>Energy costs have been of concern to enterprise for a number of years.  This concern has been exacerbated by the economic downturn and the overall serious challenges facing business. <Col N="339"/> I have made it consistently clear that all possible action that can be taken must be taken to reduce energy costs for the enterprise sector.  Energy policy actions are focussed on mitigating those costs where possible.</P>
        <P>My Department is actively engaged on the energy costs issue with all relevant players, including the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), ESB, the independent suppliers and the enterprise sector itself.</P>
        <P>Already, all electricity users are benefitting from a reduction in electricity tariffs of 10% from May 1st, following completion of the review of regulated tariffs, which I requested in February last.  In addition, since January 1st all electricity users are benefitting from nearly &euro;400 million in rebates from ESB which have further lowered electricity costs to business.  Electricity prices for large energy users in the enterprise sector are not subject to regulation and benefit from competition in this area.  Many of these enterprises have seen substantial reductions in electricity prices in recent months due to the fall in gas prices.</P>
        <P>Energy support programmes, offered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), are proving very successful in helping businesses reduce their energy usage and hence their costs.  The activity is proving that quite significant savings are achievable, even among firms that have been active in energy efficiency for some time.  Many firms are making significant gains and Irish industry is developing an international reputation for its efficiency activity.</P>
        <P>Long run data from the Large Industry Energy Network shows that firms that have engaged with SEI over several years have on average made efficiency gains of 33% beyond what otherwise would have been achieved.  This is a very significant saving, and each year the data is re-confirming that more cost savings can still be delivered.</P>
        <P>There is also active competition between electricity suppliers in the SME market and companies can avail of discounts of up to 10% &mdash; 20% simply by switching suppliers. Already approximately 60% of SMEs have made this switch and are experiencing the benefits.</P>
        <P>While I have no direct role in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated sector, my objective is to secure sustainable and diverse energy supply at least cost for Irish business and consumers.  The Government&rsquo;s comprehensive range of energy policy actions are designed to deliver this objective.</P>
        <P>These actions include but are not limited to delivering competition and consumer choice through continuing the market liberalisation process.  In doing so we will ensure that the regulatory framework can meet the evolving energy policy challenges and focus, in particular, on creating jobs, growth and innovation in the energy sector.  These actions are essential to delivering an energy sector that provides a reliable and competitively priced energy supply in support of economic renewal and competitiveness.</P>

	<P>The Government has no plans to privatise the ESB.  The Government&rsquo;s policy in relation to the ownership of the electricity transmission and distributions networks is clearly set out in the Energy Policy White Paper and reaffirmed in the Programme for Government.  It is the <Col N="340"/>Government&rsquo;s explicit position that the transmission and distribution network assets will remain in State ownership in perpetuity as strategic national assets.</P>
        <P>The decision to transfer the transmission assets to EirGrid, as the State-owned independent transmission system operator, is fully in line with that position and also reflects EU policy on transmission unbundling.  Implementation of the transmission assets decision will be progressed in a way that ensures the strategic future of both EirGrid and ESB as strong viable Semi State entities, as well as reflecting the position of the State and the ESOT as shareholders and the interests of the energy sector and energy consumers.</P>
        <P>The transfer of the transmission assets involves the resolution of complex technical, financial and operational issues as well as legislation.  I have consistently underlined the need for transparent and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders in the process of implementing Government policy in relation to the transfer of the electricity transmission assets.  I have already announced the commissioning of an independent analysis of the transmission transfer, including costs, benefits and regulatory impact assessment, set in the context also of EU developments and the all island single electricity market.</P>
        <P>Input to the process of independent analysis will accordingly be invited from the direct key stakeholders.  These are the management and unions of ESB and EirGrid, the ESB Employee Share Ownership Trust, as well as the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Department of Finance.  All the direct stakeholders have pivotal roles to play in the process of engagement and analysis and in achieving outcomes that are best for EirGrid and ESB, which are satisfactory for all parties concerned, and which are in the best interests of the economy and consumers.</P>
        <P>I will announce the appointment of the senior independent chair of the process before the end of June with a view to getting the collective process of engagement and analysis under way.  The timing and content of the legislation required to underpin the transfer of the transmission assets will be informed by the process, which it is intended to conclude early next year.</P>

	<P>In designing the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which was approved by the EU Commission, my Department needed to strike a balance between reaching as many unserved premises as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas, thereby minimising market distortion in accordance with EU State Aid rules.</P>
        <P>The NBS will be rolled out on an electoral division (ED) basis, which are the smallest administrative areas used for statistical purposes in the country.  In adopting the ED model my Department was faced with a further decision to determine which EDs should be addressed by the NBS.  This decision was made based on levels of the existing combined broadband coverage in relevant EDs.  Where an ED is completely unserved by any existing service provider it is included in the NBS.  Where it is substantially covered by existing service providers it is <Col N="341"/>excluded from the NBS.  Where an ED is not substantially covered by existing service providers, it will be addressed by the Scheme.  In this regard EU State Aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas that are already substantially served by broadband.  While recognising that some premises within substantially served areas may have difficulties for a variety of reasons in receiving a broadband service, the NBS cannot cater for such limited instances as to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</P>
        <P>It is expected that over time, as competition increases, service providers will be attracted to offer service to unserved premises in these areas. It is also expected that technology innovations e.g. improved satellite broadband services, will result in increased competition in these areas.</P>

	<P>Following on from the 2009 Budget Day announcement on 14th October 2008 on the rationalisation of State agencies, the Government has now formally approved proposals for the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector, which include the creation of a single strengthened national inland fisheries authority to be known as Inland Fisheries Ireland.  This authority will replace the existing Central and seven Regional Fisheries Boards.</P>
        <P>Given the nature of its work the new authority will of course continue to have a strong regional presence.</P>
        <P>A restructuring implementation group, which includes representatives of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, has been established and will help develop the key features and structures of the model.</P>
        <P>Primary legislation is required to bring about this restructuring and in this regard a draft Heads of Bill has recently been approved by Government.  It is expected that the legislation will be published in late summer, be progressed through the Oireachtas later this year and that the new authority will be in place before the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>The terms and conditions of employment of the staff of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, including the current Chief Executive Officers, will not be any less favourable than those currently obtaining and indeed staff will be afforded specific statutory protection in this case.</P>

	<P>The primary role of the Government in the development of the electronic communications market is to formulate regulatory and infrastructural policies to facilitate the provision of high quality services by competing private sector service providers.  This policy approach has facilitated sustained take up of broadband across all platforms in recent years.  With increased cable and mobile subscribers in particular, Ireland had over 1.2 million broadband subscribers at the end of last year.  Over 62% of Irish households had a broadband connection and most of those are now using higher speed connections as increasing competition between the platforms continues to have a very positive effect.  SMEs are also increasing their take up of broadband connections to the extent that the latest figures published by the Central Statistics Office in May 2009 shows that 83% of SMEs had a broadband connection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Currently, 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas requirements are met by imports from the British wholesale gas market via two interconnectors with Scotland.  The remainder comes from storage and the Kinsale Field, which is in decline.  The coming on stream of gas from the Corrib Gas Field will critically alleviate Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imports for its period of production.  The field has the potential to supply 60% of annual demand, and 40% of peak demand, for at least five years.  Throughout, the capacity to import gas from the British market through the two interconnectors will remain.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has statutory responsibility for monitoring and ensuring security of natural gas supply.  The CER is also required to produce an annual Gas Capacity Statement. This Statement provides a seven year rolling forecast of customer demand, network capacity and gas flows, in light of which the adequacy of Ireland&rsquo;s gas transmission system is analysed.</P>
        <P>The 2009 Gas Capacity Statement is currently being prepared and includes a range of possible scenarios regarding differing supply and demand levels. One such scenario is that of a post 2010 date for gas coming ashore from the Corrib field.  The network modelling analysis indicates that the existing transmission systems have sufficient capacity to meet current demand and to cope with the Corrib project not coming on stream until 2011.  In this low supply case it is also assumed that there are no other new supplies into the system so that, once the flows from Kinsale cease in 2013/14, the rest of the system demand has to be met by gas supplied from the UK at Moffat.  The analysis shows that there will be sufficient capacity at Moffat to meet the demand up until 2014 but measures may be needed to increase capacity after that time if Corrib or other new supply sources are not available.</P>
        <P>As regards the availability of gas commodity, it should be noted that Bord G&aacute;is Energy Supply is obliged to purchase gas in advance so as to ensure that the demand of domestic and SME customers is met.</P><Col N="343"/>
        <P>The ongoing difficulties between Russia and Ukraine, which has potential implications for European gas supply, underlines the strategic imperative to diversify Ireland&rsquo;s sources of gas supply and the crucial importance of bringing the Corrib Gas Field into production.  It also underlines that for Ireland, as for all Member States, a coordinated EU approach to security of gas supply is essential.</P>

	<P>I published &ldquo;Maximising Ireland&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency &mdash; The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2009&ndash;2020&rdquo; on 8 May 2009.  The purpose of this Action Plan is to identify those policies and measures that have the potential to contribute towards the Government&rsquo;s national energy efficiency target of 20% energy savings across the economy by 2020.  The Plan sets out details of 90 actions that Government is either taking now or is planning to implement in the next year or two to reach our target.  These are concrete actions adopted by Government and not recommendations.</P>
        <P>The Action Plan sets out in Chapter 12 a timetable for all 90 actions.  This indicates that some 81 of the 90 actions in the Plan are either already being implemented or their implementation will commence no later than 2009.</P>
        <P>According to Sustainable Energy Ireland&rsquo;s (SEI) recently published 2009 report &ldquo;Energy Efficiency in Ireland&rdquo;, energy usage in the services sector has been growing in recent years, increasing by 53% between 1995 and 2007.  This reflects the increasing importance of this sector in the Irish economy and the growth in enterprise in the area.  By contrast, the energy intensity of the services sector decreased by 31% over the same period, a positive development indicating the increased added value in the sector.  This improvement in the energy intensity of the services sector would have been even greater, but for the intensity of electricity use which increased over the period.</P>
        <P>Electricity use per employee was 27% higher in 2007 than in 1995.  By contrast, fuel consumption per employee decreased by 38% over the period.  These figures suggest that growth in energy use in the services sector has in recent years been primarily led by growth in electricity usage.  This is probably explained by increased use of office equipment, computers, servers and related equipment, as well as traditional high electricity usage functions such as lighting.  This makes electricity usage in the services sector of increasing importance to Government in designing its energy efficiency programmes for business.</P>
        <P>I have made available some &euro;4 million to SEI in 2009 for energy advice and support services for the business and public sectors.  A further &euro;6.5 million is also available for grant aid to specific energy efficiency projects in the business and public sectors.</P>
        <P>SEI has placed a particular emphasis on the services sector in the expansion of its advice and support programmes for business and in particular to SMEs.  In the past year, SEI has provided direct advice and support to over 1,000 firms, the majority of these in the services sector.</P>
        <P>SEI is also focusing on the key energy using technologies in the sector, for example ICT and lighting and has conducted nationwide road shows to showcase energy savings available to business from using lighting more efficiently and using more efficient lighting.</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>SEI will continue to expand its work with the services sector, both private and public, to drive efficiency gains and build on the successes to date.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the data currently available on the amounts of VAT generated in 2009 on petrol and auto-diesel relate to the first five months of the year, i.e. January to May inclusive.  The amounts of revenue generated through VAT on petrol and auto-diesel for the period 1 January to 31 May 2009, and for the corresponding periods in 2006, 2007 and 2008, are set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>The decrease in yields to date in 2009 compared to 2008 arise mainly from the reduction in the prices of petrol and especially of auto-diesel this year to date compared to 2008, and weaker economic activity.</P>

	<P>The cycle to work scheme came into operation on 1 January 2009.  With a view to keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers, and following the model of the related travel pass scheme, there is no notification procedure for employers to indicate to the Revenue Commissioners that they are operating the cycle to work scheme.  In view of this, the Revenue Commissioners do not have statistics on the uptake of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The scheme operates on a self-administration basis, with the employer having no obligation to obtain advance approval for a particular scheme, or in fact to notify Revenue that they are operating a scheme, and therefore relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation.</P>
        <P>The purchase of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers for employees or directors is subject to the normal Revenue audit procedure with the normal obligations on employers to maintain records (e.g. delivery dockets, invoices, payments details, etc.).  The employer is also obliged to keep all salary sacrifice agreements entered into between the employer and employees/directors, together with all signed statements from employees/directors regarding use of the bicycles and safety equipment.</P>
        <P>A circular providing for the implementation of the cycle to work scheme in the Civil Service was issued on 27 May 2009.  That circular will also provide a framework for the implementation of the scheme in the wider public service.  The circular is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.finance.gov.ie.</i></P>

        <P>While, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, Revenue cannot comment on the tax affairs of individual charities, they have advised me that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the initial application for charitable tax exemption by each charitable body meets the necessary criteria for such exemption.  Revenue has also confirmed that bodies that are granted charitable tax exemption are subject to periodic risk-focused review towards ensuring that the terms of the exemption continue to be fulfilled.  All relevant matters are taken into consideration in the context of such reviews.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Pre-School year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), which was announced recently by the Minister of Finance.</P>
        <P>The Childcare Directorate of my Office recently wrote to almost 5,000 pre-school service providers in the State, inviting them to participate in the new scheme.  These included pre-school service providers who are notified to the Health Service Executive (HSE) or registered with the Irish Montessori Education Board (IMEB) as a number of other persons who have expressed an interest in establishing a pre-school service and participating in the scheme.  Application forms and other relevant information regarding the scheme were included with this correspondence and these are now being returned by services to their local city or county child care committees, with a closing date for response of 10 July 2009.  The first tranche of application forms is expected to be processed by the child care committees and returned to the Childcare Directorate in my Office on 26 June 2009.  As a result, it is not possible to advise the Deputy at this point in regard to the number of providers who have applied to date or the number of places which they will provide and whether these will be in Dublin or outside of the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>An annual capitation fee of over &euro;2,400 will be paid to participating services in return for the provision of a free pre-school year to each child.  This is equivalent to approximately &euro;276 per month where a service is participating for 38 weeks and approximately &euro;207 per month where it participates for 50 weeks.  The capitation fee and its application on a weekly basis are considered reasonable.  Approximately 1,000 community child care services, most of which are expected to apply for entry into the new scheme, already participate in the Community Child<Col N="348"/>care Subvention Scheme (CCSS).  The average fee charged for a sessional pre-school place in these services is &euro;50 per week.  The ECCE capitation fee also compares very favourably to that paid to private and voluntary pre-school services under the Pre-School Programme Expansion Scheme operated in Northern Ireland which amounts to approximately &pound;30 per week.</P>

	<P>Under the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP), there are four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres.  These centres were designated by the HSE following a recommendation from the advisory group set up under the NCCP.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate. </P>
        <P>The transfer of breast cancer diagnosis and surgery into eight designated cancer centres is almost complete with only three hospitals, Tallaght, Sligo and South Infirmary, still awaiting the transfer of these services to a designated centre.  The NCCP has at all times stated that it only transfers services when it is satisfied that adequate resources are in place.  Services will transfer from Tallaght and Sligo within the next few months.  The NCCP has set aside funding of &euro;5 million from its capital allocation in 2009 to further support and develop the Cork University Hospital Cancer Centre (CUHCC).  Services from South Infirmary will transfer to CUH when the refurbishment project is completed.  Discussions are ongoing with each hospital in regard to the transfer.</P>
        <P>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) initiated a quality review of symptomatic breast cancer services in 2008.  The overall objective of the review was to assess the performance of the designated cancer centres against the National Quality Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services and assist in devising an implementation plan for incremental progress to becoming specialist cancer centres by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>There are a number of phases in the process of meeting the entire range of standards involved.  The first was a self-assessment completed and submitted by each individual hospital in Spring, 2008.  The second phase involved an independent validation by HIQA, in October 2008, of the spring self-assessment process.  In January 2009, HIQA issued individual interim reports to each of the designated centres.  These were based on data from the self-assessments carried out in spring 2008 and were not an inspection of the status of the centres in October, 2008.  The interim reports were copied to the CEO of the HSE, the Secretary General of my <Col N="349"/>Department and to the Interim Director of the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) in January 2009.</P>
        <P>The interim reports provide the centres with details of the standards that are being met and of where gaps exist. Significant progress has been made by all of the designated cancer centres in addressing the gaps in systems and services.  There is ongoing liaison also between the NCCP and HIQA about compliance with the standards.</P>
        <P>The individual hospitals have prepared implementation plans in conjunction with the NCCP, which are now being implemented and monitored by the NCCP.  A further inspection and assessment by HIQA is planned for the end of 2009, and these reports will be published.</P>

	<P>The land at Grangegorman has not been sold and, therefore, the issue of reinvestment of the proceeds of the sale of the lands does not arise.  Rather the Government decided the Grangegorman Development Agency should be charged with developing both educational and health facilities (including mental health facilities) on the site.  While the Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005 made provision for the future vesting of lands at Grangegorman with the agency, no transfer has taken place to date and ownership of the lands remains with the HSE.  The HSE, which is represented on the Grangegorman Development Agency, has been working closely with the agency in planning the provision of health facilities in the context of an overall masterplan for the site.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 82 and 92 together.</P>
        <P>The process on this matter has been on-going for many months now and the dialogue with the Vietnamese Authorities is continuing.  Many Deputies have sought guarantees and specific <Col N="351"/>timeframes for the conclusion of a new agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  I must reiterate my previous remarks on this point.</P>
        <P>At this juncture, all options, including an interim inter-country adoption agreement, are actively being pursued by the Government to allow for the conclusion of discussions on a strengthened bilateral agreement and to facilitate continuity of the strong and positive relationship between both jurisdictions.  It is not possible for me to either give a timetable or anticipate when discussions on the agreement will be finalised.  Discussions on a new bilateral agreement remain live and the request regarding the negotiation of an interim arrangement has been made. It is now a matter for the Vietnamese authorities and, as such, it would be improper for the Government to seek to influence or interfere with this decision-making process.  My officials are in constant contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and with the Embassy on the ground in Hanoi.  As late as last Friday, my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs was in direct contact with the Vietnamese authorities regarding the matter.</P>
        <P>I was informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs on Friday last that Helping Hands Mediation Agency&rsquo;s mediation licence has been revoked.  The Government had requested that the mediation licence for Helping Hands be suspended rather than revoked in light of ongoing discussions on a bilateral agreement.  In the absence of an inter-country adoption agreement, the Vietnamese Government was not in a position to make any exception to the granting of a licence to Helping Hands.  As a consequence, 20 applications, which are currently in Hanoi, will be returned to the applicants.  These applicants were not given referrals before the 1 May deadline.  This is obviously disappointing news for all concerned.  I advised the representative groups on this development on Friday last.  The families involved have also been contacted by the Helping Hands Mediation Agency.  The reinstatement of the Helping Hands licence is necessary to facilitate adoptions from Vietnam.  The Irish Government is actively trying to establish the status of the request for an interim agreement and the associated licensing requirements.</P>
        <P>Despite this development, I must emphasise that all families who have already received a referral in respect of a child from Vietnam will continue to have their application processed to conclusion and will be supported by the Helping Hands Meditation Agency in that process.</P>
        <P>I realise that the pending D&aacute;il summer recess is causing concern with fears being expressed that Government business will be suspended until the D&aacute;il reconvenes in late September.  This is not the case. I have already advised all of the interested parties of my willingness to travel to Hanoi to support the successful conclusion of these discussions, if that is deemed appropriate.  That remains the position.  The uncertainty surrounding this process has caused stress and anxiety to applicants/prospective adoptive parents.  This is something I am acutely aware of and any information that comes to hand continues to be shared without delay.</P>
        <P>I remain completely committed to concluding discussions on the text of the bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  I have explained the reasons for the renegotiation of the existing agreement.  My policy objective is the protection of children.  I want to provide the best possible assurances around international adoption and to improve standards for children and the families who apply to adopt from abroad.  This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.</P>

	<P>A public health alert was received from the World Health Organisation on 24 April 2009 indicating that human cases of influenza type A(H1N1) had been identified in the USA and Mexico.  At that time the WHO pandemic alert level was at phase 3.  On 11 June the WHO raised this alert level to phase 6 which in effect declares an influenza pandemic.  Pandemic means that an influenza virus, new to humans, has appeared, is spreading and is causing disease in many parts of the world.  Level 6 means that there is increased and sustained transmission in human population.  The WHO assessed the severity of the current pandemic as moderate. </P>
        <P>My Department and the Health Service Executive have been preparing for some years for the possibility of a pandemic being declared.  On receipt of the alert from WHO my Department activated the National Plan for pandemic influenza which was put in place in January 2007.  The plan was accompanied by a Guidance Report developed by the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group which was further updated in April 2009 and this guidance is currently being followed.  In line with the plan the following governance structures were put in place:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), which manages the health system response to a public health emergency continues to meet as required.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Pandemic Influenza Expert Group (PIEG) is continuing to provide public health and scientific advice on preparedness and control measures to the NPHET.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Inter-Departmental Committee on Pandemic Planning which coordinates the intersectoral response to a potential pandemic meets as required.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />HSE national and regional crisis management teams are meeting regularly to coordinate HSE preparedness and response measures.</P><Col N="353"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />My Department and the HSE participate in regular teleconference meetings with the European Centre for Disease Control, public health officials in other European Member States and the WHO.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The following measures have also been taken:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Enhanced surveillance in hospitals and in the community.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Regular updates for healthcare professionals and the public.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Provision of antiviral drugs to cover 47% of the population, some of which has been distributed through public health departments to facilitate treatment of initial cases.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The HSE, in association with the Department, has finalised advance purchase agreements to procure 7.7m doses of pandemic vaccine.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Frequently Asked Questions are updated daily on my Department&rsquo;s website and that of the HSE.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Travel advise is updated daily on the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Foreign Affairs websites.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A co-ordinated communications strategy is in place which includes regular press briefings.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The requirements for antiviral drugs and antibiotics are kept under regular review by the NPHET in conjunction with the PIEG and I am satisfied that the measures taken to date are sufficient based on current knowledge and guidance.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Adoption Bill, 2009, was published in January of this year. Under the new Bill, there is no specific provision to provide post-adoption services for children and families who have additional needs. Adopted children and their families who have additional needs have, and will continue to have, the same eligibility and entitlements to health, personal social services and special education needs as any family in Ireland.</P>
        <P>However, the Bill does make statutory provision for the notification by adoptive parents of the adoption on return to Ireland with a child. This notification must be made both to the Adoption Authority for the purposes of registering the child as well as to the HSE, so that the child receives all of the normal child health surveillance services available through the public health system.</P>
        <P>Of course, the allocation of resources for services that may be required in such cases is a matter for the HSE.</P>
        <P>I have asked the HSE to collate the data, such that are available, in relation to adoption breakdowns and I will revert to the Deputy directly as soon as the information becomes available.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The professional conduct of the consultant referred to has been the subject of a number of inquiries.  In 1995 the Medical Council instigated a fitness to practice inquiry but this was delayed pending the outcome of separate legal proceedings, including criminal and judicial review proceedings.  Following a Supreme Court judgement in July 2008 the Medical Council recommenced an Inquiry, and on 25 November 2008 the Medical Council formally notified me of its decision to remove the name of the consultant from the Medical Register. The Medical Council made its decision after considering the report of its Fitness to Practise Committee, which found the person concerned guilty of professional misconduct in respect to 3 out of 9 allegations made by male patients.</P>
        <P>In 1995 a review of the Hospital&rsquo;s response to the allegations against the consultant was conducted by an Independent Review Group chaired by Dr. Miriam Hederman O&rsquo;Brien. The Review Group recommended that common written protocols for dealing with allegations of sexual abuse by members of staff be introduced and applied in all health care institutions.  The Trust in Care guidelines, which were published in 2005, deal with the recognition, prevention and management of cases of abuse.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, in line with the Review Group&rsquo;s recommendations, a chaperone system and an intimate examination protocol and procedure has been put in place in the Hospital concerned. The Review Group emphasised the importance of having a complaints system in place to deal with allegations of sexual abuse. A Regional Complaints Policy and Procedure is in place for the former North Eastern Health Board.  Statutory delegated complaints officers are also in place in the Hospital. In addition, a staff support service (Staff Care) is available to all staff in the Hospital on a confidential basis.</P>
        <P>The Hederman O&rsquo;Brien review has helped inform the development and updating of policy in this area. This learning has been given practical effect through, for example, the publication of the Children First Guidelines, the establishment of both the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the implementation of the Children&rsquo;s Act 2001.</P>
        <P>It is clear, therefore, that the issues raised by this case have been the subject of extensive review and action by the Medical Council, the 1996 review and the initiatives taken since then in relation to protecting children.  In these circumstances, I have indicated that I do not propose to establish a further inquiry.</P>
        <P>Instead I believe that our focus should now be on supporting those affected and ensuring that every possible protection is given to vulnerable people in the future.</P>
        <P>It is very important to ensure that appropriate counselling is available to all those who have been in contact with the HSE and/or the hospital following the recent Medical Council Inquiry.  The HSE has made arrangements for counselling support for all those who have been in contact <Col N="357"/>with them following the recent Medical Council Inquiry, using the National Counselling Service. Over 100 people have made contact with this service and the service will continue to be made available as required. The need for additional support will be monitored by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The HSE and I are anxious that all former patients of the consultant are made aware of the free counselling support that is available.  The HSE has assigned co-ordinating responsibility for these matters to the Area Manager for Consumer Affairs in the North East who will continue to liaise as required with former patients and support groups.</P>

	<P>At present EU food labelling legislation is harmonised by Council Directive 2000/13/EC, transposed in 2002, with several amendments since. In January 2008, the European Commission presented its proposal for a new regulation updating and harmonising this legislation. This proposal, which is still under discussion, will both consolidate existing legislation in the area of food labelling and introduce certain new provisions, including a mandatory nutrition declaration and mandatory allergen labelling.  In November 2008, Ireland submitted its position paper on the proposal. This paper was informed by submissions made to the FSAI by many of the key stakeholders. Ireland&rsquo;s position will be further informed by the outcome of an FSAI Consumer Survey. This is expected to be completed in June 2009.</P>
        <P>EU food labelling requirements look to provide consumers with the information needed to make informed choices and to make safe use of food. A key principle underlying the labelling of food is that the purchaser must not be misled. The information on the label must be clear and unambiguous and must not be such as could mislead the consumer to a material degree &ldquo;as to the characteristics of the foodstuff and, in particular, as to its nature, identity,  properties, composition, quantity,  durability, origin or provenance, method of manufacture or  production&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The current rules on date of minimum durability, as set out in Article 9 of 2000/13/EC, require one of two options. Foodstuffs, which from a microbiological point of view are highly perishable and are, therefore, likely after a short period to constitute an immediate danger to human health, must indicate a &ldquo;use by date&rdquo;. However, other foodstuffs which can reasonably be expected to retain the specific properties that are normally associated with that foodstuff carry a &ldquo;best before date&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>These minimum durability requirements have been incorporated into the new EU proposal for the provision of food information to consumers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P>Some 35,000 completed application forms have been received by the Scheme Administrator.  To date, 33,913 or 96.89% of applicants have now either received an offer or have been rejected.  As a result, there is in the region of a further 1,000 claims to be processed.</P>
        <P>The Scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to settle claims as quickly as possible.  However, there are a number of different factors which have affected the length of time it takes to process a claim:</P>
        <P>A very high number of deficiencies have appeared on claim forms which must be rectified before they can be processed. It is estimated that approximately two thirds of all claim forms were submitted without some critical piece of information which meant that the claim could not be processed until the Scheme Administrator had written to the potential claimant and requested the information required.  In addition, in excess of 75% of all Form of Entitlement <Col N="360"/>forms submitted were deficient. The HSE and the Scheme Administrator have taken a proactive role in addressing this issue.</P>
        <P>Over 13,500 estates who have lodged claims to date did not have a grant of representation, as required by law, and the Scheme Administrator has had to establish probate before the claim can be progressed. This is to ensure that the person entitled to claim on behalf of an estate is the person who ultimately receives the repayment.  The probate process can typically be a lengthy one &mdash; however a special system established for the purposes of this scheme has significantly reduced the waiting period. The majority of certificates of entitlement have now been issued and this has facilitated people in proceeding with the application proper. The requirements of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 rightly place a strong emphasis on detail and on ensuring that a person is entitled to make the application and would be the rightful recipient of any potential repayment. For example this would be particularly important in determining who would be eligible in the case of a deceased person where no grant of probate was made and where several family members might make an application for repayment.</P>
        <P>All relevant HSE facilities around the country&ndash; over 330 in total &mdash; have had to be visited by the Scheme Administrator to review and retrieve their records of payment.  In some cases, these records dated as far back as 1976.  The format in which this information was stored varied widely between institutions and usually included a mixture of paper files, handwritten files and computer files. All of this information had to be scanned and uploaded onto a usable database and this process took over 6 months to complete.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind the various challenges that have arisen during the course of the scheme to date, the waiting time for each applicant has varied based upon the factors outlined above. The Scheme Administrator continues to work closely with the HSE to process claims as speedily and efficiently as possible.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the vast majority of the 1,000 remaining claims will be processed in the next few weeks.  However, it should be noted that the repayments offered cannot be paid until the statutory 28 day period for appeal has elapsed and a completed acceptance form has been returned to the Scheme Administrator.  In addition, claimants who receive offers must be given the opportunity if they so wish, to appeal the Scheme Administrator&rsquo;s decision.  There are currently over 2,000 appeals being worked on at present and this will impact on the timeframe for finalisation of the Health Repayment Scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The State retained a 25% ownership in Aer Lingus to protect strategic interests.  The primary concern in this context was to provide a basis to oppose a takeover of the company that may not have been in Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interests.  The value of the State&rsquo;s stake in this context has already been demonstrated.  As a 25% shareholder, the Government has no role in the day-to-day management of the company.</P>
        <P>In addition to providing a basis to oppose takeovers, a stake of over 25% also allows a shareholder to block special resolutions.  One notable example of where such a resolution is required is for the purpose of making changes in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company.  This provides a protection for two specific interests of the State.  It means that the relevant provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Associations that (a) ensure that the State will have the right to appoint three directors and (b) provide for a safeguard against any disposal of Heathrow slots, cannot be changed without the approval of the State.</P>
        <P>The duties of all directors on the Board of Aer Lingus derive from the Companies Acts and they are obliged to pursue the best interests of the company.  Subject to that duty, the State-nominated directors on the Board were issued with a mandate on the date of their respective appointments requesting them to seek to ensure that all future decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level. In any such decisions they are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives.</P>
        <P>On 11 June 2009 the Chairman of Aer Lingus briefed me on proposals for transatlantic services for the winter season 2009/10 and for the enhancement of the Shannon-Heathrow service.  Following that meeting I immediately wrote to the three directors to remind them of their mandate and requested that they take account of this in the Board&rsquo;s consideration of the proposals.</P>

In accordance with the legislation I make decisions on naturalisation applications based on all of the information available to me.  I have adopted a general policy that I will normally require an applicant for naturalisation, unless he/she is a refugee, programme refugee or Stateless person, to show that he/she has supported him or herself (and his or her family if appropriate) while residing in the State and, as far as can be determined, is in a position to continue that support into the future.  I am, generally speaking, satisfied to accept that an applicant is self supporting if he or she has not availed of State support in the 3 year period prior to the date of application or subsequently has satisfied officials that they have supported themselves independently for that period.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in May 2008. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.<b> </b>Officials inform me that the application is at an advanced stage of processing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. One of these conditions is that the applicant must have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.</P>
        <P>Applicants for a certificate of naturalisation are required to provide evidence that they have been resident and that they have had the permission of the Minister to remain in the State for the prescribed period. Permission to remain in the State as confirmed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau is a matter of vital importance to all applicants for Citizenship. Applicants must ensure that their registration with the Garda National Immigration Bureau is kept up to date during their residency in this country.</P>
        <P>While it may not be deemed prejudicial to an application for naturalisation should an applicant wish to leave the State for short periods, each case is considered individually. In circumstances where the person in question wishes to leave the State while his-her application is being processed, he-she should notify the citizenship section of the dates of travel and the reasons for same. The legal provisions governing naturalisation require that a naturalised person continue to reside in the State after naturalisation, and any long-term absences will be assessed in that light. Officials in the Citizenship Division of my Department inform me that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.</P>

I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person in question made a Family Reunification application in January 2006 and a decision was issued to the person in question on 9 July 2008. However, the letter containing that decision was subsequently returned undelivered to my Department. The decision letter was reissued on 11 March 2009 to the new address which the Deputy provided for the person in question. I am further informed that the Deputy was advised in my previous reply that if the person in question wishes to submit additional information to support his application for family reunification he can do so and this will be taken into consideration in reaching a decision.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2008. On examination of the application submitted it was determined that the application form had not been fully completed. It was returned to the person in question for further attention on 18 April, 2008. The person in <Col N="372"/>question returned the application form to the Citizenship Division but the application form was returned again to the applicant on 1 July, 2008 as the application form was still incomplete. The Citizenship Division of my Department wrote to the person in question on 16 October, 2008 requesting she return her completed application form and supporting documentation in order for her application to be processed further. A 21 day letter was issued on 22 January, 2009. To date the Citizenship Division of my Department have not received the requested documentation and the application has been deemed ineligible.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person in question to lodge a new application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when she is in a position to meet the statutory requirements. Officials in the General Immigration Division of my Department inform me that Temporary permission to remain in the State was granted to the person concerned on 14 August, 2007 until 14 August, 2010.</P>

	<P>The Fines Bill 2009, which is currently before the House and awaiting Committee Stage, makes provision for the payment of fines by instalments.  Section 14 of the Bill allows a person on whom a fine has been imposed, to apply to the court to pay the fine by instalments.  If the court is satisfied that to pay in full by the due date would cause undue financial hardship, it can direct that the fine be paid by instalments over a period not exceeding one year.  An extension of not more that a further year may be given by the court where it is satisfied that the financial circumstances of the person have changed and the change is not due to that person&rsquo;s culpable neglect. </P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>As part of Budget 2009, the minimum weekly contribution which a person is expected to contribute towards their rent was increased from &euro;13 to &euro;18 with effect from January 2009.  The recent Supplementary Budget provided that the weekly minimum contribution be further increased from &euro;18 to &euro;24 with effect from 1 June 2009 and that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% from the same date.  These <Col N="375"/>measures account for the reduction in the rent supplement payment of the person concerned this year.</P>
        <P>Each existing recipient of rent supplement was advised in advance, by letter, of the particular reductions being made to their rent supplement payment from 1 June 2009.  This letter also advised that if the recipient wanted to talk to their landlord to seek a reduction in rent, the Department&rsquo;s letter could be shown to a landlord as evidence of their reduced rent supplement payment.</P>
        <P>The most recent data published by the CSO show that rents in the private sector have fallen by almost 11% since November 2008 and by almost 20% in the past year.  It is essential that state support for tenants who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution of &euro;24, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than &euro;24 because they are also required to contribute, towards their accommodation costs, any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
        <P>The Executive has advised that the person concerned was refused rent supplement as her total income from one-parent family payment, occupational injuries benefit and maintenance is sufficient to meet her accommodation costs.  This decision has been upheld by a HSE designated Appeals Officer.  It is open to the person concerned to appeal against this decision to the Department&rsquo;s independent Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO). To date no such appeal has been received.</P>

	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  In 2009, almost &euro;18 million has been provided to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload.  There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9 am to 8 pm Monday to Friday at lo-call number 1890 283 438 and budgeting and money management information can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie.  </P>
        <P>Cork MABS has 7 money advice staff and provides service to Cork city, in the main, as well as east Cork and other parts of the county.  It is one of 4 MABS with a total of 17 money advice staff that provide services throughout County Cork.  North Cork MABS has 4 money advice staff and is based in Mallow.  West Cork MABS has 3 money advice staff and is located in Dunmanway and Charleville MABS has 3 money advice staff.  Applications for funding for additional staff are kept under review should any further funding become available for extra posts.</P>
        <P>All MABS companies, including Cork MABS, operate an appointment system for meeting clients.  Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and dealt with promptly.  Less urgent cases are referred to the National Telephone Helpline and to the MABS website for immediate assistance with budgeting and money management issues.  The Helpline can now handle less complex straight forward single debt cases such as threatened utility disconnections and deals directly with the ESB and An Bord G&aacute;is in relation to these cases.  Over 90% of callers to the Helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline advisor.  Some 10% of callers are referred to the local MABS for appointment.</P><Col N="377"/>
        <P>In addition the Helpline provides assistance to local services to manage their appointment lists by providing an initial preliminary MABS service to clients and ongoing support while they await their appointment with their local money advisor.</P>
        <P>The MABS advises that people coping with debt difficulties should take early action.  An approach to MABS via any of the channels can be the first positive step in addressing debt difficulties.  The MABS provides a high quality personal service that helps many people to cope with and overcome the burden of indebtedness that can have such an impact on their lives and that of their families.</P>

        <P>All relevant Government Departments are working on the development of further measures to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.  This work is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, which is chaired by the Taoiseach.  I have been reporting progress to the Oireachtas on an annual basis when I present the Carbon Budget to this House.  While the measures are relevant to our Kyoto compliance over the 2008-2012 period, their longer-term impact is of even more importance.  Significant structural change is required across all sectors of our economy if we are to meet the much more demanding targets to which we are now committing ourselves.  Under the recent EU climate and energy package, Ireland has taken on a target of a 20% reduction in emissions between 2005 and 2020, and this target will increase further when a new global agreement on climate change is reached, hopefully in Copenhagen next December.</P>
        <P>The EPA is responsible for emission projections.  Its most recent analysis, which reflected the ESRI&rsquo;s then assessment of the changed economic situation, was published in March 2009.  The updated figures indicated a Distance to Target for the Kyoto period 2008-2012 in the range of 1.3-1.8 million tonnes per annum, a reduction of around 3 million tonnes from the projections of Autumn 2008.</P>
        <P>In the current economic climate, an unusually high degree of uncertainty attaches to all projections.  It is now clear that the economic contraction will be deeper than assumed in the March projections.  It is quite possible that Ireland will now meet its Kyoto target for the non-trading sector without using carbon credits.</P>
        <P>The global economic downturn is also leading to a fall in the market price of carbon credits.  While the Government&rsquo;s projections of the cost of the purchasing requirement had assumed an average unit price of &euro;15, markets are currently operating at closer to &euro;11.  Overall, the cost to the Government will be much less than previously forecast due to the fall in both the volume and unit price of carbon credits.</P>
        <P>The National Treasury Management Agency has, to date, purchased some 5.255 million credits at a cost of some &euro;73.7 million.  In addition, investments made by my Department in 2006 and 2007 in carbon funds operated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and <Col N="381"/>Development and the World Bank are expected to yield some 3 million credits at a projected cost of some &euro;27.6 million during the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>Our purchasing requirements are being kept under review and will be revised as necessary in the light of future projections.  The National Treasury Agency (NTMA) has been asked to put its purchasing programme on hold for the foreseeable future.  If it transpires that the credits which have been secured are not needed in the Kyoto period they can be carried forward for use in the next commitment period.</P>
        <P>It is important to emphasise that the effect of the recession on our emissions is a short-term one and it would be a serious mistake to ease off on our efforts to address the underlying trend.  When economic growth resumes, so too will our emissions grow unless we have the measures in place to reduce business.  The Government remains focused on this work through the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.</P>

	<P>Allocations totalling &euro;79.562 million were notified to local authorities under the Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme for Older People and People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme and the old Disabled Persons &amp; Essential Repairs Grant Schemes on 7 May 2009. These allocations represent an 11.4% increase on the initial allocation for 2008.</P>
        <P>At this stage I do not envisage making further allocations to local authorities in 2009.  However, I intend to review the funding position later in the year, in the event of any under- spend by local authorities of their allocations for the grant schemes or other allocations under the wider social housing investment programme.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s 2005 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing state that, in rural areas under strong urban pressure, planning applications for a single rural dwelling from persons who demonstrate &lsquo;local need&rsquo; in terms of strong links to the local community should be accommodated, subject to the normal planning criteria of siting, waste water disposal etc.  The Guidelines give examples of such links, e.g. farmers, their sons and daughters or persons involved in full-time farming or forestry.  It is a matter for each planning authority to adopt the local need criteria which will apply to its area as part of its development plan.  The interpretation of policy and its application in individual cases is a matter for each planning authority and, upon appeal, for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>I understand from North Tipperary County Council that, while the person in question has had pre-planning consultations with the Council, he has not proceeded with making a planning application.  He has been informed that should he make a planning application and receive a decision which he is dissatisfied with, he would have the option to appeal the decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, who have the statutory remit independently to adjudicate on planning decisions.</P>
        <P>Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has no function in the operational matters of the <Col N="383"/>Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), which is an independent statutory body established under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific cases or classes of case.</P>
        <P>The Residential Tenancies Act sets out dispute resolution services and procedures to be delivered by the PRTB and specifies notice periods, cooling-off periods and other related timeframes.  However, it is acknowledged that, partly as a consequence of the Board&rsquo;s success in ensuring compliance with the registration requirements of the Act, and the resulting large workloads arising, the processing times for dispute resolution are not yet optimal.  At the same time, it is important to note that less than 1% of all registered tenancies seek to avail of the PRTB&rsquo;s dispute resolution mechanisms.  This indicates that a healthy and stable landlord-tenant relationship prevails in the vast majority of tenancies.</P>
        <P>The PRTB is committed to delivering its services in as timely a manner as possible and it has set out a clear strategic approach to reducing its backlog of disputes cases.  My Department supports the PRTB in this approach and, last year, in response to the large and ongoing volume of work involved, a request from the Board of the PRTB for the recruitment of an additional 14 permanent staff, to bring the permanent staffing complement from 26 to 40, was approved.  This has been of significant benefit to the Board in dealing with the administrative work associated with the processing of dispute cases.</P>
        <P>The PRTB has taken a number of other initiatives to optimise its throughput of dispute cases, including the introduction of a system of paper-based adjudications on a trial basis.  Early indications are that these initiatives are helping to speed up the dispute resolution process.  In the longer term, an automated document management system will also be introduced by the PRTB as part of their recently adopted ICT strategy, the roll-out of which has now commenced and which, I understand, the PRTB expect to have implemented by the end of 2010.  This should also yield staffing and process efficiencies for the organisation in general and expedite the processing of dispute cases in particular.</P>
        <P>Finally, I recently announced my intention to review the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 under which the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) operates.  The purpose of this review is to consider whether the Act best supports the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.  I hope that this review will yield preliminary outcomes by Autumn 2009.</P>

        <Quest> the progress made on securing a further memorandum of understanding with car manufacturers and charging infrastructure providers following the agreements with a company (details supplied) and the ESB to promote the rapid rollout of electric cars; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020 will equate to up to 250,000 cars on Irish roads.  This scale of deployment of electric vehicles will have a significant impact in terms of reducing carbon emissions and imported oil consumption in the transport sector.  The challenge now is to develop costed options for the establishment, operation and mainten<Col N="384"/>ance of electric vehicle infrastructure network in Ireland, together with possible measures to develop a market for the vehicles themselves.</P>
        <P>The Memorandum of Understanding which I recently concluded with Renault-Nissan will greatly increase the level of knowledge available on the infrastructure requirements of electric vehicles and ensure that Ireland has the opportunity to be one of the first countries to be supplied with both Renault and Nissan electric cars.  Under the existing Memorandum of Understanding ESB Networks are availing of data on developments in electric vehicles which are being used to inform consideration of optimum infrastructure, possible support mechanisms and the potential benefits accruing.  This work will provide us with a solid basis for electric vehicle deployment policy and inform our dealings with other technology providers, including vehicle manufacturers and infrastructure developers.</P>
        <P>The Memorandum of Understanding does not convey any exclusive rights in relation to the provision of electric cars.  Ireland is open for business to all manufacturers in relation to electric vehicles.  I believe we need to build relationships with all global players in the sector.  More generally, work to progress the strategic framework for deployment of electric vehicles is under way.  The inter-departmental/agency Taskforce is meeting regularly to progress the framework for deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  It is chaired by my Department and comprises the Departments of Transport, Finance, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), ESB, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce is developing the options and timeframe for putting in place the necessary infrastructure and other arrangements for the national roll-out of electric vehicles.  Full account will also be taken of global developments as the technologies mature.  The Taskforce will shortly report its initial findings and advise on next steps.  Three working groups have been set up under the aegis of the Taskforce.  These are the Transport/Infrastructure Group, the Fiscal Group, and the Enterprise Group.  The work of these groups will inform the Taskforce&rsquo;s main report.  Employment opportunities, the costs involved in providing car charging infrastructure and all associated issues including funding options will be addressed in the report.  The ESB and SEI have been working intensively as part of the Taskforce and visited Israel and Denmark last year to study their approaches to fast tracking the deployment of electric vehicles.  The ambitions of other countries underline the importance of positioning Ireland at the forefront of deployment of electric vehicles.</P>

	<P>The range of renewable energy support measures in place includes a number of measures that may prove particularly suitable to farmers or those living in rural areas.</P><Col N="386"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>In the first instance, there are measures in place to support the generation of electricity on a micro scale as I announced earlier in the year.  These measures include a guaranteed price of 19 cent per kilowatt hour of electricity produced.  This competitive feed-in tariff will apply to the first 4,000 micro-generation installations countrywide over the next three years.  Access to the feed-in tariff will also include the provision of a smart-meter to facilitate exports to the grid and encourage those customers to examine their electricity use generally.  Eligible installations include small scale wind, photovoltaic, hydro and micro combined heat and power.  While there is an upper limit on the size of eligible units, this type of technology would still prove worthwhile for farmers, if only for their own residences.</P>
        <P>The initiation of a pilot trial by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) of micro and small-scale generation technologies is designed to investigate and test technical, market and regulatory issues associated with the deployment of micro-generation technologies including installation, network connection and operation, and generation.  Grant aid for up to 50 pilot installations, will be provided as part of the programme. The experience gained in the performance of this programme will inform the roll-out of any subsequent wider micro-scale programme.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, the electricity network was designed to accommodate the flow of electricity from large centralised plants to customers dispersed throughout the country.  Micro-generation at local level now introduces two-way flows to the electricity system.  Local generators will have the ability to be paid by the ESB for electricity that is surplus to their own requirements and export it back to the national grid.</P>
        <P>Opportunities also exist in the areas of Biomass production and Anaerobic Digestion (AD). Leaving aside the market development effects of programmes like Greener Homes and the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (Reheat), both of which have acted to stimulate the market for biomass, a number of other capital support programmes are also in place. SEI&rsquo;s Combined Heat and Power (CHP) grants programme launched in August 2006, assists the deployment of small-scale fossil-fired and biomass CHP systems in industrial, commercial, service and public sectors, and the new Biomass CHP Programme, launched in January 2008, provides grant aid for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion CHP.  Anerobic Digestion, in particular, offers a real opportunity for farmers to use animal waste to generate electricity, while also reducing the environmental impact of that waste when spread on the land.  Refit tariffs have also been announced for biomass and AD CHP.</P>

	<P>As published in the Revised Budget, the Energy Research allocation for 2009 is &euro;16,676m, of which &euro;642,000 is current and the remainder is capital.  This allocation will allow a broad range of Programmes to continue, such as the Renewable Energy Research, Demonstration and Development (RD&amp;D) programme, and the work of the Ocean Energy Development Unit. This suite of programmes reflect the strategic direction set out in the Irish Energy Research Council Report, and in the 2007 Energy White Paper entitled, &lsquo;Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland &mdash; The Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>In particular, the Government is giving high priority to supporting the development of Ireland&rsquo;s ocean energy potential.  The multi-annual Ocean Energy Package, which I launched <Col N="387"/>last year, encompasses the establishment of the Ocean Energy Development Unit based in Sustainable Energy Ireland; the creation of a state-of-the-art National Ocean Energy facility in University College Cork; the development of a grid-connected wave energy test site off the west coast; the establishment of an Ocean Energy Prototype Fund; and the introduction of a new feed-in-tariff under the REFIT scheme for wave and tidal technologies of &euro;220 per Megawatt Hour.  I am pleased to confirm that all components of the Package are under way and are being progressed as a priority, with the full involvement of stakeholders, by the Ocean Energy Development Unit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The role of the Government in the electronic communications market in Ireland is to formulate policy to facilitate the provision of high quality services by competing service providers.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These initiatives have helped to facilitate the development of the market.  According to the latest Central Statistics Office report &lsquo;Information Society and Telecommunications 2008&rsquo; published in May 2009, 62% of Irish households and 83% of SMEs now have a broadband connection.  Ireland also has more residential and SME subscriptions in the higher speed category i.e. 2-10 Mbps than in the lower speed category of up to 2 Mbps.</P>
        <P>The latest OECD report, which includes data up to December 2008, is also testament to the considerable improvement of recent years.  It shows that Ireland is ranked 9th out of 30 countries in year on year broadband growth. With similar fast uptake of broadband noted in previous reports, Ireland has closed the gap on the OECD average with our improvement over the past 2 years.  Additionally, it should be noted that mobile broadband, which is very popular with Irish broadband subscribers, is not yet published for the purposes of international statistical comparisons.  However, mobile broadband statistics are expected to be published by the OECD in the future reports.  The publication of mobile broadband statistics is expected to improve Ireland&rsquo;s ranking further.</P>
        <P>There are still some parts of the country where the private sector cannot justify the commercial provision of broadband services. Accordingly, my Department has undertaken to implement the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and has entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.  Services were rolled out in some rural areas at the end of April 2009 and the entire NBS area will be served by September 2010.</P>
        <P>Internationally, electronic communications markets are moving to provide next generation broadband in order to deliver greater quality, speed and service to consumers.  This is happening where there is strong competition and incentives to innovate. The policy framework for future broadband development in Ireland is set out in the consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband, which I published last July.  The consultation period on the paper has now concluded and I will publish the final policy paper shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As required under EU Council Regulation No. 1100 of 2007, Ireland submitted a Government approved draft Eel Management Plan to the Commission for approval.  I am not aware of the content of the eel plans submitted by other Member States.  These, along with Ireland&rsquo;s draft plan are currently being evaluated by the European Commission.  Clearly the status of stocks in other Member States will differ from that of Ireland&rsquo;s depending on local conditions and their plans may make different recommendations.  All must, however, clearly demonstrate how they would achieve the targets necessary for recovery of the European eel stocks.  The European Commission is scheduled to report back on this evaluation by the end of this month in accordance with the EC Regulation.</P>
        <P>I am alert to the concerns and the impact the required conservation measures will have on commercial eel fishermen.  In 2008 there were 296 licences, taken out by between 100-150 fishermen, not all of which were actively fished.  Fishermen were permitted to catch brown eels <Col N="389"/>from June to August and silver eels from September to December.  Catches have been declining over recent years because of the status of stocks.  Eel fishing is not a full time occupation and is restricted to certain months of the year.  Experienced eel fishermen would be in a very strong position to tender competitively for the provision of the &lsquo;trap and transport&rsquo; operations recently advertised by ESB.  I have encouraged eel fishermen to form the appropriate co-operatives or other ventures to best compete for these contracts.  There will also be a limited amount of fishing associated with the research and monitoring to be carried out under the plan spread over 7 water bodies.</P>
        <P>Eel stocks are a European wide shared stock with mature eels leaving European shores to spawn in the Saragossa Sea and the resulting glass eels returning to the European coastline.  The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicated that the European eel stock is at a historic low and continues to decline.  The returning juvenile eels are at between 1-10% of the levels pre-1980.  I am advised that the low recruitment of juvenile eels in 2009 appears to be the worst yet and gives rise to serious concern for the future of the eel.  Eel fishing is one of the factors identified in the Eel Management Plan as impacting on eel mortality, the others being turbine mortality, poor recruitment, and environmental and water quality issues.  The Eel Management Plan submitted to the EU Commission sets out measures designed to address all these causes in an effort to save this vulnerable species not only for its own sake but also to protect ecological biodiversity.  To do otherwise would consign our remaining stock, challenged by so many pressures to possible extinction.</P>

	<P>The Government has recently announced that it has given approval to the development by EirGrid of the East-West Interconnector. The East-West Interconnector is a 500 Megawatt High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnector, which will link the electricity grids of Ireland and <Col N="390"/>Britain.The interconnector will, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned and operated by EirGrid.  State ownership of this strategic energy infrastructure will ensure that costs are minimised and benefits are passed on to consumers.</P>
        <P>The benefits for the economy, the energy market and consumers include: Enhancing security of energy supply by delivering additional capacity to the all-island electricity market and linking it to the UK, which is in turn connected to mainland European markets; Underpinning delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s renewable generation targets by providing additional back-up at times of low wind and enabling the export of wind energy from Ireland at times of high wind generation; Supporting further competition in the electricity market and exerting downward pressure on prices; diversifying the national fuel mix and supply sources by reducing our dependence on electricity generated from imported natural gas; and providing EirGrid, as the system operator, with important back-up and reserve services.  The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Act 2008 provides the necessary legal basis for EirGrid to construct, own and operate an interconnector.</P>
        <P>In a strong endorsement by the European Union of the project, Ireland has secured &euro;110 million for the East West interconnector under the European Economic Recovery Plan.  The contract for the development of the East West interconnector has been recently awarded to ABB on foot of an open, tender process conducted by EirGrid under the regulatory oversight of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  Working closely with the CER and with the Department, EirGrid is progressing the project to schedule for completion and operational start up by 2012.  The project is on track to meet the completion date subject to the outcome of the planning processes, which are currently under way.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178, 183 and 184 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has set targets to increase the contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity consumed to 15% at least by 2010 and 40% at least by 2020. The 2010 target exceeds an EU target addressed to Ireland to increase the contribution from renewable sources to 13.2% of electricity consumed by 2010 and the 40% target is consistent with an EU target addressed to Ireland to increase the contribution from renewable sources to 16% of all energy consumed by 2020. The Government has also set a target to develop 500 MWs of ocean powered technologies. These technologies remain in the research phase. Target completion is dependent on the pace of development of this sector to deliver a commercially viable industry.</P>
        <P>The current support programme for new renewable energy powered electricity generating plants, REFIT, accepts projects on a first come first served basis. The Commission for Energy <Col N="391"/>Regulation (CER) in its Gate 3 decision allocating connection offers for an additional 3900 MWs of capacity also adopted a first come first served policy to prioritise projects. There is therefore no declared preference for any proven technology over another.</P>
        <P>There are now 1,400 megawatts (MWS) of renewable powered capacity approximately generating electricity. These plants contributed 12.2% of all electricity consumed in 2008. There are more than 1400 MWs of additional capacity accepted into the REFIT support programme.  The REFIT projects have already secured planning permission and connection offers. Less than 300 MWs of this additional capacity will be sufficient to achieve and surpass the 2010 target.  The excess above 300 MWs in REFIT and the additional 3900 MWs identified in the Gate 3 decision by the CER are capable of delivering and exceeding the 2020 target.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179, 180 and 181 together.</P>
        <P>Currently the only discovery of oil and gas declared commercial is the Corrib Gas Field and, as the Deputy was advised in the reply to Question No. 517 on 10 February 2009, the developers Shell E&amp;P Ireland Ltd have stated their expectation that first gas will be available in the last quarter of 2010.  Completion of the development works by the developers is the principal factor that will ultimately determine the date for first gas.</P>
        <P>With regard to non-petroleum minerals, exploration and development is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999.  New exploration is continually undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of Prospecting Licences, of which there are currently 487.  Details of these Licenses can be found in the six-monthly report to the Oireachtas, which I am obliged to lay before the House under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999.  The last such report was in respect of the six-month period ended 30 December 2008.  I will lay the report for the six months to 31 June 2009 before the House as soon as possible after the end of that period.</P>
        <P>No new economic deposits of non-petroleum minerals have been discovered in recent years.  There have been some encouraging results, however.  Details of the number of Mineral Prospecting Licences and Petroleum Exploration Licences granted in the period 2004 to 2009 are contained in the following table:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Twenty-one of the Petroleum Exploration Licences issued between 2004 and 2008 are still active and as of 30 May 2009, there were a total of four hundred and eighty-seven active Prospecting Licences.  Exploration activity related to the agreed work programmes for each licence is ongoing.  The licensing terms for offshore oil and gas exploration were amended in 2007 and apply to the ten Petroleum Exploration Licences issued since 1 January 2007.  The eleven Exploration Licences issued between 2004 and 2006 that are still active are subject to the 1992 licensing terms for offshore oil and gas exploration.</P>

	<P>The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) Schemes have resulted in 18 projects overall being awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010.  Of these projects, four are in the biodiesel category, four are in the bioethanol category, five are in the captive fleets category and five are in the pure plant oil category.  My Department does not have details of companies outside of the MOTR Schemes who may be producing biofuel.</P>
        <P>It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the position of individual companies within the schemes.  I can advise the Deputy that under Scheme One over 6.8 m litres of biofuel has been produced while in 2008 over 82 million litres of biofuel was produced under the MOTR Scheme II.</P>
        <P>Overall there have been at least five biofuels plants constructed or redeveloped on foot of excise relief granted under the schemes.  A number of others are either at an advanced stage of planning, or have received planning permission.  All but two of the projects are currently availing of the excise relief and my Department liaises with all project promoters on a regular basis.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting an educational placement and to provide early intervention for pre-school children with autism.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as the tuition takes place outside of school supervision there is a need to ensure that the tuition provider is a fully qualified teacher.  However if it is not possible to recruit a tuition provider with a teaching qualification then alternative qualifications are acceptable as an interim measure until such time as a qualified teacher is recruited.  A list of relevant qualifications may be sourced on my Department&rsquo;s website on www.education.ie.</P>
        <P>It is in the interests of children to expect that home tutors funded under this scheme are appropriately qualified tuition providers.  It is for this reason that tuition providers will be required to meet the minimum qualification standard.  Twenty hours tuition per week has been sanctioned for the child in question.  The proposed tuition providers do not appear to meet the qualification requirement and further information has been sought in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193, 204 and 205 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department issued responses to all schools who appealed the decision to suppress classes for pupils with a Mild General Learning Disability (MGLD) on 11 June.</P>
        <P>Correspondence was received from 49 schools in this regard. My Department has considered the correspondence and has determined that:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />10 classes will be retained in 11 schools;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Further information has been requested from 3 schools and a decision will issue to the schools as soon as this has been considered;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The original decision to discontinue MGLD classes remains in the case of 35 schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It was noted in the material submitted by many of the schools that there are situations where a number of children enrolled in the MGLD classes fall within the low incidence disability category. In these cases, schools have been advised to liaise with their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) in the context of their eligibility for resource teaching support. In one case discussions are ongoing between a school and SENO concerning the re-designation of a MGLD class.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s decision to suppress a number of MGLD classes was on the basis that the enrolment numbers in these special classes did not have the minimum number of pupils required to retain the special class teacher. This was the sole criteria for the selection of schools and therefore not a matter for the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>I will arrange to have details of the individual schools forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>In the 2007/08 school year there were 32,831 pupils attending schools that stated Irish as their medium of instruction in the Annual Census of Primary Schools.  Of these, 3,584 pupils were in sixth class. I will arrange that the Deputy be contacted directly regarding the numbers receiving tuition through the medium of Irish at second level.</P>
        <P>The Commission on School Accommodation published a report in 2004 on the criteria and procedures for establishing and maintaining provision through the medium of Irish in second level schools or clusters of schools. As part of its examination of the issues the Technical Working Group of the Commission conducted an analysis of the transfer rates of pupils educated through Irish from primary to post-primary levels. That analysis showed that the national average of transfer rate from gaeltacht schools to second level Irish medium schools was 47% at that time. The national average transfer rate from gaelscoileanna to second level Irish medium schools was 40% at the time. The report noted however that there was a very wide range in the transfer rates across different schools and areas. The report also noted that the wide range in transfer rates reflected, as well as location factors, a wide spectrum of attitudes, beliefs and aims of parents regarding education through Irish at second level.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently considering a range of policy issues in relation to patronage at second level, including issues regarding commencement of new schools. The further development of second level provision through the medium of Irish will be fully considered in this context.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department would only hold records on those former residents who were placed in Industrial &amp; Reformatory schools by way of a Court hearing.  Many children would have been placed in Industrial &amp; Reformatory schools by alternative means, e.g. Health Board referrals, voluntary placements, etc and, in such circumstances, my Department would not generally hold records for such persons.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department has already indicated that there are gaps in the archive of material held which in effect means that the numbers of transfers as are referred to by the Deputy cannot be compiled.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, special provision is made relating to the &ldquo;residence&rdquo; requirement. One such provision states that abuse of a child &ldquo;in an institution&rdquo; includes any case in which the abuse took place, not in the institution itself, but while the child was residing or being cared for in the institution and the abuse was committed or aided by a person engaged in the management or supervision of the institution or a person otherwise employed in or associated with the institution. Our understanding is that this covers persons who were officially resident in a scheduled institution but who may have been temporarily placed outside the institution during the period of their residency.</P>

        <Quest> when the existing temporary recognition status of a school (details supplied) in County Kildare will come to an end; the outcome of a recent meeting between himself and the school authorities in connection with the wishes of parents to have this project advanced; if negotiations with himself and third parties have begun regarding potential sites for a building project in respect of this school; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>My Department is guided by a Commission on School Accommodation (CSA) Report produced in 2004 on the &ldquo;Criteria and Procedures for establishing and maintaining provision through the medium of Irish in second level schools&rdquo;. The report recommends that for an Irish Medium school to be recognised, it must have:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />An initial first year projected enrolment of 30 pupils;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A projected average first year enrolment of 40 pupils over six years;</P><Col N="398"/>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A projected total enrolment of 250-300, six years after opening;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Suitable accommodation; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Compliance with Section 10 of the Education Act, 1998.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The school to which the Deputy refers has a current enrolment of 105 pupils which falls short of that needed for permanent recognition. In the circumstances, earlier this year, my Department extended the school&rsquo;s temporary recognition for a further three years to allow it the opportunity to develop further.</P>
        <P>Schools with temporary recognition are not entitled to capital funding and accommodation for such schools remains the responsibility of a Patron until permanent recognition has been given and until the Department is in a position to make capital provision for them subject to competing demands for the funding available.</P>
        <P>With regard to my recent meeting with the school, I have asked my officials to discuss the availability of a site, where the school wishes to re-locate and this will be done in due course.  My officials will not be entering into any negotiations in relation to this site as this is the responsibility of the Patron.  My Department&rsquo;s preferred option is for the school to remain in its existing accommodation and it has issued a letter supporting its appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for retention of planning permission on these premises.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 to 201, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Some 217 schools have applied for additional/replacement temporary accommodation this year.  100 schools have been approved so far to either purchase temporary accommodation, to build a permanent structure with the funding available or to rent accommodation.  Rentals have been approved where the duration of the need is likely to be short term.  Purchase/build has been approved where the need will be long term.</P><Col N="399"/>
        <P>The projects in question are currently out to tender.  The value will be known when the tendering process has been completed.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to approve all applications received.  Therefore, in assessing these applications, my Department prioritises schools that need additional accommodation to cater for increasing enrolments over the replacement of existing accommodation as any other approach could, potentially, leave pupils without school places.   The application from the school to which the Deputy refers was unsuccessful for this reason.</P>
        <P>The following list contains the details of the schools which were approved for funding.</P>

        <P>My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2009, the standard per capita grant was increased by &euro;14 per pupil and now amounts to &euro;345 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of &euro;8 per pupil in 2009 in the support services grant bringing that grant to &euro;212 per pupil.</P>
        <P>The cumulative increase of &euro;22 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to &euro;557 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example, in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over &euro;318,500. The corresponding figure in 2000 was approximately &euro;147,300.</P>
        <P>Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector, along with those in the VEC sector, are increased on a pro rata basis in line with increases in the per capita grant paid to voluntary secondary schools. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</P>
        <P>My Department has provided an estimated &euro;18.4 million per annum to voluntary secondary schools in equalisation funding to date.</P>
        <P>These significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. I will <Col N="404"/>consider how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level, as envisaged in the Programme for Government 2007-2012, having regard to available resources.</P>

	<P>In January 2009, I announced the establishment of the Steering Committee for the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, including catchment boundaries.  The review is being carried out as part of the 2009-2011 round of Value for Money Reviews approved by Government.</P>
        <P>The Steering Committee is looking at the original objectives of the scheme, whether these objectives remain valid today, the extent to which the objectives are being achieved and whether there are possibilities for economies or efficiencies that would improve the value for money of the scheme. In this context, the review will also look at fundamental issues such as catchment boundaries which is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The report is due to be completed by the end of 2009 and will then be published and sent to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Education and Science.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that schools which have enrolled children with autism have access to a wide number of support measures.  These include the allocation of teaching and/or care resources by the National Council for Special Education, reduced pupil-teacher ratios, enhanced capitation for special schools and special classes for pupils with autism; provision of funding for assisting technology and specialist equipment and specialist training for teachers in a range of autism specific interventions through the Special Education Support Service.  Qualifying pupils may also benefit from special school transport arrangements.</P>
        <P>Depending on each pupil&rsquo;s educational need and ability, pupils with autism may be enrolled in a mainstream class with additional teaching and/or care supports where needed; a special class for pupils with autism &mdash; this option may provide opportunities for partial integration in line with the pupil&rsquo;s abilities; or in special schools for pupils with autism or which have dedicated special classes for pupils with autism.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides early educational intervention for younger pre-school children who have been assessed as having autism.  This intervention may take place in one of a number of early intervention classes attached to a school or through the provision of a home tuition grant.</P>

        <P>However, pupils not attending their nearest national school may avail of concessionary fare-paying transport to another school, provided:</P>
<P el="5">(a) the written agreement of the board of management of the nearest school is secured;</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 and 211 together.</P>
        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is at present included in a rural cluster of primary schools. However, the school was also in receipt of a grant in lieu of Home School Community Liaison services under a previous disadvantage scheme. Under this arrangement the school combined resource hours with the unclusterable grant to provide a wholetime equivalent post in conflict the rule of the HSCL scheme which provide that coordinators should be deployed for full time HSCL duties only.</P>
        <P>This school is included in the rural element of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion and as such is entitled to the services of a rural coordinator and not of a HSCL coordinator.</P>
        <P>As a result of Budget 2009, rural coordinator services are being withdrawn from Non-DEIS schools with effect from 31 August 2009. Arising from this it was necessary to review the cluster arrangements for a number of rural DEIS schools. The rural coordinator service is now allocated to schools in line with their size and level of disadvantage. My Department is currently considering the most appropriate clustering arrangements for the school in question and five other rural DEIS schools in the area. All schools involved have been consulted and will be notified the decision on new clustering arrangements in due course.</P>

	<P>The intent of the Home Tuition scheme has not changed in the past twelve months. The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting an educational placement and to provide early intervention for pre-school children with autism.</P>
        <P>Each year the application forms and guidelines are reviewed in light of experience and changes may be made. Some small changes were made to the forms for this school year and were intended to improve the efficiency of the application process and reduce delays.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the scheme cost &euro;8,910,150. Home Tuition has been sanctioned for 1034 children to date in the current school year.  The 2009 budgetary allocation for the scheme is &euro;11 million.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that I have already reviewed this matter myself on foot of a detailed report received from the Residential Institutions Redress Unit of my Department.</P>
        <P>I sympathise very much with the position of the person referred to by the Deputy. I appreciate that in 1982 he approached the Department to advise it of the abuse he had suffered, and that the teacher who had abused him was still teaching in the school system. I acknowledge that the Department&rsquo;s handling of that complaint was grossly inappropriate and inadequate and I apologise to him for the manner in which that complaint was dealt with.</P>
        <P>I can imagine that it must have taken considerable courage on his part to come forward in the manner he did. This makes the handling of his complaint all the more unacceptable. While I sympathise very much with his position, I must inform you that there is no basis for changing the State&rsquo;s position with regard to his legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>The abuse in this case occurred in a primary school.  My Department was not aware of the abuse at the time it occurred and therefore could not have done anything to prevent it happening. It would not be fair or reasonable to hold my Department liable for acts or events of which it had no knowledge at the time, and which it could not have prevented.  For this reason my Department cannot accept liability in the matter.</P>
        <P>As you are no doubt aware, the State cannot be held vicariously liable for the actions of a teacher given that the State is not the employer of teachers in schools. This position has been supported by the recent judgement delivered in the O&rsquo;Keeffe case.</P>
        <P>The fact that his subsequent complaint was not properly dealt with, while completely unacceptable in terms of proper handling of complaints, cannot make the State liable for abuse which (at the time it occurred) the State was not aware of and so could not have prevented it.</P>
        <P>I have every sympathy for anybody who was the subject of child abuse.  In the circumstances however I regret to say that the State cannot accept liability in these particular proceedings.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s procedure for dealing with complaints of abuse are that all complaints are referred to the HSE which has statutory responsibility for dealing with such allegations. Similar procedures existed in the past. In the case of criminal investigations the Garda&iacute; are the appropriate authority and my Department&rsquo;s policy is to provide the Garda&iacute; with any papers or records they require.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware the issue of exchange of information in the context of child protection was considered by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  Following the receipt of the Committee&rsquo;s interim report the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in cooperation with Department Justice Equality and Law Reform colleagues, has commenced the process of preparing legislation in this area.  Further consideration will be given to the historic complaint files in my Department in that context.</P>
        <P>In relation to complaints made to the Commission as Minister for Education &amp; Science, I would have no access to individual complaints made to that body as the Commission is completely independent in the performance of its functions and most of the people who participated in the process did so on an entirely confidential basis.  I can tell you, however, that my Department co-operated fully with the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse in relation to the provision of documentation on foot of a number of Discovery Orders.</P>
