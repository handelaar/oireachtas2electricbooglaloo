	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance and concern; namely, the urgent need to support all cystic fibrosis patients in the State.  I welcome the opening of the nine en-suite beds at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and the recent granting of planning permission for a cystic fibrosis unit at Beaumont Hospital.  I call on the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste to ensure finance is made available to complete the national centre, which includes 34 en-suite rooms for cystic fibrosis patients at St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the House under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of local and national importance; namely, the inability of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to <Col N="3"/>provide transport for six MS sufferers travelling by wheelchair who had previously booked their passage from Tralee station to Heuston Station in order to receive respite care at Bushy Park for one week.  This disgraceful situation demands ministerial intervention to ensure the six MS sufferers have the same rights of transport as everyone else.  There can be no excuse for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s claim that it can provide facilities for only one wheelchair user on the Tralee to Dublin train.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il to address the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in conjunction with IDA Ireland and other relevant State agencies, to act with greater urgency to save the 1,100 jobs that will be lost if the closure of SR Technics at Dublin Airport is allowed to go ahead.  There is a need for expressions of interest in the operation to be dealt with directly by IDA Ireland and for the survival plan put forward by the workforce to be fully supported by Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 9b, motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No. 3, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2009 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 13, Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 9b shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 3 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 March 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three proposals to be put to the House today.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 9b without debate agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 3 agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to divide the House over the guillotine on this Bill, but the Labour Party Members are anxious that the House debate amendment No. 3 in the names of Deputies Ciar&aacute;n Lynch and Joanna Tuffy.  The purpose of the amendment is to give effect to the promises made by the Taoiseach at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is taking this Bill, at the Green Party conference last weekend that the maximum amount that can be donated to a political party will be reduced and that there will also be a reduction in the level at which contributions must be publicly declared.  The Labour Party is anxious that the House has the opportunity to debate this amendment so we can put into law the commitments given by the Taoiseach and the Minister and which the Labour Party supports.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will be able to give the House some comfort by assuring it there will be time to debate this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>If we can get our business completed as soon as possible we will have adequate time.  It should not be beyond our ability to get to amendment No. 3.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to be disruptive.  I am not sure how long it takes to fly back from Dallas but there is no reason that the D&aacute;il should not sit next Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  I acknowledge that our national festivities are important.  This is one of the few countries that have national days and I recognise that some Ministers have important responsibilities in international affairs, but the people want this House to be seen to be working effectively.  There is no reason that the D&aacute;il should not meet next Wednesday and Thursday and, accordingly, I disagree with the proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I object to the proposed recess.  The proposal is that the D&aacute;il will not meet again until 24 March, which is in 12 days time.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day comprises one day, not 12.  There is no justification for putting the D&aacute;il into recess for 12 days.  I am aware that historically it was difficult to arrange Government business during that week because virtually the entire Cabinet and every Minister of State went abroad on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  However, we are led to believe that such is not the case this year and that a considerably reduced number of Ministers is travelling to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events abroad.  It should be possible, therefore, to organise the business of the House around the Ministers who will be in the country.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s proposal on the recess is not unrelated to the fact that it is coming up appallingly short in terms of bringing legislation before the House.  The number of Bills enacted by this House last year was the smallest in a decade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot go into that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am setting out my reasons for objecting to the recess.  Business remains to be done.  Only four items of legislation have been enacted thus far this year.  Of the 18 Bills promised by the Government in this session, only one has been produced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is in the Chamber, promised five Bills last session but none was produced.  Six Bills have been on the Government legislative programme since 2003.  With the limited resources available to us, the Labour Party has published 16 Private Members&rsquo; Bills whereas the Government, despite all the State resources on which it can draw, cannot produce the legislation it has promised.  If the Government has no business for next week, we can deal with some of the 16 Bills the Labour Party has produced.</P>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in would welcome the scheduling of business on Wednesday and Thursday of next week if that is achievable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to legislation, eight Bills have been enacted thus far this year.  We are all aware that we are in unprecedented times and we have to deal with difficult and complex legislation.  Spokespersons on finance will be particularly familiar with the work involved in that regard.</P><Col N="5"/>
        <P>The Leader of the Opposition has noted that we are unique in having a particular day on which we can access several people of repute.  The Taoiseach will have an opportunity to meet the President of the United States following which he will attend the spring Council meeting.  If ever we had the need to deal with our international reputation and trade, it is certainly this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is for sure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the focus for everyone who will travel abroad.  On that basis, I am not in a position to accept the Opposition&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the D&aacute;il upon its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 March 2009.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>I was going to ask the T&aacute;naiste to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to send out an all points bulletin for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but I see he appeared for the vote.  I am glad he has graced us with his presence.</P>
      
        <P>Two weeks ago, the T&aacute;naiste said the public finances were under control.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach told us the budget would be introduced on 7 April.  What date does the Minister propose for the introduction of the Finance Bill that will give legal effect to the changes in the budget on 7 April?  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree the reason for having a budget and a finance Bill is that the public finances are not under control?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s interesting announcement of an amalgamation between TCD and UCD in the area of innovation.  It is a futuristic step and one we must certainly examine.  Arising from that, both university authorities have said they will be looking to the Government for changes in tax legislation dealing with relief for private equity to be put into research at third level, and in respect of adjustments for PhD personnel who remain in Ireland after graduating.  Has the Government contemplated what such legislation would mean?  Does the T&aacute;naiste have any idea when it might come before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There will be financial resolutions on budget day.  The finance Bill will be introduced in keeping with the traditions of this House.  I will not revert to an interview I did on RTE, but if the Deputy listened to the entire interview he might come to a different conclusion.</P><Col N="7"/>
        <P>As regards the issue concerning Trinity College and UCD, it is not an amalgamation, it is an alliance.  That alliance is based on the smart economy vision which was launched before Christmas to look at new opportunities for the economy and how this alliance has been formed through research and development co-operation.  A number of initiatives have been proposed by the university sector, which can be considered in the context of any budgetary decisions to be made.  I am sure the Minister for Finance will be more than happy to consider the Deputy&rsquo;s own budgetary proposals in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the T&aacute;naiste if she knew the date of the introduction of the finance Bill.  Obviously, if the budget is on 7 April, I assume there will be two or three days of discussion in the House.  The Minister for Finance will then have to introduce a Finance Bill at the end of April or in May.  The year is moving on and every hour that is wasted makes the situation more difficult, so when does the Government propose to introduce the Finance Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

	<P>Last night the Government voted down, by a margin of three votes, a Labour Party motion setting out eight specific proposals for dealing with the problems of people who are currently unemployed, with particular emphasis on the need for education and training services to be enhanced.  When the Government met the social partners in January, it promised that a jobs and skills summit would be convened in March.  Since the T&aacute;naiste has line responsibility for this matter, may I ask her when&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy could do so if this was Question Time, but it is not.  We have the same problem every week.  We cannot have Leaders&rsquo; Questions on Thursday mornings for the simple reason that there is no provision in Standing Orders for them.  Questions must comply with Standing Orders.  I have to implement them because the Members made them.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>This question is in order because I also want the T&aacute;naiste to tell us in what way the House will be involved in the jobs and skills summit she has promised for this month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>Now that the House has decided that it will only sit from 24 March, which leaves only one sitting week for the remainder of this month, I want to know when the <Col N="8"/>summit will be held.  Such a summit is obviously important, but when will it be convened?  How will the House be involved?</P>

        <P>Publication has been expected, and is eagerly anticipated, of legislation to amend the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 to provide for the establishment of a national bio-fuels obligation scheme.  It is also to provide for amendments to the Act in light of developments to facilitate NORA&rsquo;s ongoing activities.  If the Minister were in the House I am sure he would be willing to enlighten us further.  In the absence of the Minister, however, can the T&aacute;naiste indicate when NORA might appear in the House?  Has the necessary preparatory work been done?  This is important legislation which is part and parcel of the programme for Government.  I am seeking some clarification on that matter.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the estate management company legislation, about which there has been much confusion.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have previously given information to the House in this regard, but I am as confused now as before on where the legislation now stands.  Have the heads of the Bill been approved?  Will one Minister take total responsibility for it, or will a number of Ministers be involved?</P>
        <P>The last matter I wish to raise relates to the transposition into Irish law of the third money laundering directive.  Some considerable concerns have been expressed about money laundering recently.  It might be a good idea if the T&aacute;naiste could give the House an indication when this will be finalised.</P>

	<P>May I remind the T&aacute;naiste that the recession has caused grievous problems for the financial situation of a sizeable group of vulnerable people whose funds are <Col N="10"/>lodged in court and they can neither access nor manage them.  Following a Law Reform Commission report on vulnerable adults, legislation was promised in this area.  Will the T&aacute;naiste address this matter urgently with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward this legislation?  Hundreds of people, perhaps more, are in a financial situation where they have lost all their money in investments due to the current financial crisis.  In response to a parliamentary question on the matter, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed me he has no function in the matter, which is most regrettable.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a most important issue.  I have been refused by your office, a Cheann Comhairle, an opportunity to raise this matter in the D&aacute;il.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There must have been a good reason for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation could be resolved if the promised legislation, the mental capacity Bill, were introduced as a matter of urgency.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure it is expedited at the earliest opportunity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The mental capacity Bill will be published this year.  As I understand, the matter to which the Deputy referred will not come under the Bill&rsquo;s remit.  If it is a matter of concern, perhaps the Deputy could discuss it with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill should not be delayed for another year.  The legislation has already been drafted by the Law Reform Commission.

Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate if the Government will make time available for the House to scrutinise any revised budget or service plan relating to the HSE, particularly in view of the fact that public moneys are involved and that Members are responsible for the voting of those moneys to that organisation?  There must be direct accountability with regard to the delivery of health care in this State.

	<P>In light of the disastrous experience we had with the digital hub, is it proposed to amend the legislation that governs the universities, the Higher Education Authority or Science Foundation Ireland in order to make provision for the funding of scientific research across the broad spectrum of third level institutions?  Reports appear to indicate that the mistake that was made in respect of the digital hub &mdash; when significant scientific funding for the third level sector was removed &mdash; is possibly about to be repeated.  Is it planned to introduce legislation in respect of universities, the Higher Education Authority or Science Foundation Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 3, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) by inserting the following after subparagraph (ix)&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">&ldquo;(x) expenditure incurred in preparing or publishing material on the internet, where the material was published prior to the period during which election expenses are to be calculated under this Act.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The purpose of this amendment is to deal with what might be termed either an anomaly or an oversight in the Bill.  I am of the view that expenditure relating to material published on the Internet would have to be either included or excluded during election periods.  A situation might arise where the costs relating to an entire website might be inappropriately included in a candidate&rsquo;s election spending.  As the Minister is aware, many websites of this nature have been in operation for years and contain massive archives of material, which would relate to matters far more wide-ranging in scope than elections.  I ask him to consider accepting the amendment in order that candidates would not be obliged to pay huge sums of money which might prevent them from seeking election.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="15"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for tabling this amendment.  As he stated, it relates to material published on the Internet and would effectively exempt any material published on the Internet prior to the coming into effect of the spending limit period from being counted as election expenditure.  I appreciate the intention behind the amendment, but I do not propose to accept it.</P>
        <P>It might be of assistance if I was to clarify what are considered election expenses for the purposes of making a spending declaration at a local election.  Section 6(1) of the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 defines election expenses as meaning &ldquo;all expenditure for electoral purposes incurred on the provision of property, goods or services for use at an election&rdquo;.  This definition relates to expenditure incurred during the spending period.  Under the revised provisions being introduced in section 4, the election period will be set by ministerial order.  This period will commence between 50 and 60 days prior to polling day and end on that day.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has tabled further amendments on this matter in respect of newspaper advertising.  The 1999 Act lists election expenses as those expenses relating to advertising &mdash; whatever medium used &mdash; publicity, election posters, other election material, office and stationery, transport and travel, market research and campaign workers.  Use of the Internet as an advertising medium would currently come within the definition of what are considered election expenses.  In its guidance to candidates before the 2007 general election, for example, the Standards in Public Office Commission listed website design as a typical expense reported in returns by candidates under the heading of advertising.  Other office related costs associated with the use of the Internet in election campaigning would also count as an expense.  These might include, for example, the purchase or rental of office equipment or telephone costs.  These are mentioned again the Schedule of the 1999 Act.</P>
        <P>If I understand the Deputy correctly, the objective of the amendment is to ensure that material which has long been available on the Internet in advance of the election and continues to be available during the election spending period is not automatically counted as election spending.  Obviously, there is some merit in that view but the amendment might allow too much of an exemption.  There are some very sophisticated websites putting out archive material and material that, perhaps, has been distributed throughout the constituency.  That undoubtedly must count as advertising.  It is often difficult to calculate the monetary value of that.  I have discussed this with my officials.  It is fair to point out that if the website has been constructed and designed before the spending period, that is a normal cost that has been incurred before that period.</P>
        <P>What we are discussing here specifically is, for example, a candidate who has significantly revamped his or her website as an election campaign tool in the days before the spending limit period commences and has tried to avoid having that included in his or her spending declaration.  That person could publish a wide range of electoral materials for use in active campaigning over the election period and avoid having to declare the expenditure.  A similar point could be made about uploaded material for broadcast on the website.  The effect of the amendment also would be to create a significant difference in the definition of election expenses for local elections as compared to election expenses for D&aacute;il and other elections.  There are difficulties with this and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his extensive explanation and I thank his officials for taking the time to examine this matter.  I realise that a website can be put in place specifically for the election period alone, which could be costed entirely as election expenditure.  However, where there are previous press releases or even the loading of current press releases during the duration of a campaign, this creates certain anomalies.  I would be happy to withdraw the amendment if the Minister and his staff were prepared to give this matter further consideration when the Bill is brought to the Seanad.  Nobody in the House wants a situation where an <Col N="16"/>oversight or something that happens during the election campaign creates a cost that was not intended in the first place.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to accommodate the Deputy in that regard.  However, perhaps we should address this issue through guidelines on the implementation and interpretation of the legislation.  It is clear that many candidates will want to know exactly what they can and cannot do.  My Department will work on those guidelines and ensure there is clarity in that regard as far as candidates are concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 4, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;and</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(c) by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (11):</P>
        <P LI="4" el="5">&ldquo;(12) Where a political party incurs expenses and payments under this section as amended by the <i>Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009</i> on a local election to which that Act applies and in particular to which Part IIIA of this Act as inserted by that Act applies, then for the year in which such local election is held and in each year until the following such election, that political party may not accept any donation exceeding &euro;4,000 per year from any one donor and shall declare any donation exceeding &euro;2,500 per year from any one donor.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is a significant amendment.  While amendment No. 1 was ruled out of order and questionably ruled outside the scope of the Bill, this amendment is certainly within its scope.  The motivation for the amendment came from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s address at his party&rsquo;s recent Ard-Fheis.  He spoke about reducing the amounts and disclosure limits for political parties.  He said the Government, and I assume he was referring to all parties in the Government, wishes to go further as part of the ongoing reform programme which the Government is undertaking in this area.  He said the Government would be proposing a major reduction in both the levels at which donations to national political parties must be disclosed and in the maximum allowable donations.  Specifically, he said it would propose the halving of the declaration limit from just over &euro;5,000 per year to &euro;2,500 and the maximum allowable donation would fall from roughly &euro;6,500 per year to &euro;4,000 per year.</P>
        <P>The amendment tabled by me and Deputy Tuffy carries out the intention of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement that evening.  To assist the Minister and to keep the amendment in order, we drafted it to limit it to donations to parties that contest local elections, but that would cover the substance of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment.  If the Minister wishes to broaden its coverage to all parties, an instruction to the D&aacute;il in committee could be passed to allow this.  However, that is the Minister&rsquo;s prerogative; it is not in the gift of the Opposition.</P>
        <P>This suggestion has been made by the Taoiseach and the Labour Party agrees with it.  The Taoiseach, when he spoke, gave the impression that he was speaking on behalf of the Government on this matter.  The Bill is before the House today and I do not see any other mechanism by which the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intentions can be turned into legislation.  The Labour Party has facilitated the Taoiseach and the Government with this amendment and I seek the support of all parties for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 fixes a limit of &euro;6,349 as the maximum donation that may be accepted by a political party <Col N="17"/>in any given year from any one source.  The Electoral Act 1997, as amended, provides that political parties must disclose donations of more than &euro;5,079 in any given year.  The Labour Party amendment is intended to reduce these amounts to &euro;4,000 as the maximum permissible donation in the context of local elections and &euro;2,500 in respect of disclosure.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy pointed out, the Taoiseach made comments on this matter at his party&rsquo;s Ard-Fheis.  He also will be aware that I made specific commitments at my party&rsquo;s Ard-Fheis.  Both of us are speaking for the Government.  It is absolutely necessary to overhaul the legislation and to provide legal clarity on these matters.  This Bill emanated from a commitment in the programme for Government.  It was not a very clear commitment but we said that the Green Paper would examine these matters.  Some doubt was cast on my commitment to delivering the legislation before the House today but we are now delivering it.  The Deputy said he would welcome this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I have welcomed it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and we have delivered it.  What I promised last weekend will be also delivered.  It will be radical legislation.  What we are discussing today is legislation that stems from legislation produced by the Deputy&rsquo;s party when it was in Government.  We are now going further than that and we will go further again.  That will be separate legislation because we are examining not only the amounts that can be given to parties but also what can be spent between elections and the source of those donations.  Should we be taking money from the big corporations?  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I said that at the weekend.  I want to deal with the issue in a very clear way.  Therefore, I want the legislation we are discussing today to be a stand-alone Bill.</P>
        <P>There are some technical difficulties I should point out to the Deputy regarding the text of his amendment.  As I see it, it is proposed to insert the new provision relating to donations in the part of the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 that deals with expenses and payments at elections and not in the part that deals with donations.  There are some difficulties in that regard but more fundamentally the proposal is made without reference to the existing provisions of both the 1999 Act and the Electoral Act 1997, which deal with limits on donations to and disclosures by political parties.  Deputy Lynch need not have any fear in regard to this matter.  It will be delivered upon in separate legislation which will be radical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister seems to be bringing us all around the House on this matter.  He is going from 2009 to 1999 and 1997.  We are well aware that when Deputy Howlin was the Minister in 1997 substantial changes were made, which were subsequently diluted and diminished by his successor, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when a whole range of provisions that would have facilitated electoral control were undermined at that time.  The excuse of the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was that it was a cumbersome, bureaucratic exercise and we should not approach it.  I welcome the ground the Minister has made up on the issue since he came to office approximately two years ago, but the issue has been before the House for a long time.  The Minister spoke about it before he arrived in Cabinet.</P>
        <P>I do not accept what the Minister said about legal clarities and technical difficulties.  Two things in particular arise in regard to the issue.  The amendment is not outside the scope of the Act and while the Minister accepts it is a good idea, he is saying &ldquo;not just yet&rdquo;.  I will be pressing the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
        <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I again offer my assurances to the Deputy that this legislation deals with specific matters relating to local elections.  We had to get the Bill to the House as quickly as possible because we have to comply with the 60-day rule, which is part of the legislation.  I want to come forward with more comprehensive legislation, which will overhaul the system <Col N="18"/>and deal with the issues I spoke about at my Ard-Fheis at the weekend.  It will be radical legislation and it will do exactly what I have set out.  He need not have any fear about that.  Obviously, if he wishes to press the amendment that is fine, but he should not interpret the vote on it as in any way not accepting the principle behind the amendment because there is no question about it &mdash; we will do what the Taoiseach said initially and what I have said subsequently.</P>

        <P>Section 3 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION  4.</P>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 5, line 4, to delete &ldquo;shall incur&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may apply to their election expenses&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We have put forward this amendment in order to ensure consistency with other sections of the Bill.  We suggest a change in the wording to &ldquo;may apply&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall incur&rdquo;.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister has to say on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Flanagan and his colleagues, Deputies Hogan and Bannon, for bringing forward this amendment.  It may be beneficial for me to outline in greater detail the intention behind the provision contained in section 4, which deals with the allocation of a portion of the candidate&rsquo;s spending limit for the use of the national agent or political party.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As is the case with D&aacute;il and other election codes, the spending limits for local elections will apply to individual candidates in the first instance.  However, unlike the spending limits that operate for other electoral codes, candidates nominated by a political party will be deemed to automatically allocate 10% of their spending limits for use by the party&rsquo;s national agent at a national level.  For example, a party candidate with a limit of &euro;7,500 would be deemed to automatically allocate &euro;750 for use by his or her party.  There is provision, however, to allow this figure to be varied upwards or downwards by written agreement between a candidate and the national agent of his or her political party.  The maximum the national agent of the party can spend will be the sum of the amounts allocated by the individual candidates.  This can be spent nationally or within an electoral area.  The national agent can also authorise a designated person locally to incur a portion of the expenditure that has been allocated to him or her.</P>

        <P>Under the current arrangements for D&aacute;il elections, when candidates allocate a portion of their limit for use by the national agent of their party, this must be done in writing.  Given the number of candidates involved in the local elections, this approach would create significant administrative difficulties.  It would be unwieldy to the point of being inoperable.  A position will, therefore, apply whereby 10% of the candidate&rsquo;s limit will be deemed to be allocated for use by the national agent.  This will allow sufficient latitude for political parties to fund their election campaigns at local elections.  There is also the option to vary the amount but this would have to be done in writing.  It is envisaged that the written agreements would follow a similar form to those used for general elections when a candidate or his or her agent can apportion part of the spending limit to the national agent of his or her party.</P>
        <P>The wording of the Bill, as it stands, achieves the objectives I have set out and has been approved by the Parliamentary Counsel.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I believed I understood what he was saying but I am sorry to say I became increasingly confused.  Perhaps he will clarify his comments further.  I understand from the section that it is assumed in respect of local elections that 10% of the spend of an individual candidate will be spent by one&rsquo;s political party.  However, as the section seems to state in the alternative, if one&rsquo;s political party is not to be taken as spending 10% on one, there could be a written agreement whereby it would spend nothing on one, or more than 10%.  This is what I understood the Minister to have said <Col N="20"/>initially but, as he continued, I gathered that, irrespective of whether the party spends 10% on one, it is to be taken as having done such.  I am somewhat confused about what the Minister is saying.</P>
        <P>I want to broaden the discussion on this provision and its interaction with the section.  I have a major concern about this legislation, particularly about this section and what the Minister is doing in respect thereof.  My concern is that it has become politically correct to take the view that it is invidious for people to spend money at election time on putting across their or their party&rsquo;s policies to the electorate, and that expenditure in this regard should be curtailed substantially.  It is politically correct to be of the view that it should be curtailed as much as possible.</P>
        <P>This Bill is presented as a reforming measure.  I fully accept the need, as outlined in the Bill, for transparency with regard to donations and I do not want to be misunderstood on that point.  I have a very simple personal political view, which reflects the view of Fine Gael, that there should be transparency with regard to donations.  I would not mind if this applied to every &euro;5 received as a donation but this would become ridiculous and the bureaucracy and administration involved would make it untenable.  I presume the figures that are fixed in this context tend to allow people to privately contribute small sums to political parties or individuals and seek to ensure that, where one tries to contribute a larger sum, transparency will apply and that no one can contribute more than a particular sum.</P>
        <P>My concern is not about the freedom people should have to contribute to political parties.  It is absolutely reasonable that there be a limit on how much businesses or individuals can contribute.  However, too many politicians across the board in this House and the Government are falling into the trap of confusing the maximum any individual should be allowed to contribute by way of a political donation with the maximum that could or should be spent on an individual candidate.  This section addresses this issue and lays down maximums.  The amendment concerns a fraction of the maximum spend that is to be attributed to the local party.</P>
        <P>Why is this a problem?  It is because we live in what purports to be a parliamentary democracy.  We have a constitutional provision that allows people the rights of freedom of expression and freedom to associate.  The very essence of elections is that individuals have the capacity to communicate directly with the electorate, unfiltered by the media, to put across their policies and personal positions, thereby allowing themselves to be identified as candidates in the eyes of the electorate.  Thus, the electorate can understand the individuals&rsquo; associations with their political parties and, if the candidates are independent, the electorate can be made aware of this.  Ultimately, it is a question of the electorate getting to know about the person it might vote for and the policies he or she supports.  That is the very essence of a constitutional democracy, regardless of whether one is an independent candidate in a local election or a general election or whether one is a member of a large party or, as is the case with the Minister, a small party.</P>
        <P>We are doing damage to our parliamentary democracy for the sake of political correctness.  It is a form of political correctness that is, to some extent, being supported by certain journalists within the media who never stand for election and who have an opinion on everything but are not accountable for anything.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The limits and the legislative measures prescribed in this section uniquely serve the parties in Government on the occasion of an election, and particularly serve the parties in Government during local elections.  It is blindingly obvious why I am saying this.  It is a question of limiting the spend of an individual candidate on trying to get his message across when standing for democratic election.  What will happen during the course of the forthcoming local elections?  Will the Government stop issuing press releases?  Will the myriad of consultants, advisers and <Col N="21"/>personal attendants associated with the offices of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and all the other Ministers stop issuing press statements and documents about Government policy?  Will they be limited on their spend?  Will the public relations spin doctors, on whom the Government, including the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has spent millions, take a vow of silence in the 60-day or 90-day period before the local elections?  Will they stop spinning the benefit of so-called Government policy initiatives?  Will they stop giving Ministers advice on how to get across to the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am loth to interrupt the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming back specifically to the limits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to give the Deputy latitude.  We will have a discussion on the section but, for this element of the debate, I ask the Deputy to focus narrowly on the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come back to this.  My point is directly relevant to the amendment.  Will Ministers stop using taxpayers&rsquo; money to pay public relations consultancies to help them spin their message to the specific advantage of local election candidates running for those Ministers&rsquo; parties?  Of course they will not.</P>
        <P>In the context of this section, what percentage of the spend incurred by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the two-month or three-month lead-in to the local elections, when he is trying to persuade people of the great merit of the policies he is implementing, will be attached to the spend of every Green Party candidate in the local elections to delimit the personal expenditure they can incur?  The answer is none of it.  What the Government wants &mdash; it suits it in the context of the current environment of political correctness where we live in a democracy but engaging in democratic activity which is not filtered by the national media is apparently a reserved sin &mdash; is to curtail the capacity of the candidates of the parties that oppose it or independent candidates to communicate directly to the electorate in the lead-in to the local elections their critique of Government and alternative message and policies.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could decide two or three weeks prior to polling day in the local elections to hold a press conference to unveil some new environmental initiative the Government purports to take.  Presumably this press conference would be organised with all of the consultancy and PR advice at the Minister&rsquo;s disposal to produce yet another glossy document to lie on the shelves of Government offices gathering dust and which would be forgotten after the election.  Would the Minister&rsquo;s spend on this be factored in to what is being spent on Green Party local government candidates?  It would not.</P>
        <P>However, should a Fine Gael candidate in the local elections want to respond to this and put leaflets through doors to state the Minister&rsquo;s announcement was made four times previously, that the Government does not have the money to carry out the proposal and that it is an election gimmick, the Fine Gael candidate would be constrained financially in the cost of printing the leaflets or in their distribution if there were not sufficient volunteers to distribute them.  If the candidate wanted to distribute them with speed because the Minister decided to hold that press conference three days prior to polling day and had to pay a professional organisation to distribute the leaflets, he or she would be stopped from doing so.</P><Col N="22"/>
        <P>We are damaging the very fabric and foundations of our democracy under the guise of political correctness.  This is a pretence at curtailing expenditure from candidates because the view is that very rich people or people who get more financial support than others should not be allowed to use it to get their messages across.  By the time this Government is finished there will not be a rich person left in the country because of the economic disaster it created.  However, one of the touchstones of political popularity and electoral support, in circumstances where rightly the donations that can be given by individuals are limited and where there is transparency with regard to donations, is the extent to which an individual manages to raise finance from other persons to support his or her campaign.</P>
        <P>How many people in this House celebrated the success of the Obama campaign in raising funds by way of small donations in the 18 month lead-in to the United States presidential election?  We thought that was a good thing.  Looking at the disasters of the Bush Administration, some of us in this House silently cheered on Obama, as did others more vocally.  He could not, under our democratic system, have run in a local election and raised any funds that were meaningful.</P>
        <P>Let us be straightforward about this, a candidate who has limited capacities and abilities and not an original idea in his or her head will spend exactly the same money as a brighter candidate who has an original idea and a real message to get across.  This is not democracy.  I suggest to the Minister that whereas it is perfectly acceptable to require transparency of donations and to limit the amount of individual donations &mdash; although there could be some constitutional issues in regard to this &mdash; a major constitutional issue is raised with regard to curtailing an individual candidate in a democratic election in a parliamentary democracy in the amount of money he or she can spend from small donations raised to put across his or her message and to seek electoral support.</P>
        <P>These issues have not yet been dealt with by our courts and they should be because this is wrong-headed.  I am concerned that if there is supposed to be a compulsory party political spend identified within a candidate&rsquo;s expenditure, a large lump of it should be extracted from the spend of Government as it spins its way into the next election.  This Bill is designed to disadvantage  candidates from any party, not only from Fine Gael, who might want to oppose Government policy, get themselves elected and have the freedom to get their messages across.</P>
        <P>We all know normal people from outside this House &mdash; none of us as politicians is entirely sane or normal; if we were we would do something different with our lives.  We are obsessed by the minutiae of politics.  We read it and talk about it and contribute to it to a point of complete and utter insanity.  I suspect everyone in this House requires psychotherapy &mdash; I include myself in this &mdash; with regard to our obsession with the minutiae of politics.  Ordinary people getting on with their lives are not that obsessed.  Ordinary people facing major economic struggles have other issues that are more important to them and when it comes to an election one must grab their attention.  If there is a message, one must repeat it and if one wants to connect with them one must make an effort to do so.  In this modern age this requires funding.</P>
        <P>I apologise for the length of my contribution but this is a serious issue.  This is not a technical debate on a Bill which is okay financially.  It has been already guillotined at one point and will be guillotined again at 1.30 p.m.  This is about the very fabric of our democracy and the Minister is threatening to travel in a similar direction on D&aacute;il elections.  If he does, he should be challenged in the courts and the President should refer the Bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution.  I suspect that if this Bill were so referred, it could produce some very interesting judgments from the Supreme Court.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>To what extent has the Minister obtained a detailed opinion from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on whether this type of curtailing on spend as opposed to the raising of funds is damaging and possibly unconstitutional?  To what extent has he considered or investigated whether it violates international treaties on human rights and political activities?  We need to rethink where we are going with these types of limits in these circumstances.  The Minister, before he got his anatomy into Cabinet on a seemingly permanent basis regardless of what disasters fall about his shoulders, may have discovered during past elections as the Green Party struggled to get a message across, that the party was overwhelmed by the type of communications that derived from Governments during the course of election campaigns, including those for local elections.  The reason the Minister is there is not because too many people know anything about the detail of Green Party policies, it is because the green concept is a brand.  Correctly, people are now environmentally conscious.  People used to get &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;used to get&rdquo; &mdash; a warm feeling in their tummies when they heard the Green Party existed and they hoped it might do something to improve the environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is well outside the scope of the amendment at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of their experience of the Green Party in Government, I suspect they are suffering from a considerable amount of political indigestion.  It may well be that the reason the Minister is anxious to ensure there is an uneven playing pitch in the local government elections is that he can, from on high in his Department, issue policy documents and advocate implicatory support for his Green Party candidates while he will be on a high moral platform curtailing the extent to which candidates of other parties can attack the shibboleths and misrepresentations made by him on behalf of his own candidates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shatter has raised a very valid point.  These issues are never straightforward.  One of the problems with bringing the Bill before the House so late in the day is that we cannot properly tease them out.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter has raised some valid concerns.  There is an issue with Government machinery and taxpayers&rsquo; money being used to promote Government parties.  It is done in many different ways.  I can recall departmental advertising campaigns that would use the Minister to front such campaigns.  This is wrong.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is running a campaign to raise awareness on climate change, at a cost of &euro;5 million per year, but there is an element to this campaign that is about promoting the Green Party and its brand, as Deputy Shatter pointed out.  The Green Party has branded itself on the issue of climate change.  There are ethical issues to this.  The Green Party should take these issues on board as much as the Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if we could focus on the amendment at this stage.  We can talk about the section after we have dealt with the amendment to the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shatter was allowed to make some points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I was going to qualify it.  Things are never black and white.  The Minister seems to think that one has to agree with him entirely, or else one is against him.  That is not the way it is.</P><Col N="24"/>
        <P>There are complications in respect of the alternative.  If we were to do what Deputy Shatter is proposing and we did not bring in these kinds of limits, then people could spend much more in a local election than they could for a defined period in respect of a general election.  Therefore, an anomaly already exists.  I have run in local election campaigns where the candidates have spent more on local elections than the limits prescribed here.  They have had jeeps painted with their names and they have handed out products at schools and train stations.  They have plastered themselves all over billboards and have spent an obscene amount of money.  Only certain candidates can do this.  We should limit the spending of rich people and people with access to the support of corporations.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter raises a valid point, but I do not agree with him entirely.  We need to take on board the issues he is raising.  Will the Government promote itself at the next election?  During the last general election, we had to cost the Oireachtas envelopes we used and we had to repay the State for that.  However, the Government can use whatever machinery it likes during the local elections, and it will not be costed.  Even though it might promote its candidates, that will not come into this expenditure at all.  If we had more time to deal with this Bill, we could have teased out the issues and try to insert provisions to deal with those problems.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party still supports these expenditure limits.  It is a relief to most candidates to see expenditure limited for some of the time.  Spending money on elections eventually brings diminishing returns.  I accept that there is statistical information about the more money spent bringing more votes, but one finds that money starts going down the drain as people begin to ignore the billboards, the photographs in bus shelters and so on.</P>
        <P>This Bill contains good provisions but Deputy Shatter has raised valid issues about the Government&rsquo;s use of its own resources to promote the political parties within that Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been very interesting contributions to the debate on this amendment.  I agree with Deputy Shatter that politicians are not quite normal.  Many of us here have a degree of dysfunction.  We will not go there, but we will have to talk about it some other time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be an idea.  Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s contribution today was like a Second Stage speech, something at variance with what his Fine Gael colleague gave yesterday, who welcomed the Bill.  Deputy Shatter seems to have a principled objection, and he claims that the Fine Gael Party has adopted his position.  That is interesting, because Fine Gael abstained on the last vote and on the Labour Party amendment, which seems to be following his line.</P>
        <P>I told Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch that I agreed in principle with what he was saying, and that we will introduce those limits.  However, the Fine Gael Party is telling us this morning that it objects in principle to imposing them.  I understand Deputy Shatter perfectly well.  He has made himself very clear.  He stated that candidates ought to be able to spend as much money to get their message across.  In other words, he is saying that we should have the best democracy that money can buy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>But the Minister wants the best democracy the Government can buy.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="25"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy then talks about the Green Party, but we should look at the facts.  An excellent document was prepared for the joint committee on this and it showed the spending of the various political parties.  Which political party spent the least amount of money?  The Deputy is now trying to make out that Fine Gael and its members are going around like church mice.  If he looked at the individual spending of candidates, he will see that some of the Fine Gael candidates at the last local election painted the town with the amount of money they spent.  I find that disagreeable, because those candidates have an incredible advantage.  I do not know where they get the money &mdash; they may be wealthy themselves &mdash; but they use it to put out leaflet after leaflet, while others who do not have that money cannot compete.  We are trying to have a level playing pitch here.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter spoke about President Obama and the small donations he received.  President Obama also got huge donations from major companies.  Deputy Shatter gave the impression that Fine Gael was supporting President Obama, but there are many of his younger, more right wing colleagues who supported Mr. McCain.  That is their democratic right.</P>

        <P>We are trying to set certain limits and adopt a common sense approach.  It is not political correctness gone mad, but is simply looking for an even playing pitch.  I am glad to say that the Labour Party agrees with the principles we are enunciating.  The party asked me to bring forward this Bill.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter asked me whether I got legal advice.  Of course I did but it is a little bit over the top to suggest that we are in breach of international treaties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I will briefly respond.  I listened with great interest to what the Minister said.  He studiously avoided addressing the issue, which is about the amount of money spent by the Government and by his Department to get across his party&rsquo;s policies and his Government&rsquo;s policies in the lead in to a local election.  This is not about an even playing pitch.  It is not about the best democracy money can buy.  It is about the best democracy the Government can buy, and the best democracy the Government can control.  This is a serious issue.  We need to debate it.  There will come a time when the Minister will not be sitting on that side of the House, and this issue may strike him as being relevant.</P>
        <P>One aspect struck me.  A comment from my colleague, Deputy Terence Flanagan, brought it to mind and perhaps the Minister could provide the House with some assurances concerning the matter.  I find it difficult not to laugh when I refer to it but, at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, a unique political event, the well known reporter Mr. David Davin-Power appeared on the <Col N="26"/>&ldquo;Nine O&rsquo;Clock News&rdquo; with a group of individuals who have been described, rather unkindly, as zombies.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 5, between lines 48 and 49, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(4) In this section, &lsquo;population&rsquo; means population as ascertained by the Central Statistics Office in the census report setting out the final result of the most recent census of population.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As previously indicated on Second Stage, for the 2009 local elections population data from the 2006 census report is being used as the basis for determining the spending limits in county and city council electoral areas.  To avoid ambiguity in future elections, the amendment will specify that the population data used in setting spending limits will be from the census report setting out the final result of the most recent census of population.  A key factor which must be considered in setting expenditure limits is the diversity which exists throughout local government in Ireland in terms of the different type of local authority, the numbers of members elected in each area and the respective population figures for those areas.</P>
        <P>Given that they are the primary units of local government, there is a case for treating county and city councils differently from borough and town councils.  Differences in population, especially at the level of electoral area, suggest different spending limits should be set to reflect this situation.  Data on expenditure of previous elections also points to higher spending in more populous areas.  Having spending limits for county and city councils based on population is the most equitable way to proceed.  However, to achieve consistency in the application of the spending limits in future, it is important that the scheme of limits takes account of the fact that shifts in population will occur.  If the population of an area increases, it is important that allowance is made to revise the spending limits in that area where appropriate.  To provide clarity, I specify in the amendment that the population used in determining the limits would be based on the final result of the most recent census of population.  That is the most appropriate way of doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the amendment and the move to the census reports.  However, the issue of the link between the personal public service number, PPSN, registration system and the register of electors must be attended to, because the register of electors and the census figures for given areas are showing great disparities throughout the country.  In some cases, there are more people on the register of electors than there are people reported in the census.  I hope this measure goes somewhat towards clearing up that difficulty.  Fundamentally, the elephant in the room is the PPSN issue and that must be addressed.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 6, line 1, to delete &ldquo;50&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;182&rdquo;.</P><Col N="28"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">On behalf of the Labour Party, I moved a Private Members&rsquo; Bill more than one year ago on the issue of electoral spending.  Earlier in his address, I note the Minister mentioned and gave credit to the Labour Party as the party which has consistently called for this move and that it has been a driving force on this issue throughout the years.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation from the Minister, but there is an issue with regard to the running of elections.  General elections are a matter of fate, determination or decision, whereas local elections are on a five-year schedule.  The date of the next local elections is predictable.  Whether one is a sitting councillor or an incumbent, it is likely that candidates for the next local elections will be in the field in approximately two or three years time, because project management of local elections has become of this fashion.  Hence, there is extensive spending during these periods.</P>
        <P>I refer to Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s earlier remarks.  All the research shows that there is a clear correlation and connection that money spent on elections determines the outcome.  The report compiled by the Oireachtas Library for the Oireachtas Select Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a copy of which was provided to the Minister, highlights numerous such examples.  The purpose of the amendment tabled by the Labour Party is to adjust the time line.  I accept that given that local elections are to be held this year, something had to be done and some structure had to be in place for these elections.  However, I believe we need a longer time line to monitor expenditures.</P>
        <P>To some extent, such a provision is to the benefit of a candidate, because it does not allow a situation where people with extensive resources and a great deal of finance available to them are able to frontload their advertising before the scheduled date from which the expenditure is accounted.  I call on the Minister to revise his opinion on this issue, to extend the duration of the period in which costs can be accounted for and to take on board the Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment attempts to extend the parameters within which the Minister makes the order setting the spending limit period.  Bearing in mind the proximity of the forthcoming local elections, 60 days is the maximum period that can be realistically set for the 2009 elections.  This period effectively will be more than double that currently for D&aacute;il and European Parliament elections.  It also will be more than double the period for which local election spending had to be declared under the current provisions in the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999.</P>
        <P>Under the Electoral Act 1997, which provides for spending limits at European Parliament, presidential and D&aacute;il elections, the commencement of the spending period is determined by reference, in the case of a D&aacute;il general election, to the date of dissolution of the D&aacute;il; in the case of a D&aacute;il by-election, to the date of the issue of the writ; and in the case of a European Parliament or presidential election, the date of the order appointing polling day at the election.  The end of the spending period in the case of all of the three categories of election is polling day at the relevant election.</P>
        <P>The reason parameters are set for the Minister in the Bill in setting the spending limit period is to ensure policy is set in primary legislation.  If no upper or lower parameter was set, the Minister of the day would effectively have an unfettered ability to set the spending limit period by order and could, in theory, act against the spirit of the legislation.  The parameters, as they are set out in the Bill, allow for a spending limit period of between 50 and 60 days.  This is a marked improvement on the current arrangements.</P><Col N="29"/>
        <P>There is also a significant difficulty with the amendment, as presented.  The effect of the amendment would be to retrospectively commence the spending limit period and declare that it commenced some time last year.  Fairness in the treatment of election candidates demands that they be given notice of the rules and regulations with which they must comply at an election in advance of them coming into force.  This is especially the case when the potential for prosecution and criminal sanction can result.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter alluded to the possibility of challenges being made to the legislation before the courts.  Acceptance of the amendment would result in the introduction of a retrospective rule and criminal sanction for breaching it.  As the amendment is legally unsound, we must exercise care in this matter.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no legal difficulty with the amendments, nor do problems arise in the context of retrospection.  While I accept this is new legislation and its implementation in the coming months will give rise to difficulties, it is in the nature of legislation that minor difficulties and anomalies will emerge.</P>
        <P>The fundamental principle arising from the amendments is whether the Minister is prepared to sign up to the concept that electoral expenditure should be contained.  Some speakers appeared to indicate they do not sign up to this position.  If one accepts the principle of spending limits, it is not realistic to believe electoral expenditure will be confined to election periods.  Candidates spend money on local elections long before they take place.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate the Minster&rsquo;s decision to establish a 60 day mechanism, the reason for its introduction is the delay in bringing the legislation before the House.  The Bill was introduced yesterday afternoon and will go out the door at 1.30 p.m.  By any measure, it is rushed, crisis-driven legislation.  The reason for the crisis has been the delay in bringing it to the House.</P>
        <P>Should legal questions arise, it will be as a result of the insufficient time provided to examine and scrutinise the Bill.  Government sequencing of legislation rather than proposals made by the Opposition are the problem.  I ask the Minister to consider the issues I have raised and accept the amendment.  Failing that, I will press the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to clarify one aspect of the section.  The Bill introduces a number of expenditure limits, which reduce based on a perception of constituency sizes and other factors.  I am interested in the thought process which produced these figures.  Why was an expenditure limit of &euro;15,000 rather than &euro;20,000 or &euro;12,000 selected?  Has a mystical measure of which I am unaware been used to determine this ideal expenditure of a candidate?  What elements were factored in to arriving at this determination?</P>
        <P>Was a calculation done of the number of leaflets a candidate may have printed at a particular cost?  Is it no longer acceptable for candidates to have posters on lamp posts?  If not, was a <Col N="30"/>costing done of how many types of posters could be used or whether such posters should be in colour print or black and white?  Did anyone factor in the cost to a candidate who takes his or her own photographs for his or her posters or has them done by friends or relations?  Has a costing been done for a professional photographer?</P>
        <P>What is the position when supporters of a candidate have a picture of a candidate erected in their gardens?  Has a costing been done of the wood one would have to pay for to erect such a presentation?  While I have not engaged in this practice, a number of candidates appear to believe having such displays in gardens is a good idea.  I would prefer to see tulips and daffodils growing than see pictures of candidates emerging from behind garden walls, which some people may find scary late at night.  How was the figure arrived at?</P>
        <P>What is the position regarding a candidate who may not benefit from the media assistance frequently available to members of large and even small parties?  An independent candidate with a good idea who needs help to get it across may need help to deal with the searching questions he or she will be asked should he or she be fortunate enough to do something of such vital national interest as to end up on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or something so daft as to end up on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; with Joe Duffy.  He or she may need to be careful about how to approach the issues.  To what extent has this been factored in to the calculations?</P>
        <P>Has consideration been given, for example, to a media savvy candidate, perhaps someone who has been involved in the broadcasting world, possibly as a journalist, and has media expertise?  Why is the expenditure limit of such candidates not reduced by a certain percentage to take account of their media expertise and training?  Presumably if a candidate receives some form of media training within the period designated in the section, this cost will form part of his or her expenditure.  Perhaps that will not be the case.</P>
        <P>I am curious about how we got to these magical figures and the extent to which thought has been given to the types of thing people do.  For example &mdash; I do not know whether the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Minister has done this &mdash; many people give gifts at election time to attract the attention of the electorate.  Gifts of pencils and pens are becoming increasingly common; in fact, if one is very lucky and happens to bump into a sufficient number of candidates, one can get enough to last until the next election, which saves one having to spend between elections.  During the last election campaign candidates were handing out brown paper bags with their parties&rsquo; logos on them to assist shoppers.  How many of those are appropriate for a local election candidate to purchase?  To what extent is this factored in to the Bill?  There are many gimmicky things candidates like to do, some of which one should probably not refer to in this House as they are somewhat towards the exotic end of things, although such spending tends to be incurred during Seanad elections rather then local government elections.</P>
        <P>I am curious as to how we got to this point and whether the Minister recognises that this is not in fact a level playing field.  As people from different backgrounds and with different levels of training and support take part in election campaigns, the playing field can never be level.  What the provisions actually do is to try to ensure those whose parties are in Government, who have media training or are involved in the media, or who have a pal who is a PR consultant get their messages across much more effectively than other candidates while spending the same as them.  The other candidates are denied the possibility of purchasing such expertise when they are not lucky enough to have the right friends in the right places.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that we cannot legislate for those who are media savvy.  I understand a very media savvy person may be running for Fine Gael in the <Col N="31"/>forthcoming by-election in Dublin South.  Perhaps he could confirm whether this rumour, which has been circulating around the House for quite some time, is true.</P>
        <P>I will provide the background to the legislation, which has been in gestation for quite some time.  We took soundings from people across the board.  The consultative committee on local government reform, which included members of all the main local government representative bodies and which was involved in the drafting of the Green Paper on Local Government Reform, considered the issue of expenditure limits and we had good feedback in this regard.  The consultative committee suggested the limit be set at approximately 50% of the general election spending limits.  The limit for a three-seat D&aacute;il constituency is &euro;30,150, so half of this is &euro;15,075.  I hope the Deputy sees the logic behind this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not see any logic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>A research report on local election spending limits was published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in which the Deputy&rsquo;s party was represented and its members made their points of view known.  This is what is causing me surprise.  They were in broad agreement with what I was doing and they said that consistently.  The Deputy will see this if he goes back over the minutes of the meetings.  It was noted by the committee members that the most common approach adopted internationally was the use of a formula based on the size of the electorate.  That is why we went along with that.  Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, who is on that committee, will agree with me that it was a cross-party approach.  Everybody involved, including the members of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party &mdash; I do not know whether Sinn F&eacute;in is represented on that committee &mdash; said this was the best approach and there was consensus on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister knows, we are on Committee Stage, and as this is our national Parliament we must raise important questions, whatever the consensus.  I have personal concerns about the extent to which this has been worked out, its implications and the science behind it.  What the Minister has told me is that no one has actually worked out what a candidate might spend money on to get a message across to, communicate with or come to the attention of the general public or the electorate.  The science behind the decision was this: some time ago someone fixed, probably equally unscientifically, what the spending limit should be in D&aacute;il elections, so half of that amount for local elections must be right.  That is not a science.</P>
        <P>Somewhere deep in the recesses of my mind is a recollection &mdash; I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that the Minister has already announced he will reduce the spending limits for general elections.  I am sure the Government would, if it could, introduce legislation to allow zero spending by any candidate from any party in a general election.  This proposal might even get two cheers from the general public and three cheers from the media.  It would enact this if it could, because then constant Government press conferences would be all that was required for its candidates to be elected.  This would be close to the politics we have seen over the years in a variety of unfortunate dictatorships across the world.</P>
        <P>The Minister is telling us that an unscientific figure was agreed on for the general elections which was essentially divided by two to work out an appropriate figure for the local elections, but that the figure will probably be reduced again for the next general election.  I suggest to the Minister, on the basis that we cannot stop spending entirely, to ensure that Fianna F&aacute;il, which the Green Party is propping up in Government &mdash; the most incompetent Government in the history of the State, with which we are cursed at this moment &mdash; remains permanently <Col N="32"/>in government by imposing a maximum spending limit of &euro;500 for any candidate in the two year lead-in to the next general election.  That would be appealing.  The Minister might give it consideration, and I am sure someone could work out a scientific formula to support it.  What is happening here is no more scientific than that.</P>
        <P>I accept Deputy Tuffy&rsquo;s point that there is a serious problem in that a person who is personally extremely rich could try to buy an election through considerable personal funding that does not derive from donations from members of the public who support him or her.  There is a history of rich people spending large sums of money on themselves when trying to get elected &mdash; not just in this country but elsewhere &mdash; and falling flat on their faces.  I am concerned there is a misconception on the part of politicians in all parties in the House that this type of legislation provides for a level playing field.  It does not.  What it does is to give an inordinate advantage to whoever happens to be in Government &mdash; and the way we are going, even if the entire island of Ireland was taken over by the IMF and the financial group of the European Commission, the Green Party would still be attached by an umbilical cord to Fianna F&aacute;il and keep it in Government &mdash; by ensuring a monopoly in the communication of political information vested in Government Ministers and Departments.  The Minister studiously avoided talking about all the advisers attached to his and other Departments or spending on consultants and press conferences.</P>
        <P>I could not seriously deal with the zombie issue earlier, because I find the whole thing so ludicrous.  However, this is a serious point.  In the lead-in to the local elections, how many press conferences will we see in individual constituencies with candidates anatomically attached to Ministers &mdash; appearing out of their left and right earlobes, attached to their legs, hands and everywhere &mdash; in the vague hope they will be in a picture or will get themselves on the 6 o&rsquo;clock or 9 o&rsquo;clock news on RTE or the 5.30 p.m. news on TV3?  All these things are about candidates trying to raise their profiles in their own constituencies.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister is well aware that parties in Government have an inordinate advantage in promoting their candidates, although perhaps not when a Government is as utterly incompetent as the present one.  It may be that the zombie formula attempted in the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis will not be utilised by the party&rsquo;s local election candidates given what I hear about their attempts to portray themselves as pseudo independents when they knock on voters&rsquo; doors.  They know nothing about what the Government is doing, do not support many of its policies and are opposed to everything that has a detrimental impact on people.  They are even opposed to measures that have not yet been announced and will disagree with the budget regardless of what it contains.  A number of Fianna F&aacute;il candidates are running such disassociated zombie election campaigns.  I am not sure that Green Party candidates are much better, although they have managed to uphold the perception that they are opposed to the Government at the same time as being a part of it.</P>

My colleagues in the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government agreed that election spending should be measured and limited.  Various suggestions were made regarding methodologies for apportioning spending because it is recognised that the population bases of local election areas can differ in terms of population size.  Rather than a debate on methodologies, however, I have heard a principled argument against the concept of spending limits.</P>
        <P>It is not political correctness to impose such limits because the argument for doing so is supported by research.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has provided Members with a report on this issue which states: &ldquo;Most commentators are broadly positive of the notion of spending limits during elections&rdquo;.  It quotes the following from a 2003 report from the Standards in Public Office Commission:  &ldquo;It is recognised internationally that having election spending limits in place is an important factor in fighting corruption and safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process&rdquo;.  Benoit and March state, &ldquo;spending is positively and significantly related to electoral success&rdquo;.  This is not anecdotal comment; it is reputable research which demonstrates the relationship between spending and outcome.  Our job is to put a framework on these findings.</P>
        <P>Walecki states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Money provides access to the basic tools of a modern democracy &mdash; for example, advertising, running political parties, selecting candidates, mobilizing voters and polling &mdash; and for this reason, political finance affects almost every aspect of democratic politics in both developing and consolidated democracies.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">It is, therefore, nonsensical to claim in this House that spending levels are not related to successful election outcomes.  What is the motive behind this change of position?  Is it because funding tends to shift alongside changes in the polls?  The Minister paraphrased St. Augustine in wanting to introduce spending limits but not yet.  When a poll pulls one in a different direction, like St. Paul one falls off the horse and is converted.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the Bill for the most part, I am disappointed that amendments Deputy Tuffy and I tabled were not accepted.  Sadly, our amendment providing voting rights for the homeless has been ruled to fall outside the scope of the Bill.  I urge the Minister to address this issue, whether through the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 or some other means.  The disenfranchisement of homeless people is a relic of the era when only property owners had the right to vote.  We have long since progressed towards a democratic republic in which every citizen is cherished and valued equally.  The right to own property should not be exclusively equated to the right to vote.  All people have the right to democratic participation and to register their franchise regardless of whether they rent or own property, or even if they live in sheltered accommodation.  If we based registration on PPSNs, this deficit in our democratic structures could be overcome.</P>
        <P>I cannot stress strongly enough that the issue of voting rights for the homeless is relevant to this House, even if it has been ruled outside of the scope of this Bill.  It is incumbent on us to address it.  We are here because people have exercised their right to chose their representatives in this House.  It is not acceptable that a significant part of our society is denied that right <Col N="34"/>because of a property and address related issue.  I urge the Minister to find some mechanism to address this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not intended to contribute to this debate and will not speak about the principles of the Bill but I wish to raise one issue.  I recall negotiating these issues with both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fianna Gael many years ago in the context of  D&aacute;il, European and presidential elections.  Provision was made at the time by the rainbow Government for spending limits in local elections as well.</P>
        <P>The subsequent Minister for the Environment and Local Government, however, had a different view and successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have watered down those provisions.  I hope, however, that we are now turning the corner and putting in place a realistic basis for equality when contesting elections, where the amount of money a candidate can spend will not be a determining factor.</P>
        <P>There will always be anomalies, it is not possible to craft a perfect Bill.  Section 4 is the heart of the Bill and it is hard to determine the basis for a figure.  I am concerned that it would be a percentage of a D&aacute;il spend.  How would that be relevant?  The Minister might reflect on these specific figures before the Bill goes before the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The Minister has allocated figures for the spend at the lowest of level, borough councils, of &euro;7,500.  Borough councils operate differently; Wexford Borough Council is a single electoral area with a population of 20,000 whereas most borough councils would have wards of perhaps 4,000.  The notion that we apply the same spend to reach 20,000 people as 4,000 is invidious.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to re-examine this because the crafting of the section displays an understanding that all borough councils operate on a ward system but there are others that operate on an integrated basis where there are 12 seats to be filled from the entire borough and, thanks to the Minister&rsquo;s own extension of this particular borough last year, it is now a significant area with in excess of 20,000 residents.  An election spend of &euro;7,500 in that context would not be fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Going back to Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s point, it is not accurate to say that someone categorised as homeless has no right to vote.  A homeless person faces particular difficulties in engaging with the electoral process, including his name being entered on the register of electors.  Current law provides that persons shall be registered where they are ordinarily resident.  The question arises of the best way to link a homeless person with an address and that matter is best left between the local registration authority and the person concerned.  The possibilities that arise include registering people at hostels or shelters permanently or temporarily.  Local authorities have a flexible approach to voter registration for homeless people.  It is not necessarily the case that proof of address will be demanded in every case.  I look to local authorities to be reasonable and adopt a common sense approach in such cases given the circumstances.</P>
        <P>If there is a need for documentation there are options.  It is sufficient for a homeless person living in a hostel to produce a letter from the hostel verifying his residence to collect unemployment assistance.  I see no reason local authorities could not follow suit.  A homeless person with no fixed abode is entitled to the weekly supplementary welfare allowance which is paid at the post office in the area in which he is based.  The person has a card that enables him to withdraw money.  This could be sufficient for registration.  Sometimes a homeless person is booked into an emergency hostel or bed and breakfast where rent allowance is payable and this is another way of assigning a place.  While we are not directly discussing this in the amendment, I wanted to clarify that.</P><Col N="35"/>
        <P>Deputy Howlin is right in what he said about borough councils, there is a variation between them.  Wexford is in this situation, as is Drogheda.  We did not have the numbers, however, from the census for borough councils and that is why we opted for &euro;7,500.  Many candidates contest both borough council elections and county council elections and we have made allowances for that, with an extra spend being permitted for those who do.  They will not be disadvantaged in that regard because there is still a level playing field.  There is a slight anomaly but it is down to the population figures currently available to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P>Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 7, before section 9, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;9.&mdash;The Schedule to the Act of 1999 is amended in paragraph 1(a) by the insertion after &ldquo;disseminating such advertising&rdquo; of &ldquo;and in this paragraph, &lsquo;advertising&rsquo; in the case of advertising in any newspaper or other periodical publication means advertising in a publication which was first published during the period specified by order under section 12B(1).  Regulations under this paragraph may provide for how the publication date of a periodical is to be determined.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In recent years, there have been developments in advertising media during elections.  Significant amounts are spent on newspaper advertisements, particularly in free sheets and weekly provincial newspapers.  This amendment seeks to establish a clear line for costings for such advertisements.</P>
        <P>A weekly newspaper or free sheet may be issued on a Tuesday afternoon but the publication date will be the following Friday.  Given that elections take place on Thursday, a week&rsquo;s advertising in that paper is outside the scope of the period of the election.  Because of the 60 day period, the publication date can fall in the first week of the period of the election and then fall out at the end depending on when the journal is released.</P>
        <P>This must be clarified because it is not uncommon.  The last week of an election campaign is the busiest time for newspaper advertising and most spending happens then.  The expenditure is accommodated within the legislation and it is a fact that we will be spending money during local election periods.  However, we need to determine whether expenditure taking place in the last week in this medium is accounted for and costed.</P>
      </Speaker>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully understand the intent of the amendment which I have discussed with my officials.  We have looked at examples, including the <i>Kilkenny People</i>.  The Deputy mentioned Tuesday afternoon, but the newspaper comes out on Wednesday, and Friday is the date referred to on the masthead.  Those are difficult matters.  I understand what the Deputy is trying to get at in the same way as I understood what he was trying to get at concerning the Internet.  We will seek guidelines for candidates on those issues.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is seeking to provide a more prescriptive interpretation of expenses on advertising for electoral purposes.  The Bill also includes provision for the Minister to bring forward further regulations in this area.  Having looked at it, I do not believe the Schedule, dating from the 1999 Act, needs to be amended in this way, but I will consider the matter further.  At the <Col N="36"/>moment I cannot accept the amendment.  The Deputy has suggested examining this matter further in the Seanad at a later date.</P>
        <P>I wished to clarify the situation on what are considered as election expenses for the purpose of making a spending declaration at a local election.  I will not go through that matter again, however, because we dealt with it on the previous amendment.  One of the effects of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment would be to create a significant difference in the definition of election expenses for local elections compared to those for D&aacute;il and other national elections.  We need to get that consistency.  The provisions of the 1999 Act, as amended by this Bill, are sufficient to provide for the declaration of spending on advertising for electoral purposes during the election.  They do not need to be elaborated upon further in the manner set out in the amendment.  We will, however, provide guidance for individuals which, in many ways, is common sense.  We can examine this to see if the date on a newspaper&rsquo;s masthead is the relevant one or not.</P>
        <P>There is also the question of defining the difference between daily newspapers, which are used for one day, and weekly newspapers or magazines which may be in circulation longer.  These questions are relevant.  If a weekly publication is part of the 60-day period, obviously it will have to be taken into account and will be part of the expenditure.  This is not and, given the nature of what we are discussing, can never be an exact science.  Deputy Howlin referred to having discussed the matter as a Minister in previous Administrations.  We are trying to do our best to ensure that certain limits apply.  We will provide the guidelines and will examine the issue in more detail.  At the moment, however, I am satisfied that what we have put in place is in line with our requirements.</P>

	<P>Is the Deputy considering withdrawing the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I am sure he will acknowledge that any of the amendments moved today were not prescriptive in tone, with the possible exception of the one on which we called a vote.  The amendment does not seek to assist the Minister, but rather candidates in the field.  We have all been candidates at one stage or another, and surely will be again when the next general election comes.  The amendment stems from my own experience as a candidate who had to complete reports and the standards in public office forms at the end of an election period.  I know from my own colleagues and those in other parties that assimilating all the paperwork can be a headache even though they try to make the best fist of it.</P>
        <P>I take on board the Minister&rsquo;s response that this matter will be examined further.  I will withdraw the amendment and look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s guidelines and direction on this matter in future.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 7, line 45, to delete &ldquo;7&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;10&rdquo;.</P><Col N="37"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">These are straightforward amendments which aim to give candidates and their postering teams more time to remove posters after elections.  If candidates are involved in a long campaign it may take three or four days for them and their teams to recover.  The amendment takes cognisance of that fact.  In addition, the amendment allows for the fact that not all candidates have armies of helpers who are in a position to remove all the posters in a timely manner.  The geography of constituencies can vary, so it can take time to get around to postering duties.  Therefore these amendments seek to increase the time period for the removal of posters after an election campaign, from seven to ten days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his amendment and he is right to say that campaigns can be exhausting.  In particular, if a candidate has lost an election, his or her enthusiasm for taking down posters can be somewhat diminished. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerenceFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Terence Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the seven day period has worked well.  The best way for any candidate to approach this matter is to ensure that, if he or she has a team that is paid to put up posters, the contract includes their removal also.  That is happening increasingly and it seems to work fairly well.  I have been impressed by the way in which all political parties have approached this matter.  For the most part, they have complied with the seven day rule.  Deputies will be aware, however, that some mischievous individuals sometimes take down a candidate&rsquo;s poster and, for the fun of it, put it up again after the seven day period has elapsed.  That is happening and if the individuals involved can be caught that is fair enough; otherwise there is very little one can do about it.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, Deputy Higgins took exception to the view &mdash; which I do not hold &mdash; that somehow election posters constitute litter.  They do not, of course.  They are a means of advertising a candidate, but they do become a litter problem after a certain period.  One of the major issues I am trying to address concerns plastic ties that hold posters in place.  Very often the posters are removed after an election, but the plastic ties are left there.  The problem with making their removal voluntary is that people do not feel obliged to do it.  I would have hoped for good co-operation between local authorities and candidates.  I wanted to ensure that we either had recyclable tags or biodegradable ones, so we are examining this matter.  Alternatively, we could have identifiable tags so we could know to which party they belonged.  That is the way to approach this matter.  It is not my intention to curtail freedom of expression in any way.  Posters add an air of excitement to a campaign and let people know that an election is taking place.</P>
        <P>In the past few elections there has been a problem with the proliferation of posters.  Some postering is excessive.  One poster per pole is fine but I have seen candidates on the evening an election is declared putting up three posters on one pole just to prevent other candidates using the spot.  There is a need for some form of regulation.  We are satisfied the seven-day limit in place is adequate and ensures poster-free lamp posts all over the city quickly after an election.</P>

    <Title>Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>We are having this debate in changed circumstances to those that were in place when the framework for this legislation was drawn up under the social partnership agreement Towards 2016 in 2006.  In that time the employment situation has changed considerably.  The Government and the social partners could not have predicted such a haemorrhaging of jobs as has been seen recently.  There was a record increase in the number of people on the live register in January and February, with twice the number joining the dole as did in November 2008.  Over 340,000 people are now unemployed with the Taoiseach admitting unemployment could reach 400,000 by the end of the year.  If the rise continues at the current rate, the final figure will be much higher.  There is general agreement that unemployment could reach 11% by December.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, was established to support employees&rsquo; rights at a time when the citizens of new accession EU member states could seek employment in Ireland.  The economy needed them to fill vacant positions.  Since then, we have had a harsh dose of reality.  The Bill must now be considered in the context of rising unemployment and ensuring employers are kept in business and can continue to offer employment.</P>
        <P>Employees need protection and support from the State from unscrupulous employers.  We all know of the high profile cases such as the Gama workers.  There are other reports of abuse across all employment sectors.  I am not singling out or giving absolution to any one but there is a need to protect employees.  There is also, however, a need for balance and a fair approach.  In 2006, NERA carried out over 2,000 inspections for minimum wage compliance with breaches in only 104 cases.  In 2007, there was a similar detection rate with one prosecution.  The minimum wage legislation is only one measure to protect workers with a raft of other measures in place such as health and safety, work time, maternity leave, etc.</P>
        <P>Mr. Pat Crotty, chairman of the Small Firms Association, recently informed the enterprise committee that a small firm employer will need knowledge of 40 items of employment law to ensure compliance with employment regulations.  We must keep in mind the current pressures on businesses.  This Bill should not view employers and businesses as being out to exploit workers.  Many hard-working employers are committed to growing their businesses and offering employment.  This Bill will only add to the increasing bureaucratic burden on employers.</P>
        <P>The House has debated the difficulties faced by small businesses in the current economic environment.  We must recognise that they need to be protected and supported rather than having onerous legislation imposed on them.  According to representatives from small businesses, the Bill, as drafted, will stifle the employment creation potential of many small firms.  As they informed the enterprise committee, would they risk being the subject of 23 new criminal offences as contained in the Bill to employ someone in order to grow their business?  The safer bet, they claim, is to stay as is by not increasing employment, but actually reducing it where possible.</P>
        <P>The legislation will change the existing relationship between employers and employees.  It will potentially criminalise employers, giving NERA the power to impose on-the-spot fines without giving an employer a chance to rectify a problem.  Provision for fines of up to &euro;250,000 and prison sentences for non-compliance is also made.</P>
        <P>Employers will be obliged to register employees and obtain passport identification in respect of them in certain circumstances.  They will be also obliged to provide employees with state<Col N="39"/>ments of service when they leave their positions.  That is fine for companies with 100 or more employees which would have the human resources personnel in place to deal with such tasks.  However, the provisions of the legislation will also apply to businesses that employ only one person.  The Government must recognise that small businesses are being overburdened.  Like previous speakers, I wish to ask the Minister of State whether a regulatory impact statement, RIA, might be completed in respect of the legislation to identify the effect it will have on employers and the costs to which it will give rise.</P>
        <P>Small businesses are the backbone of the economy and we are becoming increasingly reliant on them.  Such businesses must be protected.  We must acknowledge the risks taken by those who establish a business and employ, for example, two to six people.  These individuals are obliged to pay rent and high local authority charges.  Representatives of the Vintners Federation of Ireland came before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment yesterday and indicated that water charges have increased threefold in the past two years.  That is a major burden on any small business.</P>
        <P>It is becoming increasingly difficult for businesses to operate in this country.  The banks are not facilitating them because they are not releasing funds.  When the recapitalisation scheme was implemented, the Minister imposed a condition in this regard.  However, representations have been made to Members on all sides with regard to how difficult it has become for businesses to access funds.  These businesses are viable, are a strong presence in their communities and have a future.  It does not make sense, therefore, that they are not being supported during this difficult period.  There is no doubt they will get their affairs in order.  However, the banks are not making funding available to them.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated recently that the question of the minimum wage must be addressed.  I do not believe we can afford to reduce the minimum wage but I am of the view that it should be frozen for a number of years.  As the Minister of State is aware, the minimum wage is set at &euro;8.65 and everything is relative to it.  I accept that employing people has become expensive but I do not believe those at the lower end of the income scale should be targeted.  Ours is a high-cost economy and it is becoming difficult to do business here.  In that context, I would support a freeze being imposed in respect of the minimum wage.</P>
        <P>The Bill will impose an additional burden on employers which they cannot afford during this difficult period.  Is it really necessary to establish the National Employment Rights Agency, NERA, as an autonomous body?  Would it not be possible to have NERA inspectors operate under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?  There are now so many inspectors in NERA that it recently turned its attention to the restaurant and hospitality sector outside Dublin.  Many establishments which serve food on Sundays have been obliged to stop doing so because the employment regulation order that is in place &mdash; to which a blind eye was previously turned &mdash; is being enforced.  Increasing numbers of these establishments cannot trade on Sundays because it is impossible for them to pay their employees double time.  The latter is unnecessary in this day and age.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.3- ?>
        <P>I have spoken to many people who were let go because their employers could not afford to pay double time.  The individuals in question are students or young mothers &mdash; who would be covered from a child care perspective &mdash; who want to earn money by working on Sundays.  The situation is ludicrous.  Some progress has been made in respect of premium rates for Sunday work but we will be obliged to see how matters develop.  It does not make sense that, in respect of this matter, there is one rule for Dublin and another for Cork and other places.  In an era when people expect to be able to shop on a 24-hour basis, one would certainly expect to be able to order soup and a sandwich in one&rsquo;s local pub on a Sunday.  Pubs should not be obliged <Col N="40"/>to shut down their kitchen operations on Sundays as a result of a restrictive regulation that makes no sense.  It is bureaucracy gone mad.</P>
        <P>The Bill is over-burdensome and unnecessary and should be reconsidered in light of the changing economic situation.  It will be responsible for jobs being lost rather than being protected.  I will be particularly interested in discussing on Committee Stage section 45, which relates to electrical contractors and which is particularly over-burdensome.  Many members have been contacted by such contractors in respect of this section.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage and to highlighting the difficulties being experienced by employers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Employment Law Compliance Bill.  For some time, I have expressed, both publicly and at meetings of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, major reservations with regard to aspects of this Bill.  However, I take this opportunity to commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, on his efforts on our behalf, particularly in the context of the recent statement with regard to paying employees double time on Sundays.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State has been extremely attentive in respect of this matter and is doing his best on our behalf.  He has been, however, somewhat hindered by some of the mechanisms that were put in place in recent years.  I hope action will be taken in respect of those mechanisms in the coming months.</P>
        <P>The most significant element of the Employment Law Compliance Bill is that it will place the National Employment Rights Agency, NERA, and its powers and responsibilities, on a statutory footing.  NERA was established on an interim basis in 2007 and from what I have seen of its operations since then and from what I have heard from employers and employees about the methods it has employed to date, I would be extremely concerned with regard to it being placed on a statutory footing.  The approach NERA has taken towards many local businesses in my constituency has been, to put it mildly, heavy handed.  Alarm bells started ringing approximately one year ago about NERA&rsquo;s activities when groups, not just employers but also employees, contacted my constituency office, either by telephone or in writing, and outlined the difficulties they were experiencing.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt Members do not want to see workers being taken advantage of.  The shameful treatment of workers in Irish Ferries in my constituency a number of years ago showed that a small number of employers will put their profits before the rights and entitlements of employees.  It is, therefore, correct that we should put in place procedures to combat the abuse of workers.  However, in light of NERA&rsquo;s actions in recent years, I cannot but think that our response to companies such as Irish Ferries has been similar to the approach of using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.  In trying to stop these blatant abuses of workers&rsquo; rights, we are primarily targeting small companies that are struggling to survive in the current economic climate.  NERA is putting these companies under pressure to such an extent that jobs are being lost in County Wexford and elsewhere throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il for 20 months.  I come from a self-employed background and one of the most frustrating things for me is the lack of speed with which we deal with issues relating to government and Government policy.  Business and what I refer to as the real world move at a rapid pace, but Departments and the House operate at a different speed level when dealing with issues of huge concern to the private sector.</P>
        <P>Small businesses have huge difficulties at present.  Most people who are self-employed consider their businesses and the work they are trying to do completely over-regulated.  There is probably a huge lack of knowledge of employment law in the private sector.  Most people who open small businesses concentrate on getting the rent down, the shop fitted out and the stock <Col N="41"/>in place before taking on two or three people to work for them.  A month or two later when things settle down they discover there is a raft of employment law of which they were not aware and with which they will have to deal as they try to run their businesses.  The NERA has a role to play in that area in terms of its information campaign.  A number of efforts have been made by the NERA over the last number of years to try to promote the importance of its work and role, but it has a huge role to play in ensuring that the information gets to all small businesses.</P>
        <P>I understand 19 joint labour committees have been set up.  They are the result of employment regulation orders with which, again, I have no difficulty.  They have existed for a long time.  However, the priority of the joint labour committees is to protect workers&rsquo; rights.  I believe they have failed in this, particularly with regard to the catering sector.  They have failed to protect the most important item, which is jobs in the sector.  Thousands of jobs have been lost because of a decision by joint labour committees, who purport to represent all the organisations representing hotels, restaurants and other sectors.  I have found that most small businesses are not members of these organisations and they do not feel that the organisations broadly represent them.  They are faced with a situation where a labour charge for Sunday work has been imposed on them.</P>
        <P>I recall from when I was self-employed that while the rates collectors were nice people and I knew them very well, one was never happy to see them arrive with the bill because it was seen as another tax.  This was particularly so if they arrived on a day when one had received a difficult bank statement or a machine had broken or one was faced with other costs.  To have a NERA inspector arrive on one&rsquo;s doorstep is also very worrying for the employer, particularly if he feels he has been doing the right thing by paying his workers a fair rate and not over-working them.  Despite that, he is now facing very stiff penalties, in view of some of the rules and regulations coming on stream.</P>
        <P>The representative bodies of the JLCs must be much more flexible in their approach and more proactive in dealing with the issue.  For over a year I have been raising the double time on Sunday issue, where we had the ridiculous situation of Dublin charging one and a third while it was double time in all the rural areas.  This has cost us a huge amount of jobs throughout the country.</P>
        <P>We brought this to the attention of the Minister of State and I am aware he has been in touch with the joint labour committees.  However, I first raised the matter last July.  Why has the joint labour committee not met, if it is the representative body of all these groups who are lobbying Deputies on all sides of the House?  Why has it not been able to deal with this issue?  It is clear to everybody that this is causing huge concern and is costing jobs.  I call on the joint labour committee to meet immediately about this sector and to deal with the issue as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>
        <P>I have a number of letters &mdash; I will not give the names of the individuals concerned &mdash; that give a flavour of what we are facing in terms of the reaction of small businesses to NERA and this Bill.  The first letter is from a landlord whose tenant is an Indian restaurant.  He states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">As I am sure you are aware, the Employment Compliance Bill (Or Anti Employment Bill) shall be coming before the Dail for enactment within the coming months.  I hereby plead with you not to support this Bill in order to save thousands of jobs and business&rsquo;s throughout Ireland.  The hospitality and catering sector can simply not afford to have anymore anti business legislation enforced upon it.  I should add that I have no problem with employment laws in general and that I would never tolerate any abuse of an employee in any shape or manner.  However, the pendulum has swung severely to the left in this country now and the <Col N="42"/>results of this can be seen at the many lengthening dole queues throughout the nation as I write.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I also received a letter from the representative of one of the major hotels in the county.  He says:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The hotel industry is a seven day week operation more so than any other industry in the country.  Any employee joining the industry is fully aware of the business and what it entails and accepts that weekend and Sunday work is the norm.  I would note that Sunday opening for retail outlets has only been widespread over the last 10 years due to consumer demand but yet they are only obliged to pay a third premium.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The payment of double time for Sunday means that for the most basic job within the hotel we are required to pay &euro;20.13 per hour.  This is before the imposition of holiday pay and Employer PRSI which brings the ultimate hotel cost to in excess of &euro;24.  This is uneconomical and while the hotel industry is a seven day week operation, the rest of the week is in effect subsidising the Sunday.  This has already seen hotels curtailing their services and hence the number of staff they require on a Sunday  While we have not yet taken this course of action, it is certainly one that we are considering.</P>
         <P LI="1" el="0">Within the JLC, there is no clause to claim inability to pay, and as a result we are legally obliged to pay all entitlements under the JLC even though it could lead to the closure of our business.  [This business employes over 400 staff].</P>
         <P LI="1" el="0">2008 has been a very difficult year for our hotel group, with sales decreasing on average 15-20% since June on the comparable months from last year.  As a result we are now running a wage percentage of 41% to 30th September 2008, which when you consider that we have 2 of the quietest months of the year (October and November) still to feed into this figure, it will ultimately mean a likely wage percentage of in excess of 42% for the year.  This is certainly not sustainable.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">One can see the difficulties people are encountering in the industry.  For that reason I am hugely concerned about what we are about to do with the NERA.  The NERA has been particularly vigorous over the last year in targeting small businesses.  The previous speaker alluded to the fact that it has targeted the hotel and catering sectors.  Wexford is no different.  I have met a large number of employers and employees who have told me about the problems that these NERA inspections are causing them.  Hotels, pubs and restaurants are curtailing their services on Sundays.  Many of them no longer serve food on Sundays and jobs are being lost as a result.  How is our local tourism industry going to survive if visitors to Wexford and other counties have difficulty getting a meal on a Sunday?  It is crazy.</P>
        <P>Many of the businesses being affected by these inspections are struggling to survive at present.  They are facing the uncertainty of whether they can pay their bills and wages each week.  Instead of recognising the difficulties they are facing and offering them some sort of assistance, we are inflicting NERA inspections on them.  A number of employees of one business came to my office after a NERA inspection and presented me with a petition asking the Government to stop NERA from ensuring that they are paid the Sunday premium.  They did not want the money, even though NERA insisted that they take it, because they saw Sunday as part of their normal working week.  They were afraid the business they worked for would have to close on Sundays because it would not be able to afford the extra wage costs.</P>
        <P>This particular business was also caught for lump sum payments, which is very difficult for a small business to take on board.  I have heard that some lump sums are a minimum of &euro;15,000 and sometimes more.  In fairness to the employers, I believe they genuinely did not know that <Col N="43"/>they were supposed to pay the particular rate at the time.  This relates to my earlier point about ensuring the information gets out to the businesses concerned.  Government agencies should not make people fear for the security of their jobs.  People are already fearful in the current climate.  Unfortunately, that is exactly the result of NERA&rsquo;s operation.</P>
        <P>Another reservation I have about the Bill is the level of powers being given to NERA and the free hand it is being given in carrying out inspections.  Under the Bill, NERA is given the legal right to carry out unannounced inspections on any business premises in the country, even when there is no suspicion of any wrongdoing.  The civilian equivalent of this would be to give the Garda the power to enter and search a private home without any cause.  In my view, all inspections should be by prior appointment only.  If one is due for a tax audit, the Revenue will write to inform one of the date.  NERA should not be any different in that regard.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We have also been told that one of the instructions given for NERA inspections is that they be carried out at a reasonable hour.  I know of a case in my constituency where NERA inspectors entered a restaurant at 8 p.m. on a Saturday night &mdash; the busiest time in the restaurant&rsquo;s week, and the only time it was anywhere close to making a profit &mdash; and insisted that the restaurant owner sit down with them and go through all the employment records.  The owner had to debate whether to shut down the restaurant to deal with the inspectors.  Is 8 p.m. on a Saturday night NERA&rsquo;s interpretation of a reasonable hour?  That is absolutely ridiculous and should not be tolerated by business owners or this House.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.3- ?>
        <P>I am very concerned about the lack of accountability for this State agency that we are about to put on a statutory footing.  I have raised many issues in that regard in recent months but I was told that nothing could be done because NERA is an independent body.  There is no mechanism in place where Members of this House, or people affected by the inspections, can raise legitimate concerns about the activities of NERA and have them addressed.  I understand an advisory board is being established and the director of NERA is required to have regard to the advice of the board.  However, he merely &ldquo;has to have regard&rdquo; to the advice.  Does having regard to advice mean that the issues raised will be acted upon?  I am worried by NERA&rsquo;s lack of accountability and I urge the Minister to consider the matter.</P>
        <P>One of the sanctions specified in the Bill is that a business owner who has been found guilty of malpractice will bear the cost of the investigation, but there is no reference to NERA bearing any costs for the loss of business to a company that was investigated and found not to be involved in any malpractice.  A measure of that nature would be an interesting option to consider and could make NERA inspectors more accountable for their actions.  It would make them more understanding of the huge pressures businesses face in today&rsquo;s market and I hope it would bring an end to the practice of inspecting busy restaurants not only on Saturday night, but on any night.  There is plenty of time during the day to carry out their work.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about the criminal charges that are envisaged as sanctions under the Bill.  We will make it a criminal offence for an employer not to display a notice telling employees how to contact NERA.  Surely that is going a step too far?  Most businesses now have a wall full of certificates, notifications and paperwork on them already.  Perhaps the matter could be addressed by the dissemination of information by NERA.  There are no less than 23 new criminal offences under the Bill.  We have already seen the difficulties caused by criminal offences to fishermen, yet we are treating another area of small business in the same manner.  What self-employed person would be given any incentive to try to grow a business by hiring employees when it would be much safer to continue working at his or her current level?  Many of the criminal charges are a further obstacle to job creation and I am extremely concerned by them.  As the fines range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;250,000, I can foresee a scenario where the key will be handed to the NERA inspector or a court because businesses will not be able to cope.</P><Col N="44"/>
        <P>All speakers have alluded to the fact that we are in difficult economic circumstances at present.  The first concern for anyone with an interest in the economy, be it Government, State agencies, workers, employers, the joint labour committees and the social partners, must be to create conditions that will promote the retention of the maximum number of people in employment.  We must be aware of the current circumstances and the impact the terms and conditions of the Bill will have on the ability of businesses to provide employment.  Everyone has a duty in this regard.  However, I am concerned about the role of NERA as it currently operates and as it is proposed to operate under the Bill.  Perhaps a two-year sabbatical could be introduced to allow businesses to get back on their feet.  That time could be well spent on the education of employers and employees regarding their rights and of the role NERA will have in the future.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take on board the serious concerns that exist about this Bill and to consider the various measures proposed in it and whether they will help or hinder the process of maintaining employment in the small business sector.</P>
        <P>Flexibility is key in small businesses.  I have a very good friend in the grocery business.  He told me he employs a number of girls to work on his deli counter.  Under employment law they must have a break between 11.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m., which is the busiest time for the deli counter.  He cannot afford to give his staff a break during that period but under employment law he cannot afford not to allow them to take an hour&rsquo;s break.  He is in a difficult situation.  In the real world people have to show flexibility in terms of working time and working hours.  The reality is that those workers work during that four-hour period and take their break before or after it.  NERA must be watched very carefully and encouraged to be pro-jobs, especially with a view to job retention, in addition to its current role of protecting workers&rsquo; rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to discuss the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill and having such a comprehensive debate on it.</P>
        <P>Having listened to a considerable amount of debate on the Bill in recent weeks, I am somewhat disconcerted to find many speakers on the Government and the Fine Gael benches make a virtual concerted attack on the legislation with scarcely a mention of workers.  Approximately 98% of the time those speakers considered the Bill from the perspective of employers.  Obviously, it is extremely important to ensure that we maximise the amount of employment in this country, but we do not wish to do so at the expense of undermining workers rights.</P>
        <P>Much legislation has been put in place on the minimum wage, working time and other employment legislation.  We must take a principled position, and if we put in place legislation to provide for certain rights for workers, we must uphold it and put in place a mechanism to ensure it is upheld.  I understand that is the context in which the legislation is being introduced, so that the enforcement of the law is on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>I can outline some horrendous cases of human exploitation.  For example, SIPTU held a conference for hotel workers on 18 February.  In many ways catering is the area that is most vulnerable currently.  Some of the issues raised by hotel workers who attended the SIPTU open day in Dublin on hotel workers rights included long working hours, payment below the minimum wage and no rest breaks.</P>
        <P>Hotel staff are among the most exploited and lowest paid workers in the State.  NERA found that approximately 80% of hotels were breaking employment laws.  The branch organiser, Mr. Paul Henry, said that at least 60% to 70% of hotel workers were non-Irish and that this increased their vulnerability.  They are particularly vulnerable at present.  He said the union <Col N="45"/>had encountered a substantial increase in requests for help from workers in non-union hotels in recent weeks.  He also said: &ldquo;There has been a steady increase from early December and since Christmas it has been relentless.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>He outlined that housekeeping staff had to fight for vacuum cleaners, no porters were available for heavy lifting and the supervisor always screamed at staff that they were working too slowly.  Within a month of starting work, one lady&rsquo;s wages were cut twice but if anybody complained to the boss, he or she was told to find another job.  She was very afraid as she was in the country on a work permit.  SIPTU took up that case, among others, and outlined the details of how matters had improved as a result.</P>
        <P>Down the road in the Gresham Hotel many of the most senior staff have been put on short-term work and told there is no work even though we are coming into the busy holiday season from St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day on when tourist numbers increase.  People have been recruited in their place and they have been told they must leave for a month.  When that month is up, they will be told they must go for another month because of the lack of work, but other staff will be recruited at or below the minimum wage.  This is the human side of the coin.</P>
        <P>These people are trying to earn a living.  They provide a good service, but they are being discriminated against.  We must get the balance right in this area.  While flexibility is important in the catering area, we cannot, as legislators, allow the situation return to the old days of William Martin Murphy where workers have no rights.  We cannot return to the days of Dickens and the Mr. Gradgrind syndrome.  That era is over.  We must get the balance right and that is what this legislation attempts to do.</P>
        <P>We need this legislation because we have not got the balance right to date.  The 2007 and 2008 reports of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, are a litany of exploitation in this country.  The trade union movement has been pressing for ages, as has the Opposition, for inspectors in the workplace, but these have been as scarce as hens&rsquo; teeth.  People in the construction industry were dying because there were no inspectors and due to the lack of enforcement.</P>
        <P>In other areas of the industry there was huge exploitation with regard to the minimum wage and working hours.  This was happening under the watch of the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, who was the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment at the time.  She would not allow inspectors to come in.  Thankfully, in 2007, we got 50 inspectors and now in 2008 we have 80 inspectors, an adequate number to carry out the job.  Inspectors must have a structure under which they will operate and clear statutory guidelines to follow.  This is what we are talking about in this Bill.</P>
        <P>Towards 2016, which was negotiated by the Government with the social partners, requires the Government to introduce legislation to secure better compliance with best employment practices and standards and with existing legislation.  The NERA reports of 2007 and 2008 indicate how badly this legislation is needed.  The reports identified a range of blatant abuses in the workplace during those years, which are the only years for which we have information, because there was no enforcement structure in place up to that time.</P>
        <P>The appalling vista is that these wholesale abuses in the workplace were taking place the length and breadth of the country not only in 2008, but for the entire duration of the Celtic tiger.  People made vast fortunes in that time but there were no serious inspection procedures to uncover exploitation.  Unscrupulous employers have taken full advantage of the absence of adequate supervision and monitoring of the workplace.</P><Col N="46"/>
        <P>However, the Government has been the real culprit.  It stubbornly refused to appoint inspectors and failed to enforce compliance with employment legislation.  The National Employment Rights Authority was not appointed until 2007, and then only on an interim, non-statutory basis.  It was light regulation or none &mdash; we have seen the result of that in the area of the banks and financial institutions.  It was Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats ideology to let it rip in the marketplace.  They allowed their developer friends to run the show and established no obstacles to greed or profit.</P>
        <P>In those years of plenty, many people were exploited.  Irish workers were underpaid in many industries and many worked on dangerous building sites.  Injuries and deaths occurred in the mad rush to build properties, many of which cannot now be sold.  This could and should have been avoided.  I am not saying the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, was in charge at the time, but Ministers must accept some responsibility for the colossal number of accidents on building sites.</P>
        <P>Non-national workers were particularly prone to exploitation.  The stubborn refusal of the Government, in collaboration with the British Government, to allow the EU Temporary (Agency) Workers Directive 2002 to be enacted in member states facilitated unscrupulous employers in denying the rights of thousands of workers to proper pay and conditions of employment in Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current scandal in the banking system, where the pillars of the financial establishment bent every law in the book to aggrandise themselves and in so doing destroyed the economy, has ruined people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods.  The lack of regulation in the financial sector has destroyed the economy and caused unemployment to rise to 354,000.  This is the result of the greed of people in positions of authority in the private sector who were not subjected to any regulation.  The banking scandal stems from the same principle of greed and exploitation that ravaged the workplace over a decade.  Exploitation and greed did not just happen in the banking sector, but right across the board.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention some of the more serious breaches and problems encountered by NERA in 2008.  These include employers not keeping any records on employees or failing to produce records for inspection; falsifying records, including payslips and time sheets; requiring employees to work in excess of the legal limit; paying employees for significantly fewer hours than the hours actually worked; paying employees less than their legal entitlement; not providing employees with payslips; and making unlawful deductions from employees&rsquo; wages.</P>
        <P>In 2008, NERA&rsquo;s inspectors carried out a total of 27,900 calls, interviews and inspections.  This was an increase of 96% on 2007, the year NERA was set up pending establishment on a statutory basis.  NERA inspectors detected 4,629 breaches of employment law in 2008, compared to 2,344 in 2007.  Arrears due, totalling &euro;3,112,064, were recovered by NERA in 2008 and paid back to defrauded workers.  The amount recovered over the two years came to over &euro;5 million.  Clearly, the sharp increase from 50 inspectors in 2007 to 80 in 2008 had a significant effect on the number of inspections and detections.  NERA conducts its investigations in a fair and impartial fashion.  Therefore, it is not a question of a thief arriving in the night and causing mayhem.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Employment Law Compliance Bill is to put the National Employment Rights Authority on a statutory footing and give it enhanced powers and sanctions.  Already, NERA has proved its worth.  Statutory authority and increased powers of inspection and enforcement augur well for the protection of workers&rsquo; rights and for redressing them where they are denied.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P>NERA also provides essential information services through its website which in the past 12 months received 1.8 million hits.  This information service would not exist if the authority had not been set up.  Hits are coming not just from employees making complaints, but are coming in increasing numbers from employers, who often are not aware of their obligations.  It is important this information is available in a fair and balanced fashion.  NERA received 115,000 calls in 2008 seeking information or making complaints, a 37% increase on 2007 and received 11,300 e-mail inquiries, compared to 5,700 in 2007.</P>
        <P>The situation with regard to awareness of employment regulations is almost like the situation with regard to knowledge of the Lisbon treaty.  There is a significant lack of information on employment rights on both sides, employers and employees.  Now, at last, NERA has lanced that boil and brought into the open the fact that we have a significant sector where employers are not aware of their obligations and employees are unaware of their rights.  This is particularly true in vulnerable areas of employment such as the hotel and catering industry.  This will, hopefully, be addressed by both NERA and the advisory body.  There is scope for a more balanced and co-operative approach in these areas.</P>
        <P>I have heard calls for the legislation to be scrapped in its entirety.  It was not only said that NERA should be put on the back burner or abolished entirely, but also that it is a quango.  It would be a terrible shame to abolish it because NERA demonstrates that it is doing a great job and that there is considerable exploitation at present.  Exploitation must be addressed.  There is exploitation of legislation we have passed in this House and exploitation of human beings providing a service through work.</P>
        <P>One of the major concerns of the electorate at the time of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty in June 2008 pertained to workers&rsquo; rights.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, will know from the Millward Brown survey that 40% of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; did so because they had &ldquo;significant concerns&rdquo; over exploitation and the undermining of workers&rsquo; rights.  This comprised a significant issue and there was a significant campaign in this regard at the time.</P>
        <P>There was much concern abroad over the failure of the Government to appoint workplace inspectors.  This was quite a lively issue and was raised in the House continually.  There was concern over the failure of the Government to protect temporary agency workers and also to protect against the threat posed in EU member states to hard-won workers&rsquo; rights regarding the workers&rsquo; directive.  Members will all remember the Laval, R&uuml;ffert, Viking and Luxembourg cases.  All these had an impact and were all related to the protection of workers in the workplace.</P>

        <P>In December, the Taoiseach and the representatives of the EU member states put together a package of proposals to underpin a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty in the autumn.  In it they promised collectively to attach &ldquo;high importance&rdquo; to workers&rsquo; rights.  This was part of the guarantees issued at the summit meeting in December.</P>
        <P>This legislation is a significant measure towards ensuring domestic protection for Irish workers.  It is important that it be passed into law and that the additional powers, including in respect of penalties, be granted to NERA without delay.  A strong, well-funded and effective statutory authority will do much to reassure the trade union movement and the workforce that the Government has at last agreed to provide the necessary protection to prevent the exploitation of working men and women in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has made it clear that its support for a second referendum cannot be taken for granted by the Government.  Significant progress on the provision of protection for workers must be demonstrated by the Government.  This legislation is a major step in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="48"/>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to reply to the debate on this legislation.  There was much interest in the Second Stage speeches inside and outside the House.  They were followed closely not only by interested employer representative groups, but also by the trade union movement and Deputies who did not have an opportunity to contribute in the House.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt but that there are varying views &mdash; to put it mildly &mdash; on whether this Bill will be of benefit to employees and employers.  Having listened to the Second Stage debate, I learned of the concerns causing difficulties for some Deputies.  It is certain there will be strong and robust debate on Committee Stage.  While the basic tenets and principles of the Bill will stand, I am sure we will consider as favourably, sympathetically and flexibly as possible all amendments that might make the Bill more beneficial to employees or employers, or both.</P>
        <P>I accept the bona fides of Deputies who have commented on numerous occasions on rates of pay.  If this Bill became law by midnight, not one provision would change the lives of employers tomorrow morning.  NERA has all its investigative powers only because it is enforcing the employment rights legislation on the Statute Book.  It is important that this is said because there is an incorrect view that NERA is setting the rates.  It is only enforcing the employment conditions agreed in the context of discussions involving joint industrial councils and joint labour committees.  It is basically enforcing the de facto law of the land and does no more than that.  I have read the Bill, including its explanatory memorandum, from start to finish on a couple of occasions and cannot find any statutory provision giving responsibility for the setting of rates to NERA.  Rate of pay are set by joint industrial councils and they become registered employment agreements, which are enforced by labour inspectors and are to be enforced by NERA.</P>
        <P>I hope this will be reflected in the statutory provisions when the Bill is passed, but there will be no change in the context of daily policing of breaches of employment law raised with labour inspectors by trade union officials, employees or employers.  Cases have been raised by employers.  If one has a hotel in one end of a town and is paying the de facto statutory pay rates but one&rsquo;s competitor at the other end of the town is not, one is put at a very serious commercial disadvantage.  It is important to get the balance right.  There are certain areas where the joint labour committees and joint industrial councils must become more responsive to needs that arise and to the commercial reality of a given sector or the workplace in general.  This point was made by Deputy Connick.</P>
        <P>I ran into hot water with an individual some time ago over the minimum wage.  Deputy Clune raised this issue today.  At no stage did I say the minimum wage should be reduced or increased.  I was just making the point that the Labour Court adjudicates on the minimum wage and when it has made its final determination, it presents it to the Minister, who can either accept, reject or amend it.  He or she can have it adjudicated upon by external consultants or expert bodies, such as the ESRI or NESC, to determine what would happen if the minimum wage were raised, lowered or amended in any way.  That was the only point I was making.</P>
        <P>I stated in respect of joint labour committees and joint industrial councils that there is a new reality.  We know some companies and sectors are under enormous pressure, as highlighted frequently by Deputies on all sides, including today.  The catering sector, for example, falls into this category.  Deputy Connick is correct that it took a long time for the joint labour committee to acknowledge there was a discrepancy pertaining to rates of pay during Sunday trading in Dublin and elsewhere.  Eventually, it discussed the issue under an independent chairman and reached an interim agreement.  Such an agreement is subject to a statutory process and must <Col N="49"/>be lodged before the Labour Court.  Submissions are sought from interested parties and, ultimately, if the rate is agreed upon, it becomes the law of the land.  NERA will have no hand, act or part in making such decisions and will only be involved in their enforcement.</P>
        <P>I will probably read of cases of exploitation.  Deputy Costello pointed out that there are genuine cases of exploitation of workers.  There is not much point in deluding ourselves into believing every individual is the nicest person in town.  There are cases of genuine exploitation and we must put in place some mechanism so the authorities of the State can say there is an inspectorate with statutory powers that can enforce the laws of the land.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P>We have already taken on board some Members&rsquo; views on the criminalisation of employers and we will table amendments in this regard, which I hope will receive broad approval on all sides.  We wanted to have legislation which would be supportive of, and supported by, employers and employees and which would have broad support in the House.  This would send out a very strong message because not only do we want compliance through enforcement, we want to have compliance through education and encouragement.  We want the employers, trade unions and employees to buy into this in order that we have a stream of information on people&rsquo;s rights, entitlements and obligations, which would be very welcome.</P>
        <P>I spoke to NERA on numerous occasions.  It has been brought to my attention, and I accept, that some labour inspectors are what I term &ldquo;overenthusiastic&rdquo; and what others might term &ldquo;heavy-handed&rdquo;.  We will bring forward an amendment on a code of practice for labour inspectors.  This would be fair because we do not want people hounding employers by, for example, having labour inspectors arriving to do a full audit at unearthly hours or during difficult times when two or three weddings or functions are taking place on the premises.  These can be done at normal times with notification.</P>
        <P>If a labour inspector, however, has a genuine belief that there is exploitation, not only in the context of wages and conditions but also with regard the Employment Permits Act, he or she might have to arrive unannounced, as otherwise a second lot of books might come out as opposed to the first lot.  As this can happen, we must provide for it.  In general, the code of practice will be meritorious of support from all Deputies.  We must have broad understanding that these are public sector workers going about their lawful duty to ensure there is compliance.  They do no more nor no less.</P>

        <P>However, if heavy-handed tactics, as were described by some Deputies, are being used, we must take this on board and this is why we will bring forward an amendment on the code of practice.  At least the inspectors will know they have obligations just as we expect members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to behave in a courteous and professional manner when dealing with the public.  We do not expect anything less of any other person dealing with the public on behalf of the State.</P>
        <P>I hope the commentary on the legislation outside the House in the coming days will take account of the fact that nothing will change in the context of employers&rsquo; obligations to keep records.  There is already a corpus of legislation under which they are obliged to keep records and pay rates and conditions agreed under employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  If this Bill were not passed employers would be still obliged to deal with these, and this information must be repeated on occasion.</P>
        <P>We have had cases where labour inspectors went into hotels, requested the books for audit purposes and found people were not paid double-time for Sundays.  It is a fact that many people were not paid double-time for Sundays in rural Ireland.  Employers are legally obliged to pay double-time for Sundays but it was not enforced.  Backdating these arrears put much pressure on people.  The issue is that this money is not that of Deputies Billy Kelleher, Se&aacute;n Connick, <Col N="50"/>Joe Costello or Leo Varadkar, it is the employee&rsquo;s money and he or she is entitled to it.  We cannot negotiate people&rsquo;s rights on a daily basis.  They are entitled to these arrears and if they wish to seek redress we must uphold and vindicate their rights and entitlements.  The concern was with regard to rates of pay and not enforcement of those rates.</P>
        <P>This Bill was a key commitment of Towards 2016 and the social partners were insistent on this.  It was broadly discussed with the social partners and the Bill has been in gestation for a long time.  There were much toing and froing between the social partners in this area.  The Bill was published last year and was slow to come to the D&aacute;il simply because the social partners wanted clarification on issues.  It is hoped the social partners will see as genuine our commitment to protect workers and to ensure their rights and obligations.  Under the Bill, employees have obligations.  If everybody adhered to the law of the land on rates of pay and conditions it would not give advantage to those who exploit or underpay workers and undermine businesses which lawfully pay workers.  This issue has been raised with me by many hotels and restaurants which pay the rate but know a business down the road does not.  We must ensure we have clarity on this issue.</P>
        <P>This was a genuinely interesting debate.  We can accept that nobody in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann wants to see workers exploited and, equally, they want tacit acceptance that businesses are under pressure.  If a business is under pressure and it has cut its cost to the bare minimum in terms of overheads, commercial rates and costs to banks and Revenue and the only variable remaining is wages, at what stage does one state enough is enough?  One cannot keep trading on the backs of workers.  There comes a time when a business is just not profitable and one cannot expect workers to go to the nth degree and work for nothing to keep a business going.</P>
        <P>This is a challenging time but the country should be proud of what we achieved with regard to the minimum wage which is &euro;8.65, the second highest in Europe.  We as a society, a Government and a Parliament have stated that we value fair remuneration for a fair day&rsquo;s work and that we accept this as a modern standard belief.  We should be proud of this.  I would have concerns about any undermining of this.  How far does one go towards a worker effectively working for nothing?  We can discuss this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar raised the issue of NERA costs and benefits in the context of the regulatory impact analysis which was carried out and has been available on the Department&rsquo;s website since the Bill was published.  If the Deputy clicks into it he will have seen it before I am finished to see whether it is of benefit to him.</P>
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I did look at it but there are no figures in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>We find that figures can be a very risky business.  The provisions of the Bill arise directly from the process of consultation negotiation as referred to in the context of Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>With regard to NERA being a quango, an advisory board was established and a former Member of the House, John Dennehy, was appointed chair of this board.  I have known John Dennehy for a long time and he has a wealth of experience in that he was a member of a trade union for many years and was a shop steward.  He was also involved in health and safety in Irish Steel.  He is a former Lord Mayor of Cork, a former chair of the Southern Health Board and a former Member of this House.</P>
        <P>There is no remuneration for people on the advisory board.  They just give of their time.  The idea was to get a cross-section of people from employer and employee groups to harness expertise, and to have a chair with experience on both sides to bring them together to advise <Col N="51"/>NERA on an ongoing basis without getting involved in the day to day details.  This advisory group does not constitute an onerous cost to the Exchequer.  Views were being put about that its members are on large sums of money. I want to clarify that this is inaccurate.  It will remain staffed by civil servants but at a sufficient arm&rsquo;s length from the Department for good operational reasons.  The advisory board has drawn from a great wealth of experience, so the compliance message is put across to employers.  No fees are paid to the advisory board.</P>
        <P>The issue about quangos must be kept in context.  The reason it was set up on a statutory basis is that we want to ensure it is slightly removed from the Department.  The Minister will not be taking the prosecutions, but NERA itself will do so.  The Bill puts NERA on the same statutory footing as other organisations.  It allows the body to work in close co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is a positive aspect, as it allows those bodies to undertake joint operations and pool resources and information.  It can then address concerns in a more effective manner, which most people will welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies Fleming and Penrose expressed concerns about the level of accountability to the Oireachtas of the director of NERA.  Deputy Fleming also questioned whether the restrictions placed on the director for 12 months following the cessation of his appointment were appropriate.  Section 25 ensures that the director is accountable to the Oireachtas by being required to appear before Oireachtas committees on request.  The 12 month restriction placed on the director under section 9 of the Bill would arise only if he or she resigned or was removed from office.  We might look at this on Committee Stage to make sure there is accountability.  We do not want the director before us every day of the week, asking him or her to explain a prosecution before the court.  However, we will have him or her before committees to explain policy and to bring accountability on broader issues.  A code of practice for inspectors can allow for these issues to be raised in a discussion with the director before an Oireachtas committee.</P>
        <P>If Deputies feel there is not enough accountability in NERA, we can re-examine the matter.  However, the purpose of the Bill is to remove the authority from the Minister and the Department and to allow for a statutory set up of the authority in order that it can take prosecutions in its own name.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar and others raised issues about employers.  We are seeking to remove some of the more severe sanctions where employers have ended up with criminal convictions for what we would consider lesser offences.  We can have a detailed discussion about that on Committee Stage, and we are very open to examining that area.  We need a strong Bill, but some offences may be dropped.  I hope that satisfies those Deputies who expressed concern.  We cannot water down a Bill to a stage where it is incapable of operating as a deterrent.  There must be a deterrent and sanction at the end of the day.  We have had a very beneficial debate.  If there are any points people wish to make, we are open to listening to them on Committee Stage, but the broad thrust of the Bill is the same.</P>
        <P>Different issues have been raised by many Deputies, such as on-the-spot fines, the accountability of NERA and section 45.  In order that people can ask themselves whether this Bill is before us for the right reasons, I will outline a few recent cases.  In the case of an employer and a domestic worker, the domestic worker was given a contract of employment setting out the minimum rate of pay and specifying a 39 hour week.  The employee alleged that she was required to work in excess of 90 hours per week with no breaks, and that the minimum wage per hour was not paid.  NERA investigated this complaint and arrears of &euro;10,000 were paid to that employee.  That is a substantial sum of money to a person on the minimum wage.  It was <Col N="52"/>gross exploitation and that is why we must be conscious that this is happening in our communities.</P>
        <P>Another minimum wage case involves a tyre sales and puncture repair company.  The employees alleged that they were being paid &euro;5 per hour, even though the minimum wage is &euro;8.65 per hour.  The employer refused to co-operate with the inspection process or with any written requests.  He stated that he did not know the names of his employees, that they received &euro;50 per day, but he would not specify the hours worked.  No records were provided despite repeated requests.  The only avenue currently open to NERA is to take a prosecution against the employer for failure to produce records.  The current maximum fine for such an offence is a little over &euro;1,900.  I have many other examples involving construction companies and registered employment agreements.  This is what is happening, and we need to be conscious of that.</P>
        <P>I have delayed the House long enough.  I thank the Deputies and the officials in the Department who have worked long hours to bring this Bill before the D&aacute;il.  We are understanding of all views in the House, but the fundamental purpose of the Bill is to ensure  we have compliance with all the existing employment rights legislation.  The Bill does not put any extra employment law on the statute books.  It only enforces that law.  I look forward to Committee Stage.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.  I probably went over my time, but I think there were important points that needed to be made.  When we are discussing this on Committee Stage in the bowels of Leinster House, we can have a genuine debate.  The social partners have agreed on this, and it is important that the Bill has got their support.  It is being put forward for all the right reasons, and I look forward to debating it on Committee Stage.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  if he plans to change the electricity price regulation structure here to allow the ESB to compete on price in the domestic household market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[10713/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission for Energy Regulation has statutory responsibility for <Col N="53"/>the regulation of electricity prices under the Electricity Regulation Act.   In 2006 the CER ended the regulation of ESB tariffs for large energy users.  Some 90% of business has now switched to independent suppliers.  The CER has made clear that it intends to exit from the regulation of ESB retail prices when sufficient competition has taken hold in the domestic market.  This is in line with overall EU requirements for the internal energy market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the fact that the benefits of competition in electricity supply, which have previously been confined to large industrial and commercial customers, are finally available to domestic consumers.  The entry into the domestic electricity market of two new suppliers, Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is Energy, demonstrates that Government and regulatory policy to encourage competition in electricity generation and supply is paying dividends for consumers.</P>
        <P>The independent suppliers are offering discounts of between 10% and 14% on ESB tariffs.  These discounts will apply even after the 10% reduction to ESB prices now proposed by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Customers will then be able to avail of reductions of up to 24% on current ESB tariffs.</P>
        <P>The independent suppliers are also offering domestic consumers fresh choices, such as the proportion of renewable electricity they purchase, as well as alternative billing arrangements.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, domestic customers have been switching to the independent suppliers in unprecedented numbers.  However, it is important to remember there are close to 2 million domestic electricity customers and that ESB still retains some 95% of the market share.</P>
        <P>The regulation of ESB tariffs will only continue until competition has taken firm hold in the market.  Energy price regulation is designed to ensure that a dominant player cannot engage in uncompetitive, short-term pricing practices, which could undermine or drive out emerging competition.  The CER will continue to review overall energy tariff structures over the coming months taking account of global fuel prices, the importance of regulatory and market certainty for the energy sector, and the competitiveness challenges facing industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is it still necessary to keep a set price in the domestic electricity supply market?  Why is the Government preventing ESB from competing with the two new competitors that have entered the market in recent months?  Will the Minister of State correct himself?  He stated the CER is responsible for regulation policy but it is not.  The CER is responsible for setting prices; the Government decides on policy on the advice of CER.  Could the Minister of State give a timescale for the introduction of a directive that will require the CER to allow for open competition in the domestic electricity supply market so we can see these three major companies competing with one another to drive prices down?  Currently, regulation is keeping ESB prices artificially high because it is not allowed to compete aggressively with two other companies that have entered the market and that are capable of dealing with that competition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agree competition is necessary and that ESB had a monopoly for too long.  Both Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is, however, are recent entrants to the domestic electricity market.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy has advised that in excess of 80,000 customers have switched and while that volume of change-over exceeded expectations, the numbers remain small in comparison to the domestic market of 2 million consumers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>How many customers must switch before the Government takes action?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention was to make it attractive for other companies to enter the market and provide competition.  To achieve that we had to provide a guarantee for new <Col N="54"/>entrants.  If ESB was allowed to compete on price in the early days of competition in the domestic market, it could seriously undermine the new market entrants.  For that reason the new entrants had to be given some certainty about the future.  It was important to give them an indication that it was a viable proposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What percentage of the domestic electricity supply market must new entrants take before ESB is allowed to compete with them?  Currently we are deliberately undermining ESB market share in the domestic power supply market to facilitate competition.  Currently it is a no-brainer; why would anyone stay with ESB if he could get the exact same service for 10% to 14% less?  A phone call is all that is needed.  The ESB is being put at a significant disadvantage deliberately by the Government and the CER.  How long will that policy remain in place?  From what the Minister of State has said, the only way to measure it is a percentage of market share going to the opposition.  What is that percentage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give a percentage but it will be reviewed as the market develops.  At this stage it is not necessary to decide what the figure will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESB might like to know what it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it would but it was important to have these measures in place if we were going introduce competition.  The regulator admitted in recent consultation papers its intention to withdraw from regulation when sufficient competition develops in the market.  Competition is in its infancy and we will have to see how it grows.  We are talking about 80,000 customers in a few weeks compared to 2 million in the market place.  More progress is necessary and it is too early to make any decisions.  It is a short-term strategy until there is real competition in the market place.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  his views, in the context of the Broadcasting Bill, on setting up one regulator, combining ComReg and the authority, particularly in view of the economic climate and the convergence of technologies taking place in the communications area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[10717/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Broadcasting Bill 2008 proposes the establishment of a single content regulator, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which will encompass the existing functions of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and any remaining content regulatory functions of the RTE Authority.</P>
        <P>In formulating the Bill consideration was given to the question of whether there was merit in amalgamating the Commission for Communications Regulation &mdash; ComReg &mdash; and the proposed new content regulator.  However on reflection it was decided not to proceed with such a combination.</P>
        <P>The principal rationale for such a decision is that the two regulators address very different sectors and as a consequence require very different skill sets.  In essence the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is intended to be a content regulator whilst ComReg is a network or distribution regulator.</P>
        <P>Whilst convergence is undoubtedly happening, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and ComReg will continue into the future to address separate questions, for example, how we <Col N="55"/>encourage Irish language programming or objective and impartial current affairs journalism in the case of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as opposed to how we ensure the development of next generation telecommunications infrastructure in the case of ComReg.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt there needs to be close liaison between the two regulators, as is the case at present between the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and ComReg, for example in the allocation of spectrum for radio services and digital terrestrial television services.  In addition there may be scope for the proposed Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and ComReg entering into an agreement to share common services in an effort to achieve administrative savings.  Indeed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, although two distinct statutory bodies, have an agreement to share services, with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland providing staff to service the administrative needs of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.</P>
        <P>While different arrangements may be required in the future, at present we are best served by two separate regulators.  The matter, however, will be kept under ongoing review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State accept that other countries are adopting a different approach by having one regulator dealing with content, communications and technologies?  It is an affront to people who are being forced to pay a heavy price for the economic crisis to find that the Government is insisting on pursuing the establishment of another regulator in the communications area, which will involve a costly levy on broadcasters, including RTE.  Is the Minister of State aware of the terrible straits RTE is currently in due to a &euro;68 million shortfall in advertising revenue this year?  The Minister of State should ensure that this legislation will not be unpicked as soon as it is passed, which is essentially the message in his reply.  We should do this correctly by pooling resources in one regulator and recognising that convergence is the future, if not the present.  We should not continue on this crazy plan of having two regulators, which is costly to the industry and ineffective in terms of streamlined, joined-up Government.  The Minister of State should submit that case to the Minister and the Government generally. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We gave that serious consideration and while a good case might be made for joining the two together, weighing up the pros and cons, it was decided that at this stage we would not amalgamate the two, but have two separate regulators.  The forum on broadcasting, which was set up in 2002 and is the genesis for the current Broadcasting Bill, recommended what we are doing.  It also recommended certain co-operation and liaison between both groups.  One can argue a good case for amalgamation, but taking everything into consideration we are making the right decision.  Two separate sets of knowledge are required.  In essence, the commissioner for communications regulation is a network regulator, while the RTE authority, the BCI and BCC are content regulators.  In a single organisation there is always a danger that broadcasting regulation might not receive the level of attention it is due in comparison to the sheer size of the telecommunications sector.  The turnover of the latter sector is a multiple of the broadcasting sector&rsquo;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the experience elsewhere, if the Minister of State looks at it.  When this was considered, the economy still appeared to be doing well, whereas it is in a desperate state now.  Surely that should inform the Minister of State&rsquo;s judgment.  We will move to converge both regulators at some point in the future.  Quite apart from the economic argument, we must also meet the needs of changing technologies by adopting a modern day approach instead of one that applied seven years ago.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>  if he is satisfied that the mineral oil tax relief scheme II is adequate to develop an indigenous bio-fuel industry; if it will stimulate investment in Irish bio-fuel plants; his views on changes to this scheme or if he is considering changes for the next phase of this scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[10714/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The bio-fuels mineral oil tax relief schemes resulted in 18 projects being awarded excise relief for the years 2005 to 2010.  The schemes were designed as an interim measure to enhance the level of bio-fuels in the fuel mix and to encourage the development of an indigenous bio-fuels industry.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s bio-energy action plan, which was published in 2007, made clear that a national bio-fuels obligation would replace the relief schemes by the time those schemes came to a close at the end of 2010.  Proposals are being finalised for the introduction of the obligation scheme next year.  Another excise scheme will not be introduced.</P>
        <P>Since the start of the relief schemes there has been a steady increase in bio-fuels used in Ireland, albeit from a very low base.  Prior to the introduction of the schemes, market penetration of bio-fuels was almost non-existent.  In 2007, the latest year for which figures are available, market penetration had risen to 0.6%.  Continued increase in penetration is anticipated in the 2008 statistics.</P>
        <P>At least five bio-fuels plants have been constructed or redeveloped on foot of excise relief granted under the scheme.  A number of others are either at an advanced stage of planning, or have received planning permission.</P>
        <P>It is the case that, generally, the European bio-fuels industry has experienced difficulties with a prolonged period of price volatility culminating in recent negative trends, which have seen the price of mineral diesel falling considerably.  This has been exacerbated by rises in the price of feedstock for bio-fuels production.  These two factors have caused severe competitive difficulties for the European and Irish bio-fuels sector.  In addition, the availability of US subsidised bio-diesel, known as B99, has placed considerable commercial pressure on the European and Irish industries.</P><Col N="57"/>
        <P>In this overall context, progress on constructing all of the facilities benefiting under the mineral oil tax relief scheme has been inevitably slow, despite some early successes.  The Department has been working closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to support official EU measures to counter the US export subsidy accorded to B99.  A response from the EU Commission was made today, which I am sure will be well received both by European and Irish producers.  Both EU action in the short term and the introduction of the bio-fuels obligation in 2010 should provide the Irish bio-fuels sector with the certainty it needs to invest and grow its business in a sustainable way.</P>

	<P>One of the problems of doing this on a Thursday afternoon, particularly this week, is that one gets the distinct impression that nobody is listening.  Nonetheless, this is really important.  Will the Minister of State inform the House how much money the State has lost in tax relief on imported fuel under this scheme since 2006?  Can he provide an estimate?  I expect it is well over &euro;100 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said there were 18 successful applicants.  Under the award scheme exercise, relief was applicable in the two big volume areas &mdash; 306 million litres of bioethanol and 290 million litres of bio-diesel.  It would be very welcome if we were producing even a large proportion of that volume in Ireland.  Of the 18 successful applicants, how many plants are being or have been constructed in the bioethanol and bio-diesel areas?  My understanding is that there is only one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>

	<P>There was always going to have to be imports.  This is an interim measure, not a permanent solution.  The US undercutting European and Irish companies made it difficult for the sector.</P>
        <P>Today, the Commission announced its decision to impose an anti-dumping duty on US biodiesel.  While the regulation in question is long and complex, the bottom line is that some importing companies will be hit harder than others.

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to get at the fact that there are a relatively small number of companies which are importing large volumes of bio-diesel into Ireland to blend it with fuel that is sold at the pumps.  I do not have a problem with the importation but I have an issue <Col N="58"/>with the State subsidising it.  As a result, we are not seeing the development of a biodiesel industry in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Have any of the companies successful under this scheme built or intend to build bio-fuel production plants in Ireland?  Does the Government plan to re-evaluate the project so as to encourage an Irish industry rather than subsiding imported biodiesel which is not environmentally friendly as it has to be transported across the Atlantic?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Plants have been built in Ireland.  At European level, we have set a 10% target of renewable energy in transport by 2020.  Bio-fuels will make a significant contribution to the achievement of that target.  It will be reviewed on an ongoing basis as more evidence comes to light of the effects of bio-fuels on world food markets and as new technologies come on stream.</P>
        <P>This relief scheme was very much an interim measure.  The bio-fuels obligation is the key and will be put in place through legislation next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> his views on whether the export tariff recently announced to facilitate the sale of electricity onto the grid from small domestically owned microgeneration is sufficient to kick start significant investment in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[10715/09]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister recently launched the microgeneration programme, which is being operated by ESB Customer Supply and supported by ESB Networks.  The programme will provide up to 4,000 domestic customers investing in microscale projects with a financial payment for electricity exported back to the grid.  It will also enable two way metering to be installed without additional charge to the customer.  The electricity producer will be paid a price of 19 cent per kilowatt-hour, which will help to offset the start up costs.  The microtechnologies in question include wind and hydro as well as combined heat and power.</P>
        <P>It is the case that microscale electricity production will benefit the participating customers up-front by offsetting their purchase of electricity from their electricity suppliers.  The additional incentive of a guaranteed price for electricity exported back to the grid is a significant encouragement to invest.  This competitive feed-in tariff will apply to the first 4,000 microgeneration installations countrywide over the next three years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sustainable Energy Ireland has also launched a microgeneration pilot programme involving research and field trials, including support for between 50 and 60 installations on a pilot basis, of microscale projects.  The field trials will address a range of issues including grid connection and technical standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P>The Minister is satisfied the guaranteed price under the new programme and the grant support available from SEI for testing technical issues will attract sufficient market interest to ensure investment and underpin the steady development of a national micro generation capability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s move as a start to what can be a whole new industry.  Ireland should be aspiring to have a large percentage of its households generating their own power in an efficient and environmentally sustainable manner, selling it back to the grid at night-time when not using power.</P>
        <P>However, other European countries offer far more attractive incentives to encourage people to invest in microgeneration in the home.  For example, in France the home electricity producer is paid a price of 30 cent per kilowatt-hour with a 50% tax credit for installation costs.  An incentive of 42 cent per kilowatt-hour has resulted in Spain being ranked fourth in the world in home microgeneration.  In Italy, the feed-in tariff ranges from 45 cent to 49 cent per kilowatt-hour with up to 80% of the capital costs available under grant aid.</P>
        <P>Ireland, with a Green Minister who aspires to decentralise power generation into people&rsquo;s homes, farms and small businesses, is giving a miserly tariff of 19 cent.  Will the Government examine increasing this rate to give the microgeneration industry a boost?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Deputy welcomes the scheme.  We have worked with the energy regulator and the ESB in developing the scheme.  It is in its early stages but has the potential for enormous development.  With the current difficult economic times, people are looking for new opportunities.  This is one area that could present opportunities for families across the country.</P>
        <P>On the cost, it should be remembered the ESB will be providing the import-export metering free of charge to the first 4,000 domestic customers installing microgenerators over the next three years.  Comparing prices with other countries sometimes does not tell the real story.  It is a relatively new scheme and it will be interesting to see the take-up for the scheme.  If people believe it is worthwhile, they will get involved.  I believe it will appear as an attractive scheme to many.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The price will persuade people to invest or not.  It is a commercial decision.  Will the Minister of State agree that the roll-out phase of a programme such as this is the time to get a high return on investment to kick-start it?  We can return to 19 cent per kilowatt-hour in five years time when the scheme is up and running with 15% of households producing their own power.    Will the Minister of State accept Ireland is very poorly positioned in the context of how it benchmarks itself against other countries that are serious with regard to decentralising power generation and encouraging micro-generation?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We are embarking on a process which probably should have commenced 20 or 30 years ago.  However, it is not possible to turn back the clock.  We have made what will prove to be an attractive proposition to many farming households.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have in my possession information relating to the prices charged in other countries.  The price we are proposing was not plucked out of thin air.  We devised the scheme in consultation with the regulator and the ESB and we are of the view that it will be quite attractive.  It is only natural that changes will have to be made and the scheme will be reviewed on a regular basis.  If the rate of take-up is not sufficiently high and if there is a need to make the scheme more attractive, we will take action.</P>

	<P>My Department is responsible for overseeing general policy and the State shareholder interest in a number of commercial state bodies, namely, the ESB, EirGrid, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, Bord na M&oacute;na, the INPC, RTE, TG4 and An Post.  These bodies employ in the region of 23,300 people and had, according to the latest published figures, a total turnover of some &euro;6.7 billion in 2007.  They play a critical role and, in most cases, hold strategic national infrastructure in the sectors in which they operate.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy on the matter, the Minister has no plans to sell off or privatise State companies under the remit of the Department as part of a revenue-raising programme for Government.  The shareholder priority with respect to these companies is to ensure profitable commercial operations, competitive provision of services to the economy as a whole, nationwide delivery of services in certain cases and a strongly positive contribution to the strategic development of the sectors in which they operate, in areas such as infrastructure development and environmental sustainability.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>

	<P>We also have no intention of selling off any of the companies.  Even if it was our intention, I cannot think of a worse environment in which to contemplate their sale. <Col N="61"/> We attach great importance to these companies and consideration has not been given to selling any of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister of State says regarding the intention of the State to refrain from selling assets such as gas pipeline infrastructure and electricity infrastructure.  However, my original question was somewhat more specific in respect of the actual companies involved.  The State owns three or four energy companies.  I am trying to establish whether the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department or the Department of Finance are considering raising money through the sale or partial sale of these or any of the other companies to which he referred.</P>

	<P>I can only provide the Deputy with the information at my disposal.  While I appreciate the Exchequer currently has a pressing need for funds, as I stated earlier, I could not think of a worse time to be contemplating the sale of State resources.  We have not given consideration to selling any of the bodies that come under the remit of my Department nor is it our intention to do so.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 6 and 48 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is giving high priority to supporting the development of Ireland&rsquo;s ocean energy potential.  Not only will ocean energy contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets, it has considerable potential for inward investment and enterprise activity in support of economic renewal.</P>
        <P>The multi-annual ocean energy package, which I launched last year, involves a number of initiatives, namely, the establishment of the ocean energy development unit based with Sustainable Energy Ireland, the creation of a state-of-the-art national ocean energy facility at University College Cork; the development of a grid-connected wave energy test site off the west coast; the establishment of an ocean energy prototype fund; and the introduction of a new feed-in tariff under the REFIT scheme for wave and tidal technologies of &euro;220 per megawatt hour.  I am pleased to confirm that all initiatives under the package are well under way and are being implemented with the full involvement of stakeholders.  Some &euro;7 million has been allocated by the ocean energy development unit to the ocean energy package in 2009.  This is in line with projected expenditure this year, subject to obtaining Department of Finance sanction on a quarterly basis.</P><Col N="62"/>
        <P>The ocean energy development unit has launched the industry prototype development fund.  To date, 20 expressions of interest, leading to seven firm proposals, have been submitted by developers.  Contracts for the funding of three projects will be issued within the coming weeks.  Four proposals are currently the subject of technical and business evaluation.  Funding decisions will be made in light of these evaluations.  Expenditure on the prototype fund in 2009 is projected to be at least &euro;4 million.</P>
        <P>The Government has set a target of 500 MW from ocean energy by 2020.  At present, there are no ocean energy devices connected to the grid in Ireland.  This technology is still very much in early development.  Current assessments show that across the globe only a small number of test projects, totalling under 10 MW in size, are connected to the grid.  The ocean energy development unit, in partnership with the Marine Institute and ESBI, undertook an extensive process over the past two years to identify the most suitable wave energy test site.  The development partnership will now develop a grid-connected site off Annagh, County Mayo.  This will test operational pre-commercial wave energy devices directly connected to the electricity network.</P>
        <P>The project team is undertaking detailed technical consultation with prospective industrial users of the facility.  It is also completing engineering specifications and progressing onshore and offshore lease applications, network connection and necessary onshore works.  Expenditure on the project this year is expected to be at least &euro;2 million.  The project is scheduled to be completed by 2010, subject to external factors including offshore sea conditions during the development phase.</P>
        <P>The ocean energy development unit is also working with UCC to upgrade the existing wave basin located at the hydraulics and maritime research centre, HMRC, at UCC.  This wave basin provides research and testing facilities for a variety of offshore purposes.  The upgrade of the existing facility will include new wave generating equipment, new experimental test rigs, improved workshop facilities and advanced computer solutions for numerical analysis and modelling.  Expenditure on the facility in the current year is estimated at &euro;1 million.  Proposals for a new national ocean test facility, NOTF, will be developed by 2012 as part of a proposed maritime and energy research centre to be located adjacent to the National Maritime College at Ringaskiddy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>When one cuts through the spin, one can only judge the priority the Government gives to a particular area by the amount it is willing to spend.  This time last year the Government, with considerable fanfare, launched an ocean energy programme and stated that &euro;26 million would be spent over three years.  Last year it spent &euro;1 million and the Minister of State indicated it plans to spend &euro;7 million this year.  The only new information he provided is that this money will be subject to sanction from the Department of Finance on a quarterly basis.  By the end of the second year of the three-year programme, the Government will only have spent &euro;8 million.  It is supposed to spend &euro;26 million on the entire programme.  The Minister of State has indicated that even the &euro;7 million for this year is not certain.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State in a position to indicate that the entire &euro;7 million will be spent this year?  Can the Minister also offer some certainty about fulfilling the commitment that was made of expenditure totalling &euro;26 million by the end of next year?  Of all the industries that require a boost, this is a potentially huge employer and in the current environment it is one of the areas that justifies significant capital expenditure.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="63"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy judges the priority the Government gives to something by the amount of money it spends on it.  There is probably some truth in that.  The Deputy mentioned this on the last Question Time and the Minister explained clearly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation is worse now because the Minister has just told us it is subject to Department of Finance sanction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  For capital expenditure the Department of Finance is taking a hands-on approach.  It is doing that in the interest of the country to ensure that what we are spending needs to be spent and that we are getting good value for the spend.  I am being honest with the Deputy.  I agree that there is huge potential in ocean energy.  A study carried out by Bacon/ESBI calculated that up to 1,900 jobs could be created in the sector by 2020 if we invest in ocean energy technology.  A great deal of work is taking place and our objective is to support research and applied research leading to full scale commercialisation of the technology.  As I mentioned earlier, however, the technology has not yet been fully developed but it offers huge potential.  We have been working on trying to put the nuts and bolts together and on putting a good team in place to ensure that we maximise the potential that exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a certain amount of concern at the approach now being adopted to the &euro;26 million that was announced not long ago with such positive statements by the Minister.  As I understand it, the only Irish prototype that is connected to a grid is connected to the British grid.  Are the 20 applications all of Irish origin?  The Minister said that approximately &euro;4 million can be provided for the seven successful applicants.  Can he confirm that the money will be available to them or is he saying that it is up to the Department of Finance?  This is pioneering work and there must be some certainty for people who are, in effect, taking a step into the dark.  Is the Minister saying the &euro;4 million grant aid is subject to the Department of Finance stranglehold?  Looking ahead, can the Minister say when he expects the first project to be connected to the Irish grid?  What is the calculated date for connection?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>So far there have been 20 expressions of interest, leading to seven firm proposals being submitted by developers.  Contracts for funding of three of those projects will be issued within a few weeks.  Four proposals are currently the subject of technical and business evaluation.  Funding decisions will be made in light of these evaluations.  The expenditure on the prototype fund in 2009 is projected to be at least &euro;4 million.  With regard to the moneys, there is little point in me repeating what I have said about finance.  Obviously, given our difficult financial situation, the Department is taking a keen interest in what Departments are spending.</P>
        <P>The point of view of the Department is that ocean energy offers great potential.  It needs investment and we will make every effort to ensure that not only do we have the right people in place, but also that we provide the necessary funds.  The supports we are providing this year include &euro;1 million towards the world class state-of-the-art national ocean energy facility in UCC and &euro;2 million to support and develop the grid connected wave energy site near Belmullet in County Mayo, which is very important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the Minister is being blunt and honest about the funding, will he clarify if the announced &euro;26 million over a three year period still stands?  If the Minister spends everything it is planned to spend by the end of this year, and hopefully the Department of Finance will sanction it, it will amount to &euro;8 million.  Does that mean there is still &euro;18 million that the Government plans to spend next year?  People need to know this.  They are investing their own money as well as the grant aid from the Government.  This research and development area has exciting prospects but people will not invest if they do not have certainty on State <Col N="64"/>finance.  If the &euro;26 million is not available or is revised, can the Minister please say so?  People can plan on that basis.  Can the Minister say if, next year, the Government commitment of &euro;18 million of the three year programme will be forthcoming?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an issue about certainty.  With regard to the contracts that will be signed in a couple of weeks with three contenders, is there a clause in the contract stating that moneys will be subject to approval by the Department of Finance?  I understand that an bord snip nua has not yet met with the Minister or the Department.  Is it possible that recommendations would come from that group advising that this fund be slashed?  The fund appears to be vulnerable, at least to attack, because of its nature.  What assurance can the Minister offer?  People are investing their money and commitment in developing an important energy resource and they should not be treated in a way the Minister appears to foresee they might be treated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all probably vulnerable to attack in these times.  With regard to the announcement of &euro;26 million, that figure was given as the amount required to be invested in the short term to develop the industry and provide the type of support needed for research and applied research leading to the full scale commercialisation of the technology.  One of the first companies operating in this area was Wavebob.  A significant Swedish player has come on board for a joint operation with Wavebob to try to develop the technology further.</P>

        <Quest> the progress being made on agreeing and signing the management contract for the MANs II infrastructure; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The engagement of a management services entity, MSE II, is the subject of a procurement process and is currently in the contract negotiation phase with the preferred bidder, eNet.  I expect that to conclude by the end of March.  Because it is a procurement process, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</P>
        <P>All completed phase II networks are being managed, maintained and operated on an interim basis by the technical services firm, Magnum Opus, on behalf of the Department.  Magnum Opus will continue to manage the phase II MANs until such time as an MSE II is engaged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of the 60 metropolitan area networks built under phase II are operating currently?  Most of them have been there for more than a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 58 MANs covering 64 towns have been completed during 2007 and 2008.  The remaining two MANs towns of Edenderry and Kinsale will be substantially completed during 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked how many are actually operating.  We have spent &euro;80 million putting that infrastructure in the ground.  I am asking how many of the 60 MANs that are in the ground are actually lit up and operating, providing broadband services to the towns for which they were built and, most importantly, giving the State a return?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Under phase I of the metropolitan area networks programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Deputy Coveney should allow the Minister to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just saying that under phase I, a total of 27 have been constructed and all 27 are operational and open for business.  Four phase II MANs are being used by services providers.  They are in Killarney, Tralee, Longford and Carrigaline.  A number of other requests have been received from service providers and they are being considered.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="66"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to be helpful in this area, but I have raised this issue consistently since last July.  The reason all of the phase I MANs are operating successfully and giving a good return to the State is that they are being managed properly by a management entity.  As it happens that is eNet, but the company is irrelevant.  It is giving a good return to the State on investment.</P>
        <P>The management contract for MANs phase II was due to be finished by the end of last summer and the preferred bidder happened to be the same company that is managing MANs phase I, but that is largely irrelevant.  Does the Minister agree the issue is the delay by Government to put in place a proper management contract for the 60 metropolitan area networks under phase II, which is preventing them from being managed properly and therefore used properly to give a return to the State at a time when we could do with sweating those assets and getting a significant return, which is feasible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that it is vital that we get a return to the State but the engagement of a management services entity is the subject of a procurement process.</P>

	<P>What is the delay?</P>

	<P>As I said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is baffling why it is taking so long, especially when the Department has already had the experience with phase I.  Perhaps the Minister can bring us through the process going back to last July.  What exactly was involved?  Were there a lot of meetings or is there a lot of documentation?  What exactly went on over that period that it should take so long?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, for a variety of reasons these matters often drag on for a little longer than one would want.  I do not have specific information at my disposal relating to the number of meetings that took place.  I will make an effort to get it and pass it on to the Deputy.  The process has taken longer than we would have wished but the good news, which we will all welcome, is that it will be concluded within a few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister not curious about this?  Surely he has an interest in the way things work in his Department.  Has he never ask why in God&rsquo;s name it is taking forever to do a relatively simple contract?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We spent three hours yesterday in a committee with Eircom discussing the problems with rolling out next generation broadband infrastructure into rural Ireland.  The State has spent &euro;80 million putting in place that infrastructure and we are not lighting it up.  It is nine months since the preferred tender was chosen and we have still not put in place a contract to make it happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>People may have been unhappy with the lack of progress in the early stages but more recently we have made significant progress in the provision of broadband throughout the country.  A recent development in regard to the national broadband scheme <Col N="67"/>will be welcomed throughout the country.  We have put in place the necessary investment to ensure we do not have a digital divide in the country and that people have access to new technology.  We will ensure in so far as is possible that everybody has an opportunity to avail of that new technology.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>At the request of the Minister a number of weeks ago, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, undertook an urgent review of options to bring forward a reduction in energy prices for business and domestic consumers.  The need for an early review <Col N="68"/>was underlined by the various cost pressures facing Irish businesses in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P>The proposed decisions on the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is tariffs to apply from May next were published for consultation by the CER last week.  The CER has concluded that the best way to deliver a reduction in electricity prices in the short term is through the deferral of both transmission and distribution network revenues.  A total of &euro;165 million of network revenue will be deferred for five months and recovered over the following year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The exact reduction to be seen by a particular customer or category of customer will depend on his or her pattern of energy use.  It will tend to average at approximately 10%.  The reduction in electricity costs now is bringing forward the reduction that consumers would otherwise see in October due to the fall in fossil fuel prices.  The approach of the regulator ensures that the benefits of lower prices are passed on to all customers, of all suppliers, in a way that does not distort the market.  In regard to gas prices, the regulator concluded that downward trends in global gas prices and higher sales of gas by BGE during the cold winter months, would allow a significant reduction in BGE&rsquo;s regulated prices to residential and small industrial and commercial customers.</P>
        <P>In the normal course, this reduction would come into effect next October, which is the start of the gas year.  However, in view of the exceptional difficulties currently facing the economy, the CER proposes to bring forward the price reduction to 1 May next.  That will result in a 12% price reduction for domestic and SME gas users.</P>
        <P>Further energy price reductions in 2009 will depend on trends in fossil fuel prices, particularly gas and coal, which are still the largest components of electricity generated in Ireland.  The regulator will continue to closely monitor global price trends in the coming months.  On current trends, the regulator has advised that there potentially may be scope for a further reduction in gas prices in October.  In the case of electricity, the regulator is bringing forward the entire reduction now, as opposed to having any reduction in the autumn.</P>
        <P>The regulator has stated that the regulated prices are currently set at a level that is cost reflective.  However, if either ESB or BGE can demonstrate to the regulator that they can provide electricity and gas at lower cost then the regulator will permit them to reduce their prices.  The regulator has also made clear the intent to exit from regulated prices as competition takes hold in the market.  The regulator has already ceased regulating tariffs for large energy users.  The majority of these have now switched away from ESB to independent suppliers and negotiate their own specific arrangements.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt we will see an end to regulated tariffs as soon as the market power of the dominant player is sufficiently reduced.  It is a matter for the regulator to judge when the moment is right.  The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 is not prescriptive in terms of the timing and frequency of decisions by CER on charges by ESB customer supply.  The legislation does not preclude the regulator reviewing electricity prices very regularly.  As its two-phase structure adopted last year and its current tariff proposal have shown, the regulator is showing flexibility in its approach to tariff regulation in the interests of all energy consumers, without distorting the market.</P>
        <P>The entry of BGE and Airtricity to the domestic electricity market is welcome.  It shows that the Government&rsquo;s policies and the regulatory framework are working.  I also welcome plans by the regulator to carry out a more fundamental review of energy tariff structures during the year in consultation with all stakeholders.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="69"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to focus on electricity pricing, because there seems to be some confusion in that regard.  The justification for the 10% reduction in the ESB domestic electricity price by the Regulator is explained by &mdash; as the Minister of State has just said &mdash; deferring distribution and network charges the ESB would be charging users.  Therefore, the Minister of State is saying the reduction in price is not linked to a reduction in the price of oil, gas and coal internationally.  I find this difficult to accept.  The Minister of State has also said we may have another gas price reduction in October, but will not see another reduction in ESB prices.</P>
        <P>Last summer, oil was at $147 a barrel and gas was significantly more expensive than it is now.  As a result, we had a 17% increase in the cost of energy at that time.  Why are we not seeing a corresponding reduction in the cost of electricity now that the raw material or fuel for generating electricity has dropped dramatically?  I understand how the energy companies work in terms of buying fuel.  They buy six months in advance or more, but six months ago energy prices had also collapsed.  Therefore, how can the Government, which is responsible for the regulator, justify the fact that no reduction in electricity bills is attached to the cost of oil, gas and coal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Last summer, the price of oil was $147 a barrel and we saw the effect of this at petrol pumps.  At that time both Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB applied for significant price increases.  The regulator decided to adopt a flexible approach and partially granted both requests and said the matter would be reviewed again in December.  We all know that between July and December the price of oil and gas reduced considerably and in December a small reduction in energy prices was announced.  These lower prices have continued.  Just a few weeks ago, the Minister asked the regulator to re-examine the situation and, as announced earlier, we will see a further reduction in prices within a few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is missing the point.  We are not seeing a reduction in the price of electricity.  I accept we are seeing an adjustment in price in domestic electricity bills, but that is only because the ESB is deferring the distribution and network charges it applies.  We are not seeing cheaper electricity being produced here as a result of the collapse in the cost of the fuel used to generate electricity.  We see a 12% reduction in the cost of gas, but why do we not see a 12% reduction in the cost of electricity production from that gas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Over 50% of the electricity generated in Ireland is generated from gas.  As we discussed earlier, in trying to bring competition into the market, we had to provide certainty on pricing to new entrants.  As a result, it is possible that some customers will see a reduction of up to 24% within a few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Not ESB customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I can put the question another way.  The situation is puzzling.  The reason there has been a drop of 10% in electricity prices is because of the deferral of charges.  The Minister of State said in his response that there would not be a further reduction in October.  Where then do we get the benefit of the reduction in oil prices?  Gas prices are tied in with oil prices and there has been a significant drop in oil prices, as can be seen at the petrol pumps.  We were told before that the reason we did not see a corresponding drop in electricity prices was because of the way energy operators acquire their oil and gas.  This is no longer sustainable because we have long passed the six-month period.  When will we see the benefit of the drop in oil prices in electricity bills?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="70"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We are already seeing the benefits of the reduction in prices.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulator stated that current prices must be set at levels that are cost reflective.  It indicated that if any suppliers are in a position to provide electricity or gas at a lower cost, it will permit them to reduce prices further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Not the ESB.  It is the largest producer, but it cannot reduce its price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It can.  The regulator has shown, in the way it has dealt with recent requests for price increases and with the reduction of world prices for gas and oil, that it is very flexible in its approach.  We have seen a number of price reductions over recent months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The most recent increase was over 17%.  We are now getting a 10% reduction, but that does not bring us back to where we were.  The Minister clearly does not know the answer to the question, but will he ask the regulator for the information as to when we will see the effect of the drop in the cost of oil and gas in the price charged for electricity by the ESB?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of factors &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In an effort to lower electricity prices in the commercial sector also, will the Government seek to have distribution and network charges in the industrial sector deferred in an effort to give the economy a competitiveness injection to reduce prices, if this is not already happening?  The Minister of State says it is but I suspect it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy referred to the cost of energy in Ireland by comparison with Manchester or many other countries.  We are very conscious of the competitiveness difficulties and the action required to deal with these.  As an island nation importing over 90% of our energy, we are obviously in a very vulnerable position.  This is why our energy policy indicates we must place great emphasis on alternative energy sources.  Renewable energy, in particular, must be developed.  Wind and ocean energy have been prioritised and we are investing in them because we regard the growth in renewables as essential to securing competitiveness and to meeting at least some of our energy needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will know the ESB does not have a majority stake in the industrial-commercial sector.  There is free competition and, as is correct, the ESB&rsquo;s market share in this area has fallen because of competition.  There is now competition in the domestic electricity supply market.  I am concerned about the ESB&rsquo;s future in terms of power generation because the Government, through regulation, is deliberately preventing the ESB from competing in the domestic sector.  Does the Minister of State not agree that, in the industrial sector, the role of the ESB, with the exception of ESB International, which is a separate company, has already been diminished and that we are now facilitating the collapse of market share in the domestic sector also by preventing the ESB from competing in terms of price with Bord G&aacute;is and Airtricity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the wish of all Members that competition be introduced to the market.  To achieve this, it was necessary to make some changes with regard to the ESB, which had a monopoly for longer than people would have desired.  To make the market attractive to new entrants, it was essential to provide certain guarantees for them such that it would be viable for them to enter the market.  It was essential to regulate prices but I admit it causes certain difficulties for the ESB.  However, these difficulties are very much in the short term.  They will obtain until the market develops and competition becomes stronger, at which time regulation will no longer be required and all companies will be on a level playing field.</P>

      <sTitle>Taxi Regulations.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this issue.  The taxi regulator produced the review of the taxi and hackney market during the week and she did not recommend a moratorium on taxi numbers.  I want to determine the progress that can be made on this matter.  The review indicates the hackney and taxi market was responsible for approximately 100 million trips nationwide in 2008 and that the industry is worth approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  At present, 77% of cabs are taxis and 23% are hackneys.  In 2005, 72% were taxis and 28% were hackneys.  Therefore, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of taxis by comparison with hackneys.</P>
        <P>The report concluded that the number of hours worked per week were above the standard number and amounted to 52, on average.  However, some taxi drivers had a second job or were working part-time.  Those with a second job were working an average of 75 hours per week, which raises certain issues pertaining to safety.  Approximately 30% of drivers were discovered to have a second job or to be working part-time.  This is a very substantial proportion.  More than 16% had a second job and some 69 million working hours were clocked up in total.  These statistics demonstrate it is a very substantial industry, worth &euro;1.5 billion or &euro;1.6 billion.  At the end of 2008, 13,000 cab drivers were working in Dublin.  Of all cab drivers in the country, 59% are operating in Dublin.  This represents a significant increase.</P>
        <P>The regulator indicates she understands circumstances have deteriorated and that taxi drivers are working significantly longer hours to make the same amount of money that they used to make.  She recognised this is a serious issue and that certain drivers are working much longer than what would be regarded as normal.  However, she does not recommend any step to deal with this, other than to try to improve the standards in the industry.  There is no recommendation on a moratorium.  I ask that we at least have a temporary one so we can take stock and have a better review and analysis of what has been happening in recent years.  The Minister of State well knows that if one comes to Dublin any night of the week one will see the streets chock-a-block with taxis.  It has transformed dramatically in recent years.  In the past, we had far too few taxis but that was back in the 1990s.  Now, it seems to be increasingly difficult for taxi drivers to make a decent living.  They must work extravagant hours with all this means for safety in the workplace.</P>
        <P>At present one can dispose of a taxi plate privately.  It would be more appropriate for it to be sold back to the local authority from which it was obtained.  In this way, we could know to a much better degree what plates are out there and the standards to which a taxi plate operates.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy stated and as the House is aware, last Monday the Commission for Taxi Regulation published an economic review into the small public service vehicles sector.  This comprehensive review contains a wide range of detailed data regarding the demand for and the supply of taxi, hackney and limousine services.  The review of the period until the end of last year demonstrates there has been a large increase in the demand for these services with, as Deputy Costello stated, <Col N="73"/>approximately 100 million trips last year.  This is an increase of more than 25% in a three year period.  This reflects the great improvements in the service available in terms of waiting times and quality.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that there was a time when, on a busy night, one could be waiting for a taxi for an hour or two and we might have been discussing such matters in another forum.  There has been an increase in supply and, as the review acknowledges, taxi drivers are operating in a more competitive market than ever.  As a result of the increased supply of vehicles, and as the review acknowledges, drivers are working longer hours than in 2005, with which many comparisons are made, and average earnings have dropped slightly despite an 8% increase on maximum fares in 2008.</P>
        <P>However, I understand the number of applications for new licences has been decreasing on a monthly basis over the past nine months.  This is probably one of the factors that has been taken into account.  People seem to realise the market has reached saturation level and there are not the same number of people wishing to enter.  The Commission for Taxi Regulation will consult widely with the sector and the public at large on the review.</P>
        <P>It is important, as the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, advised the representatives of the taxi sector when he met them on Tuesday, that all involved now give adequate time to reflect fully on all aspects of the review, its findings and recommendations and not pick or choose one or two headline recommendations from it, and convey their views to the commission.  The commission will also be seeking the views of the Taxi Advisory Council before any final determinations are made by the commission.</P>
        <P>The review states that a moratorium is not warranted on the basis that the current regulatory model is the most appropriate and has been successful in raising the quantity and quality of services.  The review also concludes that the fact drivers&rsquo; income has fallen in real terms or that they are working longer hours is insufficient to justify the introduction of a moratorium.</P>
        <P>The Taxi Regulation Act 2003, which provides the legislative basis for the licensing and operation of small public service vehicles generally, does not provide a basis for the application of quantitative controls on the issue of licences for any such vehicles.  We all recall that a High Court judgment of 2000 determined that limitation of taxi licences in the interests of existing licence holders could not be sustained.  The Minister has indicated he will consider all aspects of the report, the Oireachtas Committee on Transport report, the views of the official representatives of the taxi industry, consumers and consumer interest groups.  Anyone who has a view on the matter should make a submission to be considered as part of the next phase.</P>

      <sTitle>Social Welfare Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Deputy Ulick Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and for allowing me to discuss it with the Minister of State.  I call on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to alleviate the serious difficulties within the Department which delay the provision of services to applicants who have lost their jobs in the Gort area.  The mission statement of the Department of Social and Family Affairs states,&ldquo;Our mission is to promote a caring society through ensuring access to income support and other services, enabling active participation, promoting social inclusion and supporting families&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that the Department has failed miserably to provide and deliver on its mission statement in Gort.  As of 5 March, the average waiting time in Gort for the processing of various social welfare applications is ten and a half weeks.  I was approached for support by a carer in desperation who applied to the Department in September 2008.  Last week, I asked <Col N="74"/>the Department when it was likely the person, who has cared for an elderly person since last September, will receive the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  I was told the file is with the inspector.</P>
        <P>Everybody realises that all people delivering services at the coalface are overwhelmed with volumes of applications.  Many areas throughout the country received additional permanent or temporary staff to alleviate the backlog in these instances.  In the case of Gort, this has not happened and is not likely to happen unless the Minister intervenes.</P>
        <P>It is unfair that any person would have to wait since September 2008 until now to be told the file is still with the inspector.  It is outrageous and it shows a lack of care that the Department or Minister will not intervene in this instance.  As we speak, more than 1,200 people are on the live register in Gort.  The conditions under which officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs must work are poor.  We have no back up services where this happens, particularly with regard to applications for means tested allowances such as carer&rsquo;s allowance and non-contributory old age pensions.  These people receive the blunt end of the wedge.  It is an uncaring society that allows this to happen and to continue.</P>
        <P>We have an urgent need for follow-up support.  The social welfare office in Gort is not accessible to the public.  It is closed because the inspector cannot deal with the volume of applications and provide a service.  The telephone there cannot even be answered.  While this is so we will have an increasing backlog and difficulties for many people which is unfair to them.  It is putting pressure on the supplementary welfare system, where other agencies must intervene and provide assistance to those people.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I know that the situation is similar across the country, but it is worse in Gort than anywhere else.  If anybody has had to wait since September 2008 until now only to be told that the inspector has the file but has not dealt with it, then how can we say that we are caring for elderly people?  If not for the goodwill of the carer who has worked in the intervening period without having received the carer&rsquo;s allowance, that person would have had to be hospitalised at a greater cost.  There is a need for the Minister to provide additional backup services on a temporary or permanent basis to alleviate the problems and to provide access for the applicants to receive their entitlements.</P>

	<P>I am taking this matter on the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>There has been a very significant increase in the number of people applying for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment during the past year.  From February 2008 to February 2009, the live register increased by about 165,000 people, or over 87%.  Staff in social welfare local offices are working extremely hard and productivity increased by 74% between the last quarter of 2007 and the final quarter of 2008. The Department delivers a front line service through a network of 62 local offices and 62 branch offices, and the service in Gort is delivered from a branch office.  Branch offices are operated by private individuals on a contract for service basis.  Under the terms of their contract, branch managers are required to ensure that staffing levels are adequate to allow for the efficient performance of the work of the office.</P>
        <P>The main services provided from Gort branch office include jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, one parent family payment and an information service.  All decisions on branch office claims are made in the parent local office, which in the case of Gort is the Ennis local office. There was a staffing issue in Gort recently which impacted on the processing times for jobseeker allowance claims.  The issue is now resolved and additional inspector resources have been assigned to the area to deal with any backlog in means claim processing.</P><Col N="75"/>
        <P>Following a number of staffing reviews, the Department has assigned extra staff to local offices to deal with the increase in the live register.  More than 240 extra posts have been allocated to local offices in recent months, including an additional four staff assigned to the Ennis local office.  A range of process improvement initiatives is also being introduced.  The current average processing times in the Gort office are 2.6 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claims and 10.6 weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims.  This compares with the February national average of three weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and six weeks for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims.  The additional resources assigned to the Ennis office and the inspectorate area dealing with Gort will reduce the processing times over the coming months.</P>
        <P>It is fully appreciated that people need to get access to financial and other supports as quickly as possible.  While every effort is made to ensure that applications are processed as quickly as possible, anyone under financial pressure awaiting a decision on his or her claim for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment can apply for the supplementary welfare allowance, which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A Cheann Comhairle, I am pleased that you are presiding over this debate, because I may have to call on you for clarification before I am finished.  I have been raising this issue for many years.  I came across a parliamentary question only this morning that I tabled on 21 February 2001, when the then Minister for Education and Science stated that it was his intention to make a decision on how to address the future primary and post-primary requirements at Portlaoise &ldquo;as early as possible&rdquo;.  There has been much water under many bridges since then.</P>

        <P>In June 2008, I secured a special Adjournment debate on the matter.  I informed the Minister that the school accommodation issue in Portlaoise had become a fiasco.  I told him that Scoil Bhr&iacute;d in Knockmay was beginning to resemble a prefab shanty town.  The parents of almost 100 children had informed me that they had no school place for their children the following September.  I asked the Minister to visit Portlaoise with his officials and see the crisis for themselves.  That did not happen.  The Minister stated that approval in principle had been given for three large-scale primary building projects in Portlaoise, which will improve conditions for the schools concerned and provide much needed extra school places.</P>
        <P>I am not sure if the Minister of State was watching &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; earlier this week.  If he was, he would have been embarrassed to see himself parroting the exact same statement that his senior Minister had given me some months prior to that.  I am tired of this set piece, word-processed answer from officials, who hand them on to Ministers who then come in here to parrot out the same drivel about Portlaoise.  It does not address the problem and it does not realise the extent of the difficulties.</P>
        <P>There are three school projects to be undertaken as a matter of urgency.  The Minister told me that progress on these proposed works is being considered on an ongoing basis.  A parliamentary question in my name on 4 March 2009 revealed that the Minister has no idea how many prefabs are on site in Laois schools.  In fact, he misled the House.  Rath national school is listed as having one prefab, but it has three.  The Heath national school is listed as having three prefabs, but it has five.  Scoil Bhr&iacute;d in Knockmay, Portlaoise was listed as having seven prefabs, but it has 24, nine of which are rented.  If parliamentary questions are going to be treated in such a cavalier manner by the Department of Education and Science, then this <Col N="76"/>House is in need of reform.  Ministers can come in here and not give a damn about the nature of their replies to lawfully elected Deputies.</P>
        <P>The reply last week stated that the average cost of renting the 58 prefabs in Laois of which the Department is aware works out at &euro;13,835 per prefab per year, which totals &euro;802,000.  However, this is wrong because the cost of renting prefabs in Rath national school is &euro;15,600 per prefab per year.  I got a response from the Minister stating &ldquo;now that the accommodation requirements of the town at post-primary level are well on their way to being addressed, it is proposed to deal with the primary school requirements&rdquo;.  I have no doubt I will get the same line tonight.  This line was contained in official replies on 12 February and 4 June 2008.</P>
        <P>In the school at Knockmay, 75% of the 600 pupils are in prefabs.  The nine rented prefabs are costing &euro;125,000 per annum, or &euro;10,000 per month.  Rath national school has doubled in size since 2000, and one child in three is being taught in a prefab.  In order to address the issue, the parish priest of Portlaoise put forward an imaginative and innovative proposal that was shot down by the Department.  The parish agreed to take out a bank loan to finance the new schools and allow the Government repay the loan over a period of 15 years, but that was turned down by the Department.</P>
        <P>Deputies in this House cannot even get accurate replies from the Minister for Education and Science on the numbers and cost of prefabs and the number of children being taught in prefabs.  This is a town that has experienced rapid growth in the years of the Celtic tiger, yet no school provision has been made for these children.  It was a fiasco a year ago, but it is now a very grave problem.  I hope that the Minister of State will address this issue and not give me the same response that he and his predecessors have been giving me in this House since February 2001.  Nobody in the Department is in control.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss with the Ceann Comhairle how the record is to be set straight and how the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, can give information to the House which is highly inaccurate, wholly unsatisfactory and at variance with the facts.</P>

	<P>In any event, I will take the Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the current position for County Laois.</P>
        <P>The allocation of funding for school buildings in 2009 is in excess of &euro;650 million.  This represents a significant investment in the schools building and modernisation programme.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>At primary level in County Laois, work is progressing on-site to provide a new eight classroom school in Emo.  Another project in Borris-in-Ossary to provide a new eight-classroom school has gone to tender.  For Portlaoise, enrolments in the six primary schools in the area <Col N="77"/>have increased from 1,474 in 1999 and 2000 to 2,044 this year, a 38% increase in a relatively short period of time.  The Department has identified the town as a rapidly developing area, which attracts the highest priority in the allocation of capital funding.  In addressing the impending needs of Portlaoise, the Department met with the principals of the primary schools concerned on a number of occasions and proposed the construction of an eight-classroom school, located on a site owned by County Laois VEC, Vocational Education Committee, to cater for the increased enrolments.  The schools refused to move into this state-of-the-art facility and subsequently the building was occupied by Gaelscoil Portlaoise which had been renting temporary accommodation.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>In the interim, sufficient temporary accommodation was provided, at the request of the schools, on the convent site to meet the needs of Portlaoise for the 2008 to 2009 and the 2009 to 2010 school years.</P>

The new facilities will be configured as a junior and senior school and will cater for some 1,600 pupils.  The parish proposes acquiring the site for these new permanent schools.  However, this site is currently not accessible or serviced.  The Department has serious concerns regarding the landlocked site and has sought clarification from the patron on a number of issues, by letter dated 13 February.  The Department is awaiting a reply.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Department would have to be satisfied, especially in the current climate, that it would not be exposed to frontloading services such as roads, water, drainage, electricity, etc., at great cost to the State for a private development, to facilitate construction of the school.</P>

	<P>Furthermore, on 12 February this year, the Minister announced 25 projects which were to enter into architectural design.  This announcement included a major capital project for the extension of Scoil Bride, Knockmay, to create a 32-classroom school catering for 800 pupils.</P>
        <P>Apart from provision at primary level, significant investment has been made in provision at post-primary level.  The Department has recently delivered Portlaoise college, a new VEC school catering for 700 pupils.  It is situated on a 20 acre site and has 50 classrooms including science laboratories, four computer rooms, a home economics room and a music and drama room.  A new community school for Mountrath is currently in construction.  This new school will provide places for 650 pupils and it is envisaged that it will be ready for occupation by September 2009.  Two other post-primary school building projects are due to go on site this <Col N="78"/>year and are being delivered by way of public private partnerships.  Both of these schools will cater for 850 pupils each.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will understand that it is not possible to progress all projects at the same time.  However, I assure him that the Minister is committed to continuing to invest in school accommodation in County Laois.  I am confident that the measures outlined will assist in alleviating the immediate demand for pupil places in the area and I thank the Deputy for allowing me the opportunity to outline the Department&rsquo;s position on school provision in the Laois area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, is in the Chamber and I note the point he made concerning the frailties of the Adjournment debate processes.  However, I raise this issue today with great desperation.  I have come to the House on other occasions to raise serious issues concerning schools building programmes.  Only two weeks ago, the Ceann Comhairle allowed me to raise an issue with regard to the building programme of the Holy Rosary national school in Ballycragh.  This is a completely different situation.  This concerns a job, granted to the community, but which has not been satisfactorily completed.  I realise the Minister of State has come to the House with a prepared response, which is fair enough.  However, I express to him my complete frustration as far as this issue is concerned.</P>

        <P>Ard Mhuire national school in Belgard, Tallaght, was opened in 1977 by the then Minister for Education, Mr. John Wilson.  It has provided an excellent educational service to the local community in my parish over the years.  Currently, it has an enrolment of 298 pupils under a very progressive principal, Mr. Pat Keogh, and an excellent board.  We have been able to deliver real progress for the school in recent times.</P>
        <P>Time has moved on since the school opened and the school building has aged.  Some &euro;1 million was spent on a new roof, which was a tremendous project.  The current project, which is the subject of my matter today, cost &euro;3.2 million.  That represents excellent progress for my local school and I welcome it.  However, the project has not worked.  It was to redesign the school, providing it with a modern upgrade and catering for a new intake.  The main construction company was Midland Construction.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue with the Department several times last Autumn.  In October last year, the Department, at the level of assistant secretary, acknowledged there were difficulties between the school and the contractor.  At that stage, the Department pointed out that while the school board was refusing to pay moneys to the contractor on foot of certificates issues by the consulting architects, because it believed that there was a breach of contract, it impressed upon the school board the need to honour the contract.  I believe the school has acted in good faith.  It came to an agreement through negotiation in November following a meeting with the senior architect and other parties.  An agreed list was to be implemented, including the insulation in the ceilings, shelving in the library, a sink unit in the remedial room in block C, the repair of noticeboards, concrete steps to the boiler house, double-flush unit toilets, the lowering of the hatch to the entrance, blinds and several other issues on a very extensive snag list.</P>
        <P>I understand the board held an emergency meeting this week and is very unhappy, angered and frustrated with the current situation.  The board is now informing the local Deputies for the area, on behalf of whom I represent the matter today, that it wishes the work to be completed to the satisfaction of the school community.  It demands this work is done now by a new contractor.  There is no question that we should be supportive of the board of Ard Mhuire School to ensure that all essential works are now completed, taking into account health and safety consider<Col N="79"/>ations.  I call on the Minister to ensure this takes place.  The Minister will probably inform me that departmental officials are working with the school authorities.  While I do not deny this is the case, completion of this project could be a good news story in a parish in my constituency.  However, the board of the school has been messed about and does not know where to turn.  I appeal to the Minister of State to bring this matter to the attention of his senior colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  The Minister should assign to a senior official the task of finding out the reason the response to the school, which has acted properly, has not been satisfactory.</P>
        <P>I am depending on the Minister of State to take an interest in this important issue.  State money has been expended on this matter.  The Scoil Ard Mhuire community was pleased with the many announcements made on its building project but now requires effective action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Connor for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity of outlining to the House the Department&rsquo;s position regarding the building project for Scoil Ard Mhuire, Belgard, Tallaght.</P>
        <P>As part of the multi-annual school building programme, the Government has invested heavily in the modernisation of school facilities throughout the country in recent years.  More than &euro;2.6 billion was provided for school building infrastructure between 2000 and 2006 under the last national development plan and a further &euro;4.5 billion is being invested under the current National Development Plan 2007-2013, of which &euro;653 million is being provided this year alone.</P>
        <P>In the period from 2002 to date, in the region of 650 large-scale building projects at primary and post-primary schools were given approval to proceed to tender and construction.  Close to 500 of these projects have reached practical completion.  In addition to the large-scale projects thousands of smaller projects were funded in this period under programmes such as the small schools scheme, permanent accommodation scheme and summer works scheme.</P>
        <P>In view of the large amount of activity under the school building and modernisation programme, it was prudent to improve efficiency and ensure value for money.  In this regard a number of innovations have been introduced in recent years, such as fixed price contracts, delivery of small-scale projects on a devolved basis, the development of generic repeat design buildings and the use of design and build contracts to deliver very large schools building projects.  With regard to major projects the Department&rsquo;s role is concentrated in setting the initial design parameters.  Initial designs are evaluated at meetings rather than through correspondence to speed up the design phase.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that there has been a substantial increase in the demand for additional accommodation in existing schools and for the provision of complete new school buildings in developing areas in recent years.  This results from a rapidly increasing school population and the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  At the same time, the Department has been significantly improving and modernising the condition of existing school buildings to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools.  It was in this context that funding for the upgrading of the Scoil Ard Mhuire school building was approved.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in recent years the Department has introduced a number of devolved grant schemes.  A key principle behind the devolution of these schemes is that responsibility for the management of the project is devolved to the school authority.  The school authority can then make use of its local knowledge and presence on the ground to manage the project more effectively and ensure better value for money for the taxpayer.</P><Col N="80"/>
        <P>The Department funds the work on receipt of the necessary certification from the school&rsquo;s architect that the work has been completed to a satisfactory standard.  However, the contract for the works in such cases is between the school authorities and the builder.  In the case of Scoil Ard Mhuire, the Department became aware of some difficulties with the project when it was nearing completion.  Since then, officials from the Department have met the school management and have been in ongoing contact with the parties with the express aim of having the project completed satisfactorily and at best value to the taxpayer.  Department officials will continue to work with the school authority with a view to ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the current situation and the completion of the project.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House and assure him of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to seeing the satisfactory conclusion of this project in a way that provides value for money for the taxpayer.  I note the contents of the Deputy&rsquo;s contribution and will ensure the issues he has articulated will be brought to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 31 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the Ard Fheis motion to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>While the Minister has no direct role in the operational planning and construction of the transmission system infrastructure, the Government&rsquo;s policy objective is to ensure that energy is consistently available with minimal risk of supply disruption to meet the needs of businesses and domestic consumers.  It is EirGrid&rsquo;s role, as the national transmission system operator, to develop and upgrade the transmission system in order to meet ongoing and future electricity needs.</P>
        <P>As part of EirGrid&rsquo;s pre-planning consultations and overall project development, EirGrid and Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) have jointly published a report on undergrounding issues specific to the proposed Meath Cavan and Cavan Tyrone transmission projects. The report by PB Power consultants notes that:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Overhead lines comprise over 98% of Europe&rsquo;s onshore electricity network.  This trend is not expected to change in the foreseeable future;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />For overhead transmission lines, temporary faults are generally caused by poor weather and can be remedied within less than a second.  Persistent faults are rare and can usually <Col N="82"/>be remedied in a matter of hours. For underground cables, a fault would invariably be persistent and average repair times would be a number of weeks.  The introduction of significant quantities of underground cable, in strategically important circuits may therefore compromise system security;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Underground cables on the Meath Cavan and Cavan Tyrone routes would be over seven times more costly than overhead lines, costing &euro;588m versus &euro;81m for overhead lines. The operating costs would be &euro;73m over the lifetime of the projects, versus &euro;44m for overhead lines;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />There are differing environmental impacts from both overhead lines and underground cables.  Impacts can be mitigated by good route selection, design and construction management;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Electromagnetic Fields from either overhead lines or underground cables would all be lower than European and International guideline limits.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The PB Power report arrives at similar conclusions to the Independent Study on Overhead Electricity Transmission Lines versus Underground Cables, which was commissioned by the Department in 2008.  This independent Study, undertaken by international consultants, Ecofys, concluded that:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The &ldquo;forced outage rates&rdquo; for underground transmission cables constitute a &ldquo;severe limitation&rdquo; for underground cables.  Underground cables do not compare favourably to overhead lines in terms of adequacy of the electricity transmission system and reliability of electricity supply.  The consultants state this finding as &ldquo;the dominating criterion&rdquo; when comparing overhead and underground technologies;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The capital costs of underground cables could be at least five times the cost of overhead lines;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Magnetic fields directly under transmission lines are generally as low as 10&ndash;20% of the maximum levels recommended in the World Health Organisation guidelines.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This Ecofys Study is generic rather than site-specific, while the PB Power report relates specifically to the Meath Cavan and Cavan Tyrone projects.</P>
        <P>EirGrid has made clear that consultations will continue with stakeholders over the coming months, as work continues on preparing a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the Statutory Planning Authority in relation to all strategic infrastructure projects. As part of its application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, EirGrid will be submitting a full Environmental Impact Statement and a range of reports on its consultation process, including the PB Power report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been some debate around whether customers would be best <Col N="83"/>served by functional opening of the network or by a structural split between the retail and network divisions of the business. </P>
        <P>Functional or operational separation involves establishing separate network infrastructure and services divisions within a company to give competing providers access to the infrastructure on equivalent terms, while structural separation can mean the complete separation of these parts into separate corporate entities.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has no direct role in relation to any form of restructuring of eircom or in relation to Local Loop unbundling, the promotion and regulation of which is a matter for the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  ComReg is statutorily independent in the exercise of its functions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Eircom is a private company which must implement the corporate structure that best meets its commercial needs and regulatory requirements.  In this context appropriate engagement must take place with ComReg on any regulatory issues that might arise in a functionally or structurally separated company.</P>
        <P>Given the key position of eircom in the overall Irish telecommunications industry, the performance of the company is important in terms of overall Government policy objectives in this area.  In particular, the roll out of high quality, competitive broadband infrastructure is a key priority for Government and as eircom operates an extensive network, their investment and organisational plans are of importance in this regard.</P>
        <P>The key issue for the Minister is the implementation of an operational model that provides the optimum competitive environment and promotes investment and innovation in the development of telecoms networks.  This will in turn facilitate the widespread introduction of new digital devices and applications.</P>
        <P>More generally, the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for reform of the legislative framework for the electronic communications sector include adding functional separation to the remedy tool box of national regulators.  Such a remedy would only be used where there is clear evidence that the usual remedies have been tried and failed.  This proposal has been supported by Ireland as effective remedies are key to realising the benefits of a competitive market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 14, 38 and 210 together.</P>
        <P>On 8 February, together with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister launched the Home Energy Saving Scheme, one of three priority home insulation schemes in the Government&rsquo;s National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery.</P>
        <P>The Home Energy Saving Scheme has an allocation of &euro;50 million for 2009.  The scheme provides grant assistance to homeowners for attic and wall insulation, efficient boilers and heating controls.  Grant rates average 30% of the cost of works, although these rates vary depending on the measure concerned.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) advised on the measures for inclusion in the scheme and they will also administer the scheme.  SEI has built up a considerable expertise on residential energy efficiency matters and oversaw the pilot phase of the scheme last year.</P>
        <P>The selected measures are deemed to be those most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners at the least cost.  There are other measures, such as windows, which are not currently included in the scheme.  These may also improve the energy performance of a home but may not be as cost effective for the homeowner.  The Department and SEI will be keeping the scheme under review.  If there is a strong cost-benefit case for adding other measures to the scheme, it will be given every consideration.</P>
        <P>Homeowners will be able to formally apply under the Scheme from later this month.  In the meantime, they can register their interest with SEI.  Homeowners may also arrange to have a Building Energy Rating (BER) assessment carried out immediately.  While a grant of &euro;200 is available for this, it is not a requirement for participation in the Home Energy Saving Scheme.</P>
        <P>While homeowners can of course proceed with the BER assessment now, they should not undertake any remedial works until they have received formal grant approval from SEI.  Work underway or completed will not be eligible for grant assistance.</P>
        <P>Prior to opening the scheme to householder applications, SEI is registering installers and contractors intending to carry out insulation and other works under the scheme.  Householders will be obliged to identify their chosen contractor in their application and all such contractors must be registered with SEI.  The registration scheme is essential to ensure the quality of work and is in the interest of homeowners and the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Contractors registering with SEI for the scheme are required to sign up to a code of conduct and to comply with a range of terms and conditions to ensure work quality standards.  They will need to demonstrate that they are suitably qualified to carry out the works for which they are seeking registration.  Contractors will also have to carry a specified level of insurance and be fully tax compliant.</P>
        <P>As of 6 March, over one thousand contractors had applied to SEI to register for the Scheme.  The list of registered contractors will be continually updated by SEI.</P>
        <P>There has been an excellent level of interest in the scheme to date.  As of 2 March, SEI had taken over 13,000 phone queries from homeowners and over 40,000 people had visited SEI&rsquo;s website to check out the scheme.  The Minister and I are optimistic that there will be very strong take-up of the scheme, with resultant good outcomes for homeowners, for the construction sector, for the environment and for the economy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 51 and 56 together.</P>
        <P>The Minister is satisfied that the various incentives now in place to support microgeneration investment will attract sufficient market interest and ensure the roll-out of microgeneration projects.</P>
        <P>Net-metering specifically enables the development of small scale renewable energy projects by domestic customers.  It allows the export of electricity back to the grid, reversing the electricity meter and offsetting electricity previously bought by the customer.  The standard electricity meter installed by ESB Networks does not operate in reverse and cannot therefore support a net-metering programme.  Customers investing in microscale projects will require net, or two-way, metering to be installed by ESB Networks at no additional charge.</P>
        <P>The recently announced guaranteed price for electricity exported back to the grid is a significant incentive for potential investors in domestic microgeneration.</P>
        <P>It is the case that the commercial interest of electricity suppliers is in purchasing power from larger scale renewable energy projects producing electricity in commercial quantities.  The REFIT support Scheme, which is administered by the Department, provides fixed prices for electricity produced from renewable energy powered plants.  The generators must source and contract with one of the electricity suppliers to purchase their power.  The suppliers, in turn, are compensated at pre-set fixed levels for the additional costs they incur in purchasing and trading the electricity.</P>
        <P>Micro-scale projects given their small size require a different solution.  The new microgeneration programme, operated by ESB Networks and supported by ESB Customer Supply, will facilitate up to 4,000 domestic customers investing in micro-scale projects by providing a guaranteed price of 19 cent per kilowatt hour for electricity exported to the grid.</P>
        <P>SEI&rsquo;s Micro-generation Pilot Programme includes support for between 50 and 60 microgeneration installations to develop technical solutions.  The research and field trials will address technical issues including grid connection and standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.</P>

	<P>The objective of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is to provide access to affordable scaleable broadband services to rural areas, many of which do not currently have any broadband service.</P>
        <P>The NBS is therefore a scheme designed to provide quality but basic broadband services for those areas which do not currently have access to broadband. Whilst it is scalable in nature it was not envisaged as a platform for the rollout of high speed next generation broadband networks in rural areas. The key policy objective which the NBS addresses is the provision of broadband where it is not available.</P>
        <P>The Department has entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  The Department is satisfied that the network 3 will roll out in the NBS area has been designed to provide a quality of service to meet the broadband needs of customers in the NBS area.  The quality of the network will be monitored by my Department for the duration of the contract and upgrades of the network and network equipment are automatically triggered when contractually agreed levels of traffic are exceeded. These levels are set to ensure that the network is upgraded before traffic levels reach a level where quality degrades.</P>
        <P>The mobile broadband service will be delivered using Internet High Speed Packet Access (I-HSPA) technology and will cover up to 95% of the NBS coverage area.  The service will have a minimum download speed of 1.2 Megabits per second, a maximum contention ratio of 36:1, a latency of 120 milliseconds and a 15 gigabyte (12 down, 3 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit. Additionally, the service will have a minimum upload speed of 200 kilobits per second.  The 200 kilobits per second product is the minimum speed available and is comparable to what is typically used by residential broadband users in urban areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the NBS contract the broadband products will be upgraded to higher specifications (speeds, contention and data caps) in July 2010 and again in October 2012 without any increase in the monthly recurring charge.  NBS subscribers will experience minimum download speeds of 1.6 megabits per second and 2.3 megabits per second and minimum upload speeds of 1.2 megabits per second and 1.4 megabits per second subsequent to these upgrades in 2010 and 2012 respectively.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the fact that some areas will be very difficult to reach using standard infrastructure, 3 will make available a satellite product which is expected to cover around 5% of the NBS areas.  The satellite product will have a minimum download speed of 1 megabit per second, a minimum upload speed of 128 kilobits per second, a maximum contention ratio of 48:1, latency of 800 milliseconds and an 11 gigabyte (10 down, 1 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the NBS will provide speeds comparable with products available in the market for urban areas and greatly assist in bridging the digital divide.</P>

	<P>The Fuel Poverty Action Research Project was established by Combat Poverty and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) to inform the future directions of energy efficiency programmes for vulnerable customers.  The project involved a rigorous assessment of the energy, environmental, thermal comfort and health benefits of the Warmer Homes Scheme. The report of the Fuel Poverty Research Project is due to be published at the end of this month following a presentation to the Interdepartmental /  Agency Energy Affordable Group.</P>
        <P>The Warmer Homes Scheme is administered by SEI.  It provides structural energy efficiency improvements to private homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty. It is delivered by community based organisations who work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations, including public health nurses, MABS and St Vincent De Paul to identify and address the energy needs of vulnerable homes.</P>
        <P>To date energy efficiency improvements in over 22,500 homes have been made under the Warmer Homes Scheme. &euro;20 million has been provided for the scheme in 2009 which includes &euro;5 million being provided between ESB and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann. This will enable structural improvements to be made to at least 15,000 homes this year.  SEI, in consultation with ESB, BG&Eacute; and other stakeholders, is also reviewing the overall operation of the scheme to ensure that maximum impact is achieved from the enhanced funding.  The report of the Fuel Poverty Research Project will clearly inform the overall review.</P>
        <P>The most recent research figures available on fuel poverty in Ireland are contained in a recent working paper by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  There are a variety of ways to measure fuel poverty including the proportion of household expenditure on fuel, the condition of the house and the subjective view of occupants about their energy needs.</P>
        <P>The ESRI estimate that using the expenditure method, over 300,000 or 19.4% of Irish households may have experienced fuel poverty in 2008. Alternatively, using the subjective method, over 68,000 or 4.6% of households reported that they could not afford to heat their homes adequately.</P>
        <P>There are many definitions and measurements of fuel poverty. The Government&rsquo;s own working definition is the inability to afford adequate warmth in a home or the inability to achieve adequate warmth because the home is not energy efficient.  By assisting vulnerable homes to become energy efficient, the Warmer Homes Scheme is designed to tackle the root causes of energy affordability.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 19 and 33 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have already advised the House, the Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes were designed as interim measures to increase the level of bio-fuels in the fuel mix, in advance of the introduction of a national bio-fuels obligation in 2010.  Market penetration of bio-fuels in Ireland has grown from virtually nil in 2004 although there is still a long way to go.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the case of some of the developments in receipt of excise relief under the Scheme, imports were acknowledged as a necessary part of their plans pending the establishment of facilities and supply chains.  It is relevant that the European bio-fuels industry has experienced difficulties with a prolonged period of price volatility, culminating in the recent fall in the price of mineral diesel.  The price of feedstocks for bio-fuels production has conversely risen.  These two factors have led to severe competitive challenges for the European and Irish bio-fuels industry.  The availability of cheap US subsidised biodiesel, known as &ldquo;B99&rdquo; has placed considerable commercial pressure on the European and Irish industry.  For these reasons, progress on constructing the facilities envisaged under the Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme has been slow despite some early successes. Together with other member states, Ireland has been pressing the EU Commission to introduce measures to counter the negative impact of the US export subsidy.  A Commission response is expected in the coming days.  Short term EU action and the introduction of the National Biofuels Obligations next year should provide the certainty needed for investors in Irish biofuels production.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Biofuels Obligation will incorporate the EU sustainability criteria negotiated last year. This will create the necessary framework to ensure that bio-fuels in Ireland are sustainably sourced. The development of second and third generation bio-fuel technologies is also key to ensuring long-term sustainability.  We will continue to work with the Commission and other member states to ensure that the sustainability criteria are transparent, effective and rigorously enforced.</P>

	<P>The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard the Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to improve broadband coverage.  These initiatives have helped to facilitate the development of the market to the point where over 60% of Irish households now have a broadband connection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Additionally, ComReg&rsquo;s quarterly report for Q3 2008, states that 61.1% of those households have a connection in the speed category of 2Mbps &mdash; 10Mbps.  Furthermore, at the end of Q1 2008, 83% of Irish SMEs had a broadband connection.  Most of those SMEs, 72.6%, according to ComReg&rsquo;s report for Q3 2008, have a connection in the speed category of 2Mbps &mdash; 10Mbps.</P>
        <P>There are still some parts of the country where the private sector cannot justify the commercial provision of broadband services. Accordingly, the Department has undertaken to implement the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and has entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a <Col N="89"/>Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.  Services will begin to be rolled out in April 2009 and the entire NBS area will be served by September 2010.</P>
        <P>The broadband market in Ireland is regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  It is now a very competitive market with over 40 companies providing retail broadband services in Ireland.  This is testament to the effectiveness of the regulatory model operated by ComReg.</P>
        <P>The policy framework for future broadband development in Ireland is set out in the consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband, which the Minister published last July.  The consultation period on the paper has concluded and the final policy paper will be published shortly.  This will set out the role of the private sector in investment in next generation broadband and the role of the State in facilitating such investment.</P>

	<P>The cost of digital receivers for the Irish digital terrestrial television (DTT) market will ultimately be determined by manufacturers, retailers, RT&Eacute; and the commercial DTT operator.</P>
        <P>The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 2007 provides for the development of digital terrestrial television in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.  The Act requires RT&Eacute; to provide a free to air national digital terrestrial television system with capacity to carry RT&Eacute;, TG4 and TV3.</P>
        <P>Under the Act, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) is required to provide for commercial DTT services.  The BCI is currently negotiating a contract with Boxer DTT Limited, a consortium operated by Communicorp and Swedish company Boxer TV-Access.</P>
        <P>The cost of receivers on the Irish market will depend on a number of factors. These factors include:</P>
<P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />The receiver specification,</P>
<P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />The type of receiver and,</P>
<P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />For commercial digital terrestrial service providers the way in which their service package is bundled.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In providing for the launch of DTT services, RT&Eacute; and Boxer DTT Limited have jointly developed specifications for set top boxes for the Irish market.</P>
        <P>The agreed specifications are based on the NorDig receiver specification.  This ties the Irish market to bigger European markets.  This means that Ireland can take advantage of economies of scale provided by these larger markets and this will help reduce the cost of receivers to the consumer.</P>
        <P>In terms of digital receivers, there are three main types of digital terrestrial receivers produced.  These are:</P><Col N="90"/>
<P el="5">1. <Miles com="ix" />Set top boxes;</P>
<P el="5">2. <Miles com="ix" />Personal Video Recorders;</P>
<P el="5">3. <Miles com="ix" />Integrated Digital Television Sets.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Set top boxes are the most basic and least expensive form of receiver.  They are connected to an existing television set and convert the digital signal to analogue so that it can be viewed on the TV screen.</P>
        <P>Personal video recorders are also connected to television sets and work like a sophisticated video recorder.  They allow viewers to record, pause and delay programmes and are expected to be more expensive than a basic set top box.</P>
        <P>An integrated digital television set has the set top box receiver built into the television itself so no external device is needed to receive the digital terrestrial television service.  The cost of an integrated television is expected to be more expensive than the cost of personal video recorders and considerably more expensive than the cost of a set top box.</P>

        <P>The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 2007 provides for the development of digital terrestrial television in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.  The Act requires RT&Eacute; to provide a free to air national digital terrestrial television system with capacity to carry RT&Eacute;, TG4 and TV3.</P>
        <P>Under the Act the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) is required to provide for commercial DTT services.  The BCI is currently negotiating a contract with Boxer DTT Limited, a consortium operated by Communicorp and Swedish company Boxer TV-Access.  It is anticipated that the launch of commercial DTT services will be co-ordinated with the launch of the free to air DTT service in autumn 2009.  The free to air analogue TV services will continue in parallel with the digital services until the analogue services are switched off.</P>
        <P>Under Section 11 of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007, the Minister is tasked with providing a date for switching off the analogue services in Ireland.  In deciding on such a date the Minister must take account of, <i>inter alia</i>, the extent of rollout and the level of take up of digital services.</P>
        <P>I am cognisant of the fact that most European countries expect to switch off analogue services by 2012 and I recognise the importance of meeting this deadline if Ireland is to continue to compete at an international level in the broadcasting and broader communications markets.  The UK has a schedule to switch off analogue TV in different regions from 2008 to 2012 in favour of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT).  Wales is set to switch off its analogue television <Col N="91"/>services in autumn 2009.  This is likely to impact viewers along the South East of the country who currently receive overspill of the UK television signals.  Viewers on cable and satellite will not be affected.</P>
        <P>Both RT&Eacute; and the BCI are aware of the situation in Wales and of the importance of providing DTT along the South East of Ireland, as a matter of priority.  Depending on the DTT package available, persons who subscribe to commercial DTT services should be able to receive UK television channels currently available via analogue overspill.</P>

	<P>Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation requires the Irish authorities to <Col N="92"/>prepare a national Eel Management Plan for implementation from 1 July 2009 or from the earliest possible time before the date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The EU target is clearly defined in the Regulation where it states that the objective of each Member State&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.  In other words, the Regulation requires that 4 kg of eels escape to sea for every 10 kg that would have escaped if people did not kill any or stop any migrating, and the number of elvers coming into the water was as high as it ever was.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s level of escapement is currently estimated at only 24%.  When the last 20 years of poor recruitment is taken into account, I am advised that it is likely that the adult eel stock in Irish waters will continue to decline for at least the next decade.</P>
        <P>Given the critical status of the eel stock, as demonstrated in the assessment contained in the draft National Eel Management Plan, a number of management measures have been identified as necessary to reach the targets set in the EU Regulation, including closure of the commercial and recreational fishery from 2009.  It is also necessary to mitigate the impact of hydropower on escapement, to ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers and to improve water quality.  The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken as a conservation measure to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible, which if all measures proposed are adopted and if other EU Member States adopt a similar conservative approach, could be as long as 90 years (i.e. an average of 4 eel generations).</P>
        <P>Under the regulation, all aspects of the plan must be reviewed in 2012.  This review will consider, inter alia, whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any river basin district in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of the stocks.</P>

	<P>The rollout of the national smart meter programme is progressing in line <Col N="93"/>with the commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government.  The Smart Meter programme is a pivotal part of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to significantly enhance management of energy demand and to achieve radical improvements in energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current pilot phase of the programme is critical to informing from all perspectives the development of the programme. This is a highly complex technological project and the trials are essential to ensure that the optimum and most cost effective technology and systems are identified for implementation of the national smart meter programme.</P>
        <P>The pilot phase, for both electricity and gas, was launched in September 2008.  The results of the pilot project will inform both the timing of a national roll out, and the technologies and systems to be adopted.  The pilot phase is scheduled to be completed by end 2010.  The outcome should be fully informed conclusions on the most suitable model of smart meters/IT systems, tariffing structure, communications system which have the capability to deliver the anticipated benefits of smart metering in the specifics of the Irish energy market &mdash; notably the dispersed nature of the network reflecting settlement patterns.</P>
        <P>The pilot phase encompasses two strands.  The technology trial is testing a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure.  The technology trial involves the installation of up to 10,000 meters.  The customer behaviour trial is determining the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable permanent change in consumer behaviour.</P>
        <P>Participants for the customer behaviour trial are being selected to ensure that the sample is representative of consumers both in terms of energy usage profiles and geographical spread.  Invitations to participate in the trial are being issued on a phased basis to electricity customers with 8,000 letters of invitation issued thus far.  The number of participants needed for the electricity customer behaviour trial is 6,000.  Installation of electricity meters for this strand of the pilot phase will be completed by mid year.  As of 6 March, 2,223 meters have been installed by ESB Networks.</P>
        <P>The participation of gas customers in the pilot phase is being progressed, with the procurement process for gas smart meters now under way.  This should allow for the completion of the installation of meters for the gas element of the pilot phase before the end of 2009.  Four models of electricity smart meter are being trialled in the pilot phase. The specifications of these metering systems will allow the testing of a range of functions, including, interval metering reading, time of use tariffing and the use of In Home Display devices, which, in turn, can facilitate demand management and increased energy efficiency.  They will also provide reliable quality data on actual energy use which will inform better service to consumers through better fault monitoring and outage recording, power quality monitoring, reduced theft and losses and improved network planning.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is finalising its review of submissions from ESB Networks, ESB Customer Supply, Sustainable Energy Ireland, Bord G&aacute;is Networks and industry participants, on the budget for the entire pilot phase.  The CER advises that the cost of installing smart metering systems for the electricity module of the pilot phase is being estimated at &euro;29.9 million.  The cost of the gas module will be quantified following the procurement process currently under way.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the reconfiguration of Government Departments in 2007 resulted in the transfer of certain functions to other Departments.  In that context, my Department has significantly reduced staff numbers and consequently we now occupy considerably less office space in Dublin.  We have also vacated the Department&rsquo;s former offices in Castlebar.  As a result it is not feasible to draw comparison between energy consumption in the years 2004 &mdash; 2007 for the Department which essentially only exists in its current format since 2007.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works led initiative to make significant savings on energy across the Public Sector extends to the agencies under the remit of the Department.  However, issues relating to energy consumption and savings in the Agencies is a day to day administrative matter for the Agencies themselves and I have no function in that regard.</P>
        <P>As regards activity in the Department, we established an Energy Team in late 2007 with the aim of reducing CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from energy consumption.  The Energy Team has worked closely with the OPW and data for 2008 shows a reduction of almost 10% in consumption and 9% in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions over 2007 for the Department&rsquo;s building in Adelaide Road.  A reduction is also indicated for Tom Johnson House of some 4% in energy consumption and almost 4% in emissions.</P>

	<P>The Minister has consistently affirmed the Government&rsquo;s decision in the Energy Policy White Paper and the Programme for Government, to transfer the ownership of the electricity transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid.  It is also fundamental Government policy that the electricity and gas networks are retained as strategic national assets in State ownership which will never be privatised.</P>
        <P>The transfer of the transmission assets involves the resolution of complex technical, financial and operational issues as well as legislation.  The need for transparent and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders in the process of implementing Government policy in relation to the transfer of the electricity transmission assets have been consistently underlined by the Minister.  The Minister has announced the commissioning an independent analysis of the transmission transfer, including costs, benefits and regulatory impact assessment, set in the context also of EU developments and the all island single electricity market.</P>
        <P>Input to the process of independent analysis will accordingly be invited from the direct key stakeholders.  These are the management and unions of ESB and EirGrid, the ESB Employee Share Ownership Trust, as well as the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>All the direct stakeholders have pivotal roles to play in the process of engagement and analysis and in achieving outcomes that are best for EirGrid and ESB, which are satisfactory for all parties concerned, and which are in the best interests of the economy and consumers.</P>
        <P>The Minister will finalise the appointment of the senior independent chair of the process shortly with a view to getting the collective process of engagement and analysis under way.

        <P>East West interconnection will also give Ireland direct and secure access to the UK energy market and onwards also to the EU mainland markets.  This will increase Ireland&rsquo;s security of electricity supply and enhance the competitive energy market.  Over time the interconnector should exert downward pressure on prices in the all-island electricity market.  The Government has set the ambitious target of 40% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  The East West Interconnector will support the increased penetration of renewable generation, particularly wind generation in the Irish market.  It will offer opportunities for export of Irish wind generated electricity.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 69 together.</P>
        <P>The Minister together with the Minister for Transport, announced plans last year for the large scale deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  The target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, will represent up to 250,000 cars on Irish roads over the next 12 years.  A number of initiatives to advance the strategy have already been put in place.  The Minister for Finance has provided a new tax incentive for businesses to purchase electric vehicles in the 2009 Finance Act.  This enables businesses to write off 100% of the cost of purchase against tax under the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is also developing a &euro;1 million project on alternative transport technologies including electric vehicles.</P>
        <P>An inter-departmental agency taskforce has been established and is meeting regularly to progress the framework for deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland and is being chaired by my Department.  The Departments of Transport, Finance, the Environment, Heritage and Local <Col N="100"/>Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment along with SEI, ESB, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are all represented on the taskforce.</P>
        <P>The taskforce is assessing the options and timeframe for creating the necessary infrastructure for the national roll-out of electric vehicles.  The Government is sending out the message that Ireland is open for business in this area and we will also take account of global developments as the technologies mature.  The taskforce will report its initial findings and advise on next steps in the next few months.  Major deployment of electric vehicles will have a very positive impact in reducing our carbon emissions and our reliance on imported fossil fuels in the transport area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>In designing the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which was approved by the EU Commission, the Department needed to strike a balance between reaching as many unserved areas as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas, thereby minimising market distortion in accordance with EU State Aid rules.</P>
        <P>The NBS will be rolled out an electoral division (ED) basis and will address EDs that are without adequate broadband services.  Where an ED is completely unserved or partially covered, it will be included in the NBS.  EU State Aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas that are already substantially served by broadband.  While recognising that some premises within substantially served areas may have difficulties for a variety of reasons in receiving a broadband service, the NBS cannot cater for such limited instances as to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  Accordingly, EDs that are substantially covered by an existing broadband service provider are deemed to be served and have had to be excluded from the NBS.  It is hoped that over time, as competition increases, service providers will be attracted to offer service to unserved premises in these areas.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Alternative energy supply to the national electricity grid has increased each year in the last five years for which data is available, viz. 4.4% in 2003, 5.2 % in 2004, 6.8% in 2005, 8.6% in 2006, and 9.5% in 2007.  Estimates for 2008 show the figure to stand at around 11%.  There are approximately 1,400 megawatts of renewables connected to the grid.  In excess of 1,000MW is wind with hydro contributing approximately 238MW.  The remainder comprises biomass and biogas.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has operated a group approach to connecting projects to the national grid, which is designed to streamline the connection process in the interests of efficiency and cost effectiveness for developers.  The majority of projects in the Gate 2 group processing approach, 1,348 MW approximately, have now received grid connection offers.</P>
        <P>The Gate 3 process was recently the subject of a public consultation by the CER and it proposes to process a further 3,900MW for network connection.  In November last year EirGrid published its GRID25 plan, which sets out the overall strategy for development of the transmission system in support of renewable energy and the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully supportive of all developments at EU level to protect the rights of energy consumers. In that context Ireland welcomed in 2007 the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the adoption of a non-binding European Charter on the Rights of Energy Consumers.</P>
        <P>Negotiations are currently underway between the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament on finalisation of the Third Energy Package aimed at further liberalising EU energy markets. A key element of these negotiations, which I very much welcome, includes proposals from the Parliament to significantly enhance the rights of European energy consumers, which reflects the concepts in the European Commission&rsquo;s own proposed Charter.</P>
        <P>Member States are required under the European Commission&rsquo;s European Energy Consumer Checklist, to publish specific information for consumers on electricity and gas markets.  In accordance with these requirements, on 6th February last, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has published Ireland&rsquo;s Consumer Checklist. This is available on the CER&rsquo;s consumer website, www.energycustomers.ie and provides comprehensive information for Irish energy users on their rights and entitlements. The CER also has a dedicated customer team &mdash; www.energycustomers.ie &mdash; providing information on all aspects of customer protection in the energy sector. The team carries out the CER&rsquo;s statutory function to provide a complaints resolution service to energy customers and has the power to direct suppliers and network operators to award compensation or to resolve the complaint appropriately if the complaint is upheld.</P>
        <P>In addition to providing a complaint resolution service, the CER requires energy suppliers, through their licenses, to put in place codes of practice and customer charters guaranteeing a minimum level of service for all customers.  Requirements include the publication of codes of practice covering marketing practices, billing, payment and disconnection practices, complaints handling and the provision of services to customers with special needs. In addition to these codes of practice, suppliers serving domestic or SME customers must publish a customer charter setting out service guarantees with financial penalties to be paid if these guarantees are not met.   Suppliers must publish and publicise these documents to their customers.</P>
        <P>The CER has a specific statutory responsibility for the protection of vulnerable energy customers. This is in line with the provisions of EU Electricity and Gas Directives (2003/54/EC and 2003/55/EC) which have been transposed into Irish law. CER guidelines provide for the protection of household electricity and gas customers, particularly the elderly and customers relying on life support.  The provisions require industry registers of such customers to be maintained in both gas and electricity.  Once a customer is registered, elderly customers may not be disconnected from either electricity or gas during winter months if they have difficulties with payment of their bills.  For customers on life support, disconnection may not be requested at any stage.</P>
        <P>In establishing requirements for suppliers the CER has taken full account of developments with respect to consumer protection at EU level.  A number of concepts set out in the proposed EU Energy Consumer Charter are already in place in the Irish context.  In particular, customers are protected from unfair selling practices and have access to a simple change of supplier process should they decide to switch supplier.  This is particularly important as the gas and electricity markets develop and competition continues to grow.</P>

        <P>Under the terms of the contract, the NBS broadband products will be upgraded to higher specifications (speeds, contention and data caps) in July 2010 and October 2012 without any increase in the monthly recurring charge.</P><Col N="105"/>
        <P>In recognition of the fact that some areas will be very difficult to reach using standard infrastructure, 3 will make available a satellite product, which is expected to cover around 5% of the NBS areas.

	<P>As indicated in the Minister&rsquo;s answer to Parliamentary Question number <Col N="106"/>393 of 24th February 2009, a Geothermal Working Group was established by the Department in 2008 to set out the options for the development of a proportionate and realistic regulatory regime for geothermal energy utilisation in Ireland.  As part of this process, a public consultation was held between June and August 2008.  Over 30 submissions were received, mainly from people and organisations closely associated with geothermal energy development in Ireland.  The results of the consultation exercise are currently being analysed.  I expect the Working Group to report to me shortly.</P>
        <P>The Working Group will report on effective regulatory and other measures that could be taken to increase the contribution of geothermal energy to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s targets for use of alternative energy.  The legal aspects of a regulatory framework are among the issues under examination.  Complex legal issues arise and consideration of these will impact on the timing of the Working Group&rsquo;s report.  I will decide on the need for legislation after I have considered that report.</P>

	<P>I am aware of a recent EU publication about the emergency access telephone number 112, which claims that there is a low level of awareness of the number in Ireland. </P>
        <P>The emergency access number 112 was introduced to meet two objectives; the first being to provide a single access emergency number at a national level and the second being to provide a single access emergency number across all of the EU.</P>
        <P>Ireland was one of a few EU Member States that traditionally has used a single emergency access number (999). The 999 and 112 emergency access numbers operate in parallel and provide a connection to the emergency services from both fixed and mobile telecommunications operators offering public switched telecommunications services.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives have been put in place to increase familiarity with the 112 number.  The 112 emergency number was advertised recently in the handbook &ldquo;Preparing for Major Emergencies&rdquo; which was issued by the Department of Defence to every household in Ireland and contained detail about the use of the number 112.</P>
        <P>The 112 emergency access number is advertised at strategic locations around the country such as airports, ports and public telephone boxes. The emergency services also advertise the 112 number on some of their emergency vehicles. The Department&rsquo;s website also contains information on the 112 emergency access number. The Department will continue to consider ways to increase awareness of the 112 emergency access number.</P>

	<P>The National energy targets set in the Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government for 2010 are 15% of electricity, 5% of heat and 5% of transport fuels to be from renewable sources. The objective is to deliver progressively on these targets, and the targets for 2020, on an annual basis. The estimated figures for 2008 show that approximately 11% for electricity, 4% for heat and 1% of transport are now from renewable sources.</P>
        <P>The EU agreed the new renewable energy Directive in December 2008 as part of the Climate Change and Renewable Energy Package.</P>

The EU renewable energy target set for Ireland of 16% for the electricity, heat and transport sectors by 2020 is consistent with the Government&rsquo;s own 2020 targets set in the Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government. The following table shows the national 2020 targets in each sector and how they will contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s 16% of energy EU target.</P>

	<P>Energy storage for electricity production has been developed in Ireland where it can make a useful contribution to balancing electricity supply and consumer demand.  This is the case at the ESB&rsquo;s pumped water power station at Turlough Hill which has an installed electricity generating capacity of 292 megawatts. </P>
        <P>The &ldquo;All Island Grid Study&rdquo; published early last year, examines the ability of the electricity systems on an All-Island basis to absorb power from renewable energy powered projects.  Its finding shows that a target of 42% is feasible without any major increase in pumped storage.  The Study is not prescriptive on the alternative technologies, including pumped storage, which <Col N="109"/>a liberalised electricity market may bring forward to balance customer demand and supply as the renewable energy powered capacity increases.  Several private developers are understood to be currently examining proposals which may lead to additional pumped storage projects being developed.</P>
        <P>It is possible that new technology developments could enhance the viability of storage options in the future in the open market.  Developments will be kept under close review by the Department in consultation with EirGrid and the energy sector.</P>

	<P>The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control on petroleum products and it has been the policy of successive Governments to promote the model of free and fair competition with the objective of creating greater price competition and wide consumer choice.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment requested the National Consumer Agency (NCA) to undertake a survey on retail prices of petrol and diesel.  The NCA has now completed its report, which is available at www.consumerconnect.ie.</P>
        <P>The NCA Report confirms that there is little evidence to suggest unwarranted delays in the passing on of wholesale price changes to the consumer at the pump.  The report noted in particular that the prices that Irish retailers charge for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  The refinery price for oil products varies with demand and does not always move in line with crude oil prices.  There is a time lag between movements in crude prices and refined prices.</P>
        <P>The prices at the pump reflect global market price, transportation costs, euro/dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.  Price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy and it is a matter for retailers to explain price differences where they occur.</P>
        <P>The report also identified the need to improve the manner in which information on petrol and diesel prices in Ireland is collected, analysed and made available.  My Department is working with the European Commission and the oil industry to improve the transparency and relevance of price statistics both in Ireland and across the EU.</P>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an oppor<Col N="111"/>tunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments.  CE is not designed to cater for short-term unemployed persons as they are not as far removed from the open labour market as the main client group for the programme. To facilitate some short-term employment opportunities, breaks off the Live Register of up to 30 days are permissible with the 12-month eligibility period, while still maintaining eligibility for CE.</P>
        <P>The 30-day Live Register break ensures that the CE programme responds to its primary target group of long term unemployed clients.  Many unemployed people engage in work of a temporary nature.  If the programme were open to this cohort, people may leave their employment, albeit of a temporary nature, in order to participate in Community Employment.  This would be contrary to the objective of the programme and result in a Labour Market intervention competing with the open labour market.  In circumstances where breaks of the Live Register exceed 30 days, other interventions may be more appropriate than CE.</P>
        <P>CE remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment. The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  F&Aacute;S provides a range programmes aimed specifically at the short-term unemployed, details of which are available from any F&Aacute;S Employment Services office, Local Employment Service offices or from the F&Aacute;S website <i>www.fas.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>In conclusion I should say that the operation of the Scheme is being kept under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.</P>

	<P>Government funding of Skillnets Training which supports enterprise-led training in the workplace, has increased in recent years. This level of increased funding is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to upskilling persons in employment, with particular emphasis on those with low basic skills, to retain and enhance employability and maintain competitiveness. The Programme&rsquo;s budget is provided through the National Training Fund with levels of  matching funding provided by the private sector.  All budgetary allocations are currently under review in the context of the deteriorating economic and budgetary position and the measures to be announced on 7th April in that regard.</P>

	<P>The choice of mortgage product ultimately rests with consumers in light of their assessment of the terms and conditions that their lending institution offers. The decision of borrowers is influenced by a range of factors such as their personal preferences and their own assessment of the relative merits of fixed and variable rate mortgages.</P>
        <P>Generally mortgages are for long periods. To some consumers a fixed interest rate on a mortgage offers peace of mind in that the borrower benefits from certainty regarding the cost of their mortgage, does not need to be concerned with changes in mortgage interest rates and accordingly he or she can budget more confidently.</P>
        <P>Where a bank offers a fixed rate over a certain period it incurs additional costs in obtaining fixed or other funding in respect of the loan over the period. The additional costs will reflect both the market view in relation to future trends in interest rates for the period and the fact that longer term deposits generally attract higher interest rates than short term. In addition, if a borrower wishes to break a fixed interest rate contract prior to the end of the agreed term in order to change to a variable interest rate contract, it will generally result in funding costs for the lender concerned. If financial institutions were prohibited from charging customers for the funding costs, the price and availability of fixed rate mortgages is likely to be adversely affected.</P>

	<P>The rules governing the artists tax exemption scheme are set out in section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and in the related Guidelines drawn up under that section.  These Guidelines are drawn up by the Arts Council and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The current Guidelines have been in place since 1994.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides an exemption from tax for the profits or gains arising to a person from the publication, production or sale of an original and creative work which has artistic or cultural merit in any of the five categories set out in the legislation, namely, a book or other writing; a play; a musical composition; a painting or other like picture; or a sculpture. The legislation does not include a definition of the term &lsquo;the arts&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>Under the legislation, the Revenue Commissioners are required to make a determination as to whether or not a work has artistic or cultural merit before the exemption can be awarded.  The Commissioners are specifically required by the legislation to make their determination having regard to the Guidelines.  The Guidelines set out definitions of the terms original and creative, artistic merit and cultural merit.  They also set out specific criteria to be taken into account in making determinations relating to works of non-fiction and provide for exclusions from what is to be regarded as original and creative in respect of certain works (e.g. textbooks, works of journalism and functional or utilitarian works).  The Guidelines are available on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Guidelines, the legislation allows the Revenue Commissioners to consult as necessary with expert bodies, such as the Arts Council and the Heritage Council, to assist them in determining whether a work meets the criteria set out in the legislation and the Guidelines.  Persons seeking the exemption are entitled under the legislation to appeal determinations made by the Revenue Commissioners to the Appeal Commissioners.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware, tax relief for donations to sports bodies is confined to donations in respect of capital projects.

	<P>I am informed by The Revenue Commissioners that the additional revenue that would be generated by applying a VAT rate of 5% to goods currently at 0%, which if moved could continue to attract a reduced VAT rate, with effect from April 1 is estimated to be &euro;204 million in 2009 and &euro;349 million in 2010 and have a CPI effect of 0.60%.  On the same basis, the additional yield from increasing those goods from the zero rate to 13.5% is estimated to be &euro;550 million for 2009 and &euro;942 million in 2010 with a CPI effect of 1.61%.  I would point out that under EU VAT law, if certain products, such as children&rsquo;s clothes and footwear were to be moved from the zero rate they would have to be made subject to the standard VAT rate of 21.5%. Accordingly they are excluded from the costing provided above.</P>

The yield in 2009, if implemented from 1 April, would be of the order of &euro;15 million.  However, I should point out that this would create an anomalous situation where an individual would be liable to the income levy at a rate of 1 per cent up to a ceiling of &euro;100,100, a rate of 3 per cent on income from &euro;100,101 to &euro;200,000, a rate of 2 per cent on income from &euro;200,001 to &euro;250,120 and a rate of 3 per cent on the balance.  The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2005 adjusted as necessary for income and employment growth for 2009. They are therefore provisional and likely to be revised.</P>

	<P>A restriction of mortgage interest relief for new first time buyers along the lines suggested by the Deputy would not generate an Exchequer saving in the cost of tax relief before 2012.  However, if it is assumed that the average mortgage is &euro;225,000, the average mortgage rate is 3.75%, the average length of mortgage for first time buyers is 30 years, non-first time buyer relief is not available to these first time buyers after 3 years and no other changes are made to mortgage interest relief provisions, the saving from this measure would be approximately &euro;6.5m per 1,000 new first time buyers.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer of all income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available, are set out in the following tables for 2004 and 2005, the most recent year for which the necessary historical information is available in the required detail. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.</P>
        <P>These estimates of cost are not compiled by reference to sectors.</P>
     <P el="10"><b>COST OF TAX CREDITS, ALLOWANCES AND RELIEFS 2005 AND 2004</b></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="0">The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system.  A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity.  The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the &ldquo;costs&rdquo; of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a &ldquo;loss of tax revenue&rdquo; on profits. To compute such &ldquo;loss&rdquo;, regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">The figures of cost are for 2005 and 2004 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).</P><Col N="120"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged.  It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs.  Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits.  For instance, a person with &euro;1,000 gross trading profits, &euro;1,000 capital allowances and &euro;1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on &euro;1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn.  In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on &euro;1,000.  Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10">Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information. Some of the cost figures included in the table for 2004 reflect revisions to figures previously published in the 2006 Report.</P>

        <P el="0"><Miles com="is0p4" />(1) <Miles com="ix" />Figures accompanied by an asterisk * are particularly tentative and subject to a considerable margin of error.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(2) <Miles com="ix" />The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits. They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(3) <Miles com="ix" />The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(4) <Miles com="ix" />Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(5) <Miles com="ix" />Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a &ldquo;net pay&rdquo; basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(6) <Miles com="ix" />See the following table &ldquo;<b>Green Paper on Pensions</b>&rdquo; for background commentary and cost figures for 2006.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(7) <Miles com="ix" />Arising from the work on the &ldquo;<b>Green Paper on Pensions&rdquo;</b> (2007) the basis for costing this item has been changed for 2005 and is not directly comparable with the figures <Col N="123"/>for earlier years. See also the following table &ldquo;<b>Green Paper on Pensions</b>&rdquo; for more recent figures.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(8) <Miles com="ix" />The figures shown for <b>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts</b> for 2004 are derived from personal tax returns and are understated because they do not include contributions made by employers or by employees through their employers. See 2005 and the following table &ldquo;<b>Green Paper on Pensions</b>&rdquo; for more complete figures.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />(9) <Miles com="ix" />&ldquo;Other&rdquo; relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership or to pay death duties.</P>
        <P el="5">(10) <Miles com="ix" />The cost of exempting the income of charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. from income tax includes the sums repaid in respect of tax credits and income tax deducted at source (certain dividends, other investment income and payments received under covenant), donations made by the PAYE sector to approved bodies but does not include income tax relief in respect of donations made by the self-employed. It also includes the cost of exempting certain bodies from the deduction on income arising from government securities. Information is not available about other income received gross.</P>
        <P el="5">(11) <Miles com="ix" />The cost figures for relief for donations to Approved Sports Bodies and for certain Sports Persons are based on self assessment returns.</P>
        <P el="5">(12) <Miles com="ix" />In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be appropriate in many cases.</P>
        <P el="5">(13) <Miles com="ix" />The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2004 and 2005.</P>
        <P el="5">(14) <Miles com="ix" />The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with &ldquo;unused capital allowances&rdquo;, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company&rsquo;s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that &euro;3500 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2005 accounting periods but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.</P>
        <P el="5">(15) <Miles com="ix" />The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of  claims  made in 2004 and 2005 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.</P>
        <P el="5">(16) <Miles com="ix" />The cost does not include any notional cost associated with IFSC companies. The International Financial Services activity in Ireland represents new business which has developed as a result of, among other things, the concessionary tax rate. This means that as the cost of the concessionary rate is not just the difference between the concessionary tax rate and the full tax rate, it is therefore not quantifiable. In regard to the cost shown for the effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and certain other <Col N="124"/>activities, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises may not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of the cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.</P>
        <P el="5">(17) <Miles com="ix" />The cost shown for R&amp;D is for claims for R&amp;D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2005. However, the cost includes the cost associated with claims where the company was entitled to the credit but was unable to absorb it in that accounting year.</P>
        <P el="10" FLI="0"><b>Green Paper on Pensions &mdash; updated estimates of cost for 2006</b></P>
        <P el="0" FLI="1">As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="1">The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Arising from the review, estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision for 2006 have been made. Further work required to provide similar estimates for 2005 has now been completed and estimates of cost for that year are included in the main TABLE IT6. As similar data sources would not be available for previous years, it is not possible to provide costings on a similar basis for those years.</P>

        <P el="0">The figures shown relate to the various reliefs/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2005  form 11 and CT1.			</P>
        <P FLI="1" el="10">There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns. Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax  returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.</P>
       <P FLI="1" el="10">The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 42% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax. This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually  subject to tax.</P>
        <P FLI="1" el="10">Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6. For example, exempt income included above is not part of capital allowances.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 to 98, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the receipts from betting duty are set out below. The decrease in yield for 2007 arose from the reduction in the betting duty from 2% to 1% with effect from 1 July 2006.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">2006 &mdash; &euro;54.3m</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">2007 &mdash; &euro;36.4m</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">2008 &mdash; &euro;36.6m (estimate)</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Arising from the slowdown in economic activity it seems clear that betting turnover will be significantly lower in 2009, which will be reflected in lower than anticipated betting duty yields. Taking into account the duty increase to 2% which only comes into effect from 1 May, the betting duty yield for 2009 is at this stage estimated at approximately &euro;47m.</P>
        <P>The increase in the betting duty to 2% from 1 May 2009 involves a tax increase for bookmakers and not those actually placing bets.  In that regard there is no particular incentive for punters, on foot of this change, to place bets with out-of-State internet or telephone operations rather than through bookmakers&rsquo; offices.</P>

        <P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides the framework for the repayment of recoverable health charges to those who were incorrectly charged for publicly funded long stay care. The Act only provides for prescribed repayments to be made in respect of recoverable health charges. Recoverable health charges are charges for in-patient services, imposed on persons with full eligibility, under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended, and the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954. For the purpose of the <Col N="133"/>Scheme both medical card holders and those entitled to medical cards are deemed to be persons with full eligibility.</P>
        <P>The estates of all those fully eligible persons who were incorrectly charged and who died since 9 December 1998 are eligible for repayment under the scheme provided a valid application form was submitted prior to the closing date.</P>

	<P>Data collected by the Cystic Fibrosis Registry indicates that there are over 1,100 people with cystic fibrosis in the Republic of Ireland. Approximately 52% are adults and 48% are children. St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital is the national adult tertiary referral centre for patients with cystic fibrosis and treats over 50% of the adult population with the condition. In recognition of the need to improve the quality of accommodation available to these patients a number of capital projects have been completed at the hospital. This includes the refurbishment of accommodation to provide eight single en suite rooms which was completed last year. A new ward block is also to be built, to include 120 beds in single en-suite accommodation. The new facility will include accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients, with appropriate isolation facilities. Design work and preparation of tender documents is continuing in respect of the development. My Department has asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the specific isolation facilities available at individual hospitals.</P>

	<P>Substantial resources are invested in mental health services. Estimated spending on mental health services in 2007 amounted to &euro;1 billion and this level of funding continued into 2008 and 2009. Additional funding totalling &euro;51.2m was allocated to the HSE in 2006 and 2007 for the development of services in line with &lsquo;A Vision for Change&rsquo;. Some of this money was diverted because of core budgetary pressures; however, I am advised by the HSE that 94% of the &euro;51.2m will be in place before the end of 2009. Additional funding has been provided in 2009 for the recruitment of 35 therapy posts for the child and adolescent mental health service. In addition, once-off funding of &euro;1.75m has been provided for suicide prevention initiatives and for mental health projects supporting service users and carers.</P>

In relation to bodies under the remit of my Department, the salary of the Director of Food, Science and Standards of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is linked to that of the Assistant Secretary scale on a strictly personal basis. This arrangement was approved by the Department of Finance as an exceptional measure on the basis of a case made to my Department by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the guidelines followed by immigration officers at Irish airports in making a decision as to whether to allow somebody enter the country if they have already obtained a visa (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>It is necessary for a non-national in the circumstances set out by the Deputy to apply for a visa at the Irish Embassy or consular office nearest to where he/she resides.  Such matters as ability to be able to support himself/herself and provide accommodation for himself/herself without working in Ireland will be part of the assessment procedure in deciding whether to grant or refuse the visa.  It should be noted that a visa only entitles the holder to present himself/herself to an immigration officer at a port of entry.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004 provides that an immigration officer may, on behalf of the Minister, give to a non-national a document, or place on his or her passport, or other equivalent document, an inscription authorising the non-national to land or be in the State.  This is effectively permission to remain and reside in the State.</P>
        <P>Section 4 also provides that an immigration officer may, on behalf of the Minister, refuse to give a permission to a non-national, if the officer is satisfied:</P>
<P el="5">(a) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national is not in a position to support himself or herself and any accompanying dependants;</P>
<P el="5">(b) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national intends to take up employment in the State, but is not in possession of a valid employment permit;</P>
<P el="5">(c) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national suffers from a condition specified in First Schedule accompanying the Act;</P>
<P el="5">(d) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national has been convicted (whether in this State or elsewhere) of an offence that may be punished under the law of the place of conviction by imprisonment for a period of one year or by a more severe penalty;</P><Col N="140"/>
<P el="5">(e) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national, not being exempt from the requirement to have an Irish visa, is not the holder of a valid Irish visa;</P>
<P el="5">(f) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national is the subject of a deportation order, exclusion order or a determination by the Minister that it is conducive to the public good that the person remains outside the State;</P>
<P el="5">(g) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national is not in possession of a valid passport or other equivalent document;</P>
<P el="5">(h) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national intends to travel to Great Britain or Northern Ireland and would not qualify for admission to those places;</P>
<P el="5">(i) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national, having arrived as a seaman, has remained on after the ship&rsquo;s departure without the leave of an immigration officer;</P>
<P el="5">(j) <Miles com="ix" />that the non-national&rsquo;s entry into, or presence in, the State could pose a threat to national security or be contrary to public policy, and</P>
<P el="5">(k) <Miles com="ix" />that there is reason to believe that the non-national intends to enter the State for the purposes other than those expressed by the non-national.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">A non-national will be interviewed by the Immigration Officer on arrival at the frontier of the State and the above legal provisions are effectively the guidelines applied by an immigration officer to assess a person who seeks permission to enter the State.  It is, therefore, a matter for such a person, prior to making a reservation to travel here, to satisfy himself/herself that he/she will be in a position to satisfy the immigration officer that he/she meets the above conditions.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in October 2008.</P>
        <P>The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months. The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of <Col N="141"/>straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale. Applications for certificates of naturalisation are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.</P>
        <P>There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>The legislation to address the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recommendations on multi-unit developments is in the course of being drafted by Parliamentary Counsel as a matter of priority. The principal focus of the new Bill will be on ensuring good governance of property management companies and similar bodies which comprise the owners of individual units within multi-unit developments and which exercise management functions in relation to such developments. It is also intended to include provisions for the resolution of disputes arising in relation to such matters. The policy aspects extend to my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The aim is to publish the Bill in the next Session.</P>
        <P>There is no legislation specific to the question of responsibility for payment of service charges in respect of unsold units in a multi-unit development.  However, the IHBA Code of Practice in relation to Multi-unit developments does stress that &ldquo;the developer will make good shortfalls in attributable service charge contributions arising from unsold units in a development until such time as the units are sold&rdquo;.  It is intended that the legislation that is being drafted will also address the matter.</P>

	<P>Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children. With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children&rsquo;s Court.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that 502 behaviour warnings were issued to adults in 2008 and 513 to children. In addition, eight formal good behaviour contracts were agreed in respect of children.  I am further informed that two civil orders (adult) and two behaviour orders (children) were issued by the courts in the same period.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The prison system is, of course, subject to peaks and troughs. As the Deputy will appreciate numbers are particularly high when the courts are at their busiest, giving rise to a high number of committals.  There has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years. This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months, where we have seen dramatic increases in the number of sentenced prisoners, those being committed on remand and a trend towards longer sentences. What is clear is that there is a trend of increased committals from the courts.</P>
        <P>It has to be acknowledged that the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts. Figures show, over the past 12 years, the numbers in custody have increased by 65%. This can be attributed, in part, to greater resourcing of the Garda&iacute;, more stringent legislation, detection and prosecution of crimes.</P>
        <P>Whilst I acknowledge that prison overcrowding is an issue I equally would say that the continuation of the current capital programme is necessary to deal with the overcrowding problem in the future so that we can build on the significant progress made over the last decade or so in improving and modernising our prisons.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 in excess of 1,300 prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system. These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the D&oacute;chas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick Prison.</P>
        <P>However, given the serious pressure that the Irish Prison Service has been experiencing during the last 12-18 months, in 2008 it became necessary to introduce additional contingency accommodation through the doubling up of cells in Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Midlands and Arbour Hill Prisons and in the Training Unit. This provided 180 temporary bed spaces.</P>
        <P>As the pressure shows no sign of abating the Irish Prison Service recently decided to increase their capacities through the doubling up of further cells, thus creating 200 additional temporary bed spaces which will come on stream shortly.</P>
        <P>In 2008, 70 new prison spaces were introduced at Shelton Abbey and Loughan House Open Centres.  Furthermore, building projects in Castlerea, Wheatfield and Portlaoise Prisons are due to be completed in the coming months. This will create an additional 400 extra spaces <Col N="144"/>which will temporarily alleviate the situation pending the construction of new prisons at Thornton Hall, Co. Dublin and Kilworth, Co. Cork.</P>

Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 10 March 2008, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her son.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making <Col N="145"/>of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her son should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in respect of herself and her son and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</P>
        <P>In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.</P>

        <P>The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months.  The Citizenship Division is currently commencing further processing of applications received in mid 2007.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.</P>
        <P>There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to a settlement between the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) and Eircom which has been reported in the press. I understand that this agreement has not been published and is essentially a private agreement between the two parties in connection with the downloading of copyrighted music from the internet.  Because the issues involved relate to copyright law and the telecommunications infrastructure, I must inform the Deputy that my Department has no responsibility in relation to this matter.</P>

	<P>Existing legislation makes extensive provision for unmarried fathers with respect to their children.  Under the law as it stands &mdash; section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987 &mdash; an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child.  Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian. Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including directions as to custody and access.  In addition, the section provides that the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for orders on custody and access.  Section 3 of the Act provides that, in deciding on an application relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the location referred to is in Clontarf Sub-District.  Local Garda management is aware of difficulties being experienced by residents in this area as a result of anti-social behaviour, and the area has been designated a public order hot-spot.  A member of the local Community Policing Unit is allocated to this area and liaises with the local community.  The Community Garda attends regular meetings with residents and any issues raised are attended to.  The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, <Col N="157"/>including the Community Policing Unit, the Garda Mountain Bike Unit and the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  Persons and vehicles are regularly stopped and searched in this area.</P>
        <P>Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and dealt with appropriately, including by juvenile or adult caution, fixed charge notices or initiating criminal proceedings.  Any persons found engaging in such behaviour will continue to be dealt with appropriately in accordance with the law.  Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.</P>

They arise in the areas of responsibility of the Private Security Authority, the Irish Film Classification Office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Firearms Division of my Department. They relate to the regulation of the private security industry in the State, authorisations for the sale of videos and the licensing of dealers and individuals in respect of firearms and the importation of explosives.  Over the past three years, almost 25,000 licences have been issued to both individuals and companies.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 192 together.</P>
        <P>During 2008 an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work to develop a National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. Unfortunately, faced with the current economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time lines which could be achieved. In that context, rather than publishing a document which does not include any significant plans for the future, the Government has decided not to publish a strategy at this time.</P><Col N="162"/>
        <P>All work on the development of the strategy including research, the management of the public consultation process and the preparation of draft material was carried out by officials in my Department in conjunction with the members of the interdepartmental working group. The public consultation process undertaken between February and April 2008 was advertised in all regional and national newspapers at a cost of &euro;128,000. There were no costs in respect of consultancies or other services.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that it is disappointing for carers and the people for whom they care that we are not in a position to publish a strategy at this time. I met with some of their representatives last week to inform them of this difficult decision taken by Government. I also wanted to acknowledge all those who took the time to make submissions as part of the public consultation process and to assure them that those submissions were considered in detail by the working group and will inform our thinking in the future.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the sacrifices made by the many people who care for others and has sought to make many improvements in services and supports for carers.  Over the past decade, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer&rsquo;s benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  In relation to income supports, in Budget 2009, I increased the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for those aged 66 or over by &euro;7 to &euro;239 per week and for those aged under 66 by &euro;6.50 to &euro;220.50 per week. These increases took effect from January 2009. Recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that the combined expenditure on carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carers will be &euro;650 million in 2009.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is committed to continuing to work with the carer representative groups to deliver services in the most effective way and to support the carer groups in the valuable work they do in helping carers.</P>

	<P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution of &euro;18, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The maximum rent supplement for a lone parent with one child in Co. Kildare is &euro;953 per month. The Executive has advised that the person concerned is in receipt of rent supplement of &euro;875 per month i.e. rent of &euro;953 less the minimum contribution of &euro;18 a week (&euro;78 per month). </P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  Mortgage interest supplement provides short-term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</P>
        <P>The Executive has advised the person concerned was in receipt of mortgage interest supplement from 2 July 2007 to 31 December 2008 when payment ceased as he returned to full-time employment on 3 January 2009. He left employment on 14 January 2009 on health grounds and recently presented to the community welfare officer to have his payment re-instated. The Executive has advised that his claim is currently under consideration.</P>

	<P>The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 states that any public servant who is a member of a public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme, or receives a payment in lieu of membership in such a scheme, is subject to a deduction from their remuneration.</P>
        <P>In 1996, changes were introduced to the superannuation scheme affecting Non Officers, including part time employees.  Part time employees were allowed to join the contributory Local Government (Superannuation Revision) (Consolidation) Scheme, 1986, on the same basis as it applies to other employees.  Part time employees who did not wish to join the scheme had the Local Government (Superannuation) (Gratuities) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995 applied to them. This is a payment in lieu of membership of a pension scheme, and part time employees eligible for such a payment are subject to the deduction outlined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.</P>

	<P>Under the shared ownership scheme, houses are acquired by a local authority by means of borrowing through the Housing Finance Agency and leased to the shared owner, who purchases at least 40% of the value of the house and rents the remaining equity from the local authority. The rent payments that shared ownership purchasers make are intended largely to meet the cost of financing the rented share in the equity of the house.</P>
        <P>Exchequer cost in respect of the shared ownership scheme is confined to the payment of rental subsidy to local authorities to reduce the monthly outgoings of purchasers with household income below &euro;28,000 in the previous tax year. The table following sets out the amount of rental subsidy paid to local authorities from 1999 to 2008:</P>

        <Quest> the reason the pension related deduction for public servants is being deducted from firemen&rsquo;s pay in view of the fact that these firemen are only employed on a part-time non-pensionable basis (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 states that any public servant who is a member of a public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme, or receives a payment in lieu of membership in such a scheme, is subject to a deduction from their remuneration.</P>
        <P>In 2008, retained firefighters were given the option of joining the Local Government Superannuation Scheme (LGSS).  Retained firefighters who opted not to join the scheme receive, on retirement, a gratuity of 1/8th of the annual retainer multiplied by the number of years of actual service (up to a maximum of four times the annual retainer).  This is a payment in lieu of membership of a pension scheme, and as such retained firefighters are subject to the deduction outlined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the decision by the High Court in Germany which ordered a return to the ballot box dismissing the country&rsquo;s electronic voting machines as out of keeping with the principle of fair and open elections; and if he will support this view here. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the recent decision in the German courts in relation to the future use of electronic voting machines in the conduct of elections held in that country.</P>
        <P>Relevant experiences and developments in other jurisdictions are being taken into account in considering the next steps in relation to electronic voting and counting in Ireland. As part of this process, I am also taking into account the work of the Commission on Electronic Voting, which has examined the system, the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the Programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.</P><Col N="168"/>
        <P>Given the scale of investment in the system to date, and the importance of the issues involved for our electoral system, it is essential that the future of the project be examined objectively and in a thorough and comprehensive manner. It is important that we come to the best possible decision.  It is not possible to make more specific comment at this point on the project itself, or on future plans for the machines, pending completion of the necessary work and a decision by Government in the matter.</P>

        <P>In this regard, RT&Eacute; has reviewed the potential for providing these services over different media, including via the Internet and on the UK Freesat service.</P>
        <P>RT&Eacute; is proposing to pursue and expand access to its programming via the Internet, and has highlighted that this will be available to the Irish abroad.  However, RT&Eacute; has informed the Department that its plans to launch a Freesat service in the UK in early 2009 have been postponed.  RT&Eacute; has indicated that this decision was made as a result of the economic downturn, which has adversely affected RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s commercial service, and is part of a necessary cost saving exercise being undertaken by RT&Eacute; this year.</P>
        <P>RT&Eacute; has indicated that this decision may be reviewed if circumstances change significantly in the course of the year.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.   The Regulation requires the Irish authorities to prepare a national Eel Management Plan for implementation from 1 July 2009 or from the earliest possible time before that date.</P>
        <P>The EU target is clearly defined in the Regulation where it states that the objective of each Member State&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influ<Col N="174"/>ences had impacted the stock. In other words, the Regulation requires that 4kg of eels escape to sea for every 10kg that would have escaped if people didn&rsquo;t kill any or stop any migrating, and the number of elvers coming into the water was as high as it ever was.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s level of escapement is currently estimated at only 24%.  When the last 20 years of poor recruitment is taken into account, I am advised that it is likely that the adult eel stock in Irish waters will continue to decline for at least the next decade.</P>
        <P>Given the critical status of the eel stock, as demonstrated in the assessment contained in the draft National Eel Management Plan, a number of management measures have been identified as necessary to reach the targets set in the EU Regulation, including closure of the commercial and recreational fishery from 2009.  In addition it is also necessary to mitigate the impact of hydropower on escapement, to ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers and to improve water quality.</P>
        <P>When considering the measures proposed by the working group comprising scientists and fisheries managers who prepared the draft national Eel Management Plan, I did take account of the contrary views expressed by certain of the Regional Fisheries Boards.  These did not, however, offer alternative proposals that were in the control of the Irish authorities or that delivered on the obligations under the EC regulation for conservation of stocks. The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken as a conservation measure to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible, which if all the measures proposed are adopted and if other EU Member States adopt a similar conservative approach, could be as long as 90 years (i.e. an average of 4 eel generations).</P>
        <P>Under the Regulation, all aspects of the plan must be reviewed in 2012.  This review will consider, inter alia, whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any river basin district in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of the stocks.</P>

	<P>If a company with a petroleum exploration licence were to make a commercial discovery of oil offshore it would be required to bring forward a detailed plan of development for my approval.  Any such plan of development could be based on a mobile production facility or a tieback to a land based facility.  The development would be governed by a petroleum lease agreed between the State and the developer and would be subject to the Department&rsquo;s licensing terms for oil and gas exploration and production, which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The tax treatment of profits from any oil discovery would be governed by the Finance Acts.</P>

	<P>It has been long-standing Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to compete in a liberalised market, provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide, customer-focussed network of post offices.</P>
        <P>While the Government will support An Post and its network in any way it can, it is the responsibility of the board and management of the company to make strategic decisions regarding its future and how it will prepare itself for future competition, particularly in advance of the full liberalisation of the postal sector, set to happen in 2011.</P>
        <P>In preparation for competition, it is vital that the company restructures itself effectively and that management and trade unions in An Post work together to transform the company into an efficient, innovative and modern service provider by implementing the agreed restructuring programme and providing innovative new service arrangements for the public.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 220 together.</P>
        <P>The regulation of telecommunications operators, including regulatory issues surrounding the quality of services and coverage in the mobile phone market, is the responsibility of the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and the Regulations which transpose <Col N="176"/>the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications.  The relevant service providers operate in a fully liberalised market.</P>
        <P>The widespread provision of telecommunications services continues to be a major priority for the Government.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector providers.  Where market failure has occurred in the provision of electronic communications the Government has intervened such as in the case of the provision of broadband infrastructure in the regions and the National Broadband Scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish telecommunications market is healthy and competitive. ComReg&rsquo;s Market Report, in respect of quarter ended 30 September 2008, shows that the overall electronic telecommunications network and service revenues at the end of September 2008 were approximately &euro;4.44 billion per annum.  Full details of the latest progress in the Irish telecommunications market are available in ComReg&rsquo;s Irish Communications Market: Key Data Report &mdash; Q3 2008, on<i> www.comreg.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Department plays an active role in negotiations on telecommunication matters at EU level and I will continue to engage with the Council of Ministers in seeking to ensure that the regulatory framework is designed to further improve the quality and availability of telecommunications services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215, 224 and 225 together.</P>
        <P>The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes resulted in 18 projects being awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010.  Of these projects there are four in the biodiesel category, four in the bioethanol category, five in the pure plant oil category and five in the captive fleets category.</P>
        <P>The schemes were designed as interim measures to enhance the level of biofuels in the fuel mix and to encourage the development of an indigenous biofuels industry.  The Government&rsquo;s <Col N="177"/>Bioenergy Action Plan which was published in 2007, made clear that a national biofuels obligation would replace the relief schemes by the time those schemes came to a close at the end of 2010. Proposals are being finalised for the introduction of the obligation scheme next year.</P>
        <P>Since the start of the relief schemes there has been a steady increase in biofuels used in Ireland albeit from a very low base. Prior to the introduction of the schemes, market penetration of biofuels was almost non existent.  In 2007, the latest year for which figures are available, market penetration had risen to 0.6%.  Continued increase in penetration is anticipated in the 2008 statistics.</P>
        <P>There have been at least five biofuels plants constructed or redeveloped on foot of excise relief granted under the schemes.  A number of others are either at an advanced stage of planning, or have received planning permission.  All but two of the projects are currently availing of the excise relief and my officials are in liaison with all project promoters on a regular basis in relation to progressing their projects.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the European biofuels industry generally, has experienced difficulties, with a prolonged period of price volatility culminating in recent negative trends which have seen the price of mineral diesel falling considerably. This has been exacerbated by rises in the price of feedstock for biofuels production. These two factors have caused severe competitive difficulties for the European and Irish biofuels sector. In addition, the availability of US subsidised biodiesel, known as &ldquo;B99&rdquo;, has placed considerable commercial pressure on the European and Irish industry.</P>
        <P>In this overall context, progress on constructing the production facilities benefiting under the Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme has been inevitably slow, despite some early successes.</P>
        <P>The Department has been working closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to support official EU measures to counter the US export subsidy accorded to B99.  An EU Commission response is expected this week which should bring relief for hard pressed European and Irish Producers. Both EU action, in the short term and the introduction of the Biofuels Obligation in 2010 should provide the Irish biofuels sector with the certainty it needs to invest and grow its business in a sustainable way.</P>
        <P>The Biofuels Obligation will require fuel suppliers to provide a proportion of biofuels into the market.  This will be calculated as a percentage of mineral oil sales.  It will also ensure, through the full application of EU sustainability criteria, that biofuels in the Irish market are sustainably sourced.  Evolving technologies will also enable the penetration rate to be increased without impacts on food crops and prices.  Ireland has fully supported the introduction of EU sustainability criteria in the interests of the environment worldwide and in developing countries in particular.  They will also underpin further investment in indigenous biofuel production, and critical investment in second and third generation biofuels technology.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 221 together.</P>
        <P>At my request a number of weeks ago, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) undertook an urgent review of options to bring forward a reduction in energy prices for business and domestic consumers.  The need for an early review was underlined by the various cost pressures facing Irish businesses in the present economic climate.</P>
        <P>The CER has concluded that the best way of delivering a reduction in electricity prices in the short term is through the deferral of both transmission and distribution network revenues.  From May 1st, &euro;165 million of network revenue will be deferred for five months and recovered over the following twelve months.</P>
        <P>Downward trends in global gas prices and higher sales of gas by BG&Eacute; during the cold winter months, have also allowed the CER to bring forward a 12% reduction in BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s regulated gas tariffs to residential and small industrial and commercial customers to May 1st.</P>
        <P>In addition, over the last six months many large energy users have already experienced reductions of up to 25% in their energy costs.  This is because they are on flexible tariffs which track movements in gas prices and they have benefitted immediately from the reducing gas prices, albeit from the peak prices of mid 2008.</P>
        <P>Energy costs are an issue for the enterprise sector but although energy costs are relatively high in Ireland, Irish industries tend to have relatively low energy cost intensities.  There are a number of exceptions, notably cement and alumina but typically, Irish large industry has energy intensities of the order of 1% to 3%.  Less than 100 industrial enterprises in Ireland, representing less than 1% of sectoral employment, have an energy intensity greater than 10%.</P>
        <P>Energy support programmes, offered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), are proving very successful in helping businesses reduce their energy usage and hence their costs.  The activity is proving that quite significant savings are achievable, even among firms that have been active in energy efficiency for some time.  Many firms are making significant gains and Irish industry is developing an international reputation for its efficiency activity.</P><Col N="179"/>
        <P>Long run data from the Large Industry Energy Network show that large firms that have engaged with SEI over several years have on average made efficiency gains of 33% beyond what otherwise would have been achieved.  This is a very significant saving, and each year the data are re-confirming that more cost savings can still be delivered.</P>
        <P>Ensuring a competitive, cost effective and sustainable energy sector is a key means of exerting downward pressure on energy prices, reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels and enhancing security of supply.  The full range of actions that the Government Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020.</P>
        <P>These actions include, but are not limited to, delivering competition and consumer choice through continuing the market liberalisation process.  In doing so we will ensure that the regulatory framework can meet the evolving energy policy challenges and focus, in particular, on creating jobs, growth and innovation in the energy sector.  These actions are essential to delivering an energy sector that provides a reliable and competitively priced energy supply in support of economic renewal and competitiveness.</P>

	<P>The South North gas pipeline, constructed by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (Northern Ireland), and running from Gormanstown in County Meath to Ballyclare in County Antrim has been in operation since October 2006</P>
        <P>The East-West and North-South electricity Interconnector projects are of strategic national importance and are key Government priorities.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is conducting consultations and preparing a planning application for the North/South interconnector, which it expects to submit to the Strategic Infrastructure Board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, this year.  Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) is similarly progressing consultation and planning for the Northern route of the interconnector.  The scheduled date for completion is 2012.</P>
        <P>The East-West Interconnector is a 500MW High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnector, which will link the electricity grids of Ireland and the UK.</P>
        <P>The East West interconnector will bring improved security of supply and increased competition in the single electricity market as well as assisting in achieving the Government&rsquo;s renewable targets.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is responsible for the development and ownership of the East-West interconnector on behalf of the State.  Working closely with the CER and with the Department, EirGrid is progressing the project to schedule and for completion operational start up, by 2012.  The project is on track to meet the completion date subject to the outcome of the planning processes.  The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Act 2008 provides the necessary legal basis for EirGrid to construct, own and operate an interconnector.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has included the East-West Interconnector on the list of strategic energy projects for funding under the European Economic Recovery Package, which is currently being negotiated in Brussels.</P><Col N="180"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control on petroleum products and it has been the policy of successive Governments to promote the model of free and fair competition with the objective of creating greater price competition and wide consumer choice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment requested the National Consumer Agency (NCA) to undertake a survey on retail prices of petrol and diesel.  The NCA has completed its report, which is available at <i>www.consumerconnect.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The NCA Report confirms that there is little evidence to suggest unwarranted delays in the passing on of wholesale price changes to the consumer at the pump.  The report noted in particular, that the prices that Irish retailers charge for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  The refinery price for oil products varies with demand and does not always move in line with crude oil prices.  There is a time lag between movements in crude prices and refined prices.</P>
        <P>The prices at the pump reflect global market price, transportation costs, euro/dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.  Price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy and it is a matter for retailers to explain price differences where they occur.</P>
        <P>The report also identified the need to improve the manner in which information on petrol and diesel prices in Ireland is collected, analysed and made available.  My Department is working with the European Commission and the Irish oil industry to improve the transparency and relevance of price statistics both in Ireland and as published in the EU oil price bulletin.</P>

	<P>An application under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; Scheme was received from the person named on the 15th May 2008.</P>
        <P>This application was selected for a ground eligibility and cross compliance inspection.  During the inspection discrepancies were found in relation to parcels Y16520034, Y16520056, Y16520022, Y16520023, Y16520025, Y17001029, Y17002018, Y17002037, Y17107024 and Y17107031.  As a result of these discrepancies, the claimed area for the Single Payment Scheme of 56.52 ha was reduced to 54.27 ha.  As the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held, penalties will be applied as per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme.  In this case the number entitlements held by the person named is 56.22.  As the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 3%, under EU Regulations, the difference between the area found and the area claimed is doubled and deducted from the area found.  As a result, the area put forward for payment under the Single Payment Scheme was 50.37 ha.</P>
        <P>For the Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; Scheme, the area declared of 38.20 ha was reduced to 36.03 ha as deductions were made on parcels Y16520022, Y16520023, Y16520025, Y16520034, Y16520056, Y17001029, Y17002017, Y17002018, Y17002037, Y17002039, Y17005040, Y17107024 and Y17107031.

	<P>The person named holds 25.38 standard entitlements valued at &euro;12,117.  In 2007 he leased a further 33.75 entitlements from his father and received a total payment of &euro;24,016 under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.</P>
        <P>A request was subsequently received by my Department from the lessor and lessee requesting that the lease be terminated at the end of 2007 and this request was granted.  In 2008 an application was received from the person named to gift these same entitlements to his father.  This was not necessary but did lead to a delay in making payment.  The person named <Col N="183"/>now holds entitlements to the value of &euro;12,117 and payment in respect of the 2008 Single Payment Scheme will issue shortly.</P>

	<P>Regulation (EC) No. 1774 of 2002 and Statutory Instrument No. 252 of 2008 lay down strict controls for the safe use and disposal of animal by-products, with a view to safeguarding human and animal health.  This regulation allows for an authorised premises meeting specified standards, known as a Collection Centre, to collect and treat certain animal by-products for the feeding of animals such as fur animals, dogs from recognised kennels and packs of hounds.</P>
        <P>It came to the attention of my Department that the person concerned was operating an unauthorised Collection Centre. The premises being used were inspected in July 2008 and the individual was instructed to discontinue operations immediately.</P>
        <P>An application was submitted to my Department on 1 August 2008 for authorisation of the premises as a Collection Centre but the application was incomplete, and the applicant was asked to supply the outstanding information. This has not been supplied as yet.</P>
        <P>My Department also requested that the individual concerned seek confirmation from the local authority that the disposal of wastewater from the premises complied with environmental legislation.

	<P>The funding in question will be used to provide for an expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) so that all schools in the country will be covered by the service. The additional funding available to NEPS, which represents a 33% increase over the 2008 allocation, will facilitate the recruitment of up to 50 further psychologists. It is envisaged that this will bring the number of NEPS psychologists by the end of 2009 above the proposed 200 incorporated in the Programme for Government. This investment will significantly enhance the capacity of our educational psychologists to directly support schools in the development and delivery of appropriate interventions for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>The funding is also being provided to the National Council for Special  Education in 2009 to increase the Council&rsquo;s capacity in the move towards the  full implementation of EPSEN. The additional funding will enable the Council to  continue to improve, plan and co-ordinate the delivery of services for children  with special needs.</P>
        <P>In addition, provision has been made for further investment in teacher training  in this area. This will ensure that teachers are provided with opportunities to  access continuing professional development so that the learning and teaching needs of all pupils with Special Educational Needs continue to be met.  The provision of high quality training ensures that pupils learning opportunities are enriched and learning outcomes are optimised.</P>
        <P>An integrated approach is being adopted by the education and health sectors to  target these additional resources to the areas of greatest need. Progress in  both sectors will be kept under review by the Office for Disability &amp; Mental  Health and the Cross-Sectoral Team of the Departments of Education and Science, and Health and Children during 2009.</P>

        <P>The Strategic Innovation Fund was introduced in 2006 and there have been two  cycles of funding to date. Projects approved under the Fund are aimed at institutional reform, enhancing teaching and learning, improving access and life long learning and enabling the development of fourth level activity. A review of the SIF is to commence later this year and is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions was introduced in 1998  and projects with a total value of &euro;865 million have been approved to date under the four cycles of the programme. In 2004, an international Assessment Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the PRTLI. The impact assessment concluded that the programme had very positive impacts on institutional strategic planning, inter-institutional co-operation and on the quality of research being produced in Ireland. It endorsed the essential link between  research and teaching and learning, and considered the programme to be ambitious and far-sighted and vital to underpinning the development of the research system in higher education.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I published the Report of the Strategy Group appointed to advise on the priorities for investment in ICT in Schools last July.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Report sets out a substantial agenda to be addressed across a range of complementary areas including continuing professional development; ICT equipment; software and digital content; broadband connectivity and technical support.  I acknowledged the significant challenges to be faced in fully implementing the Report&rsquo;s recommendations having regard to the economic situation and indeed, it was necessary to delay the implementation of some recommendations last year in order to meet demand led costs that arose elsewhere on my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, a number of the recommendations are being pursued.  The  National Centre for Technology in Education continues to provide advice and support to schools on the integration <Col N="186"/>of ICT into teaching and learning and to provide a range of ICT continuing professional development courses for teachers.  The role of the school&rsquo;s ICT coordinating teacher, with the support of the school principal, is being prioritised as central in the provision of ongoing ICT  support and advice to teachers. In this context, the NCTE is finalising a handbook, Planning and Implementing e-Learning in your School, for principals  and ICT co-ordinating teachers, A professional development course for ICT  coordinating teachers on the development of e-Learning Plans is also available.  It is intended to provide nationwide seminars on e-Learning and the first  tranche of these seminars, targeting ICT coordinating teachers in post-primary  schools were held late last year. The NCTE has set up a Virtual Learning  Environment (VLE), accessible by all ICT coordinating teachers who have  attended the seminars. This VLE will be used as a method of organising CPD and support groups at local level. It is also an efficient channel of communication  for the NCTE with this group of teachers, who are already actively exchanging  resources and ideas in this online community.</P>
        <P>The NCTE is also working with the support services supported by my Department to ensure that the integration of ICT is specifically incorporated into all the support service activities and that it is recognised as an integral part of all  curriculum development, support and training rather than an optional add-on.    My Department is currently evaluating tenders for the next round of the  Schools&rsquo; Broadband Programme and the range of services available to schools is  being expanded.   My Department is working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to pursue the Government objective of equipping second-level schools with 100Mb per second of broadband connectivity and installing local area networks as outlined in the Next  Generation Broadband Policy Paper.</P>
        <P>The NCTE continues to expand the substantial digital resources available on the web portal Scoilnet and is acquiring access to on-line reference materials,  following the establishment of a framework agreement for the purchase of  relevant digital content.</P>
        <P>On the question of ICT equipment, while new post-primary school buildings  projects included ICT equipment budgets there was no similar arrangement at  primary level.  I was pleased to announce that this situation was being  addressed with the provision of ICT equipment grants of &euro;2.2m recently issuing  to 72 primary schools where a newly constructed school, a large scale extension  or a system build facility reached practical completion in 2008.  These grants  will enable schools equip their new classrooms with an appropriate technology  configuration to integrate ICT into their teaching and learning.</P>
        <P>I am committed to investing in this area as resources permit and I recognise  the need to explore innovative and cost-effective ways in which we enhance the  classroom experience for students and teachers by effective use of ICT.  The  technology industry strongly advocates greater integration of ICT into teaching  and learning in our schools and my Department is working with industry to  explore possible approaches to implementing the recommendations set out in the  Strategy Group&rsquo;s Report, having regard to the funding for ICT in my Department&rsquo;s budget.</P>

	<P>In terms of the numbers of computers in schools, the 2005 Census of ICT Infrastructure in Schools, undertaken by the National Centre for Technology in Education found that the overall number of computers in schools had increased to an estimated 97,709, which implies an overall improvement in the pupil to computer ratio to 9.1:1 at primary and 7:1 at post-primary.</P>
        <P>My Department does not have a record of the number of schools that have  purchased new computers in the last five years and schools have undoubtedly  continued to acquire computers since 2005.  Indeed, under my Department&rsquo;s  School Building Programme, new post-primary school buildings projects include  ICT equipment budgets and as the Deputy may also be aware, some &euro;2.2m was  recently provided in ICT equipment grants to 72 primary schools in which a newly constructed school or large-scale extension was completed in 2008.    Grants were also issued to some 500 post-primary schools to upgrade their  facilities to provide the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and  Communication Graphics syllabus with effect from September 2007.  It is  understood that some 11,000 computers have been acquired in this context, with  schools using their own funding in some instances.  In addition, the Grant Scheme for Minor Works to National School Properties includes ICT equipment  within the range of approved school expenditure and my Department provides a  grant scheme for the provision of assistive technology, including computers,  for students with special educational needs.  I remain committed to investing in the area of ICT in schools, as resources permit.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is working with industry, via an  industry advisory group, which is chaired by Paul Rellis of Microsoft and includes other ICT industry representatives, to explore possible approaches to implementing the recommendations in the ICT Strategy Group Report.</P>
        <P>The Advisory Group is currently examining what information is available on the  quantity and type of ICT equipment that has been purchased by schools in recent  years.</P>

        <P>The Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) represents the interests, at national level, of the thirty three Vocational Education Committees. The IVEA is recognised by my Department as one of the three second level management bodies under the Education Act, 1998 and the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 2001. The IVEA fulfils a range of functions which seek to protect, promote and enhance the interests of vocational education and training within the wider education sector and the country at large.</P>
        <P>A key factor in determining the allocation of funding to IVEA is its participation as part of the Official Side in the negotiation through the industrial relation processes of issues relating to staff employed by schools or Vocational Education Committees. My Department provided grant aid of &euro;177,532 to IVEA in 2008.</P>
        <P>The participation of the relevant managerial bodies, including IVEA, as national representative bodies for Schools and Vocational Education Committees as employers of teachers and other staff in the industrial relations process is crucial to the management of this activity by <Col N="189"/>my Department. The level of service that is currently required for industrial relations issues, which includes pay, conditions of service, and employment law is significant. Servicing meetings on these issues requires that representatives of the management groups be available on a regular basis for a variety of meetings and consultations. Representatives need to be fully briefed and in a position to contribute to the formulation of Official Side agendas and positions in a constructive manner while representing the views of the management authorities on the various issues. Unlike other management bodies, IVEA has a particular remit to negotiate on behalf of all VECs on matter relating to adult, community and further education. As this is a rapidly developing area it is important that there is a uniform approach to the issues arising. IVEA brings a consistency of approach in this sector.</P>
        <P>In 2008 each VEC was required to pay a contribution of &euro;11,900 per annum towards the operating costs of the IVEA, resulting in an overall contribution of &euro;392,700 to IVEA by VECs. Any change in the annual subscription made by VECs must be approved by resolution at the annual congress of IVEA.</P>
        <P>The IVEA is an independent organisation governed under a Constitution unanimously passed at an Extraordinary Congress of the Association in 2003. IVEA has established finance and audit committees which monitor income and expenditure on an ongoing basis. The accounts of IVEA are independently audited and are submitted to my Department on an annual basis, as a prerequisite to the draw down for grant aid. In addition, the IVEA accounts are presented to its annual congress for approval.  I have no plans to monitor the day to day spending of IVEA.</P>

        <Quest> the vetting system for untrained substitute teachers; the number of untrained substitute teachers employed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The recruitment and selection of staff whether for teaching or other positions in a school rests with Boards of Management as employer. Good practice should involve the checking of recent employment records, qualifications, experience and names of referees. While across the country many substitute teachers have previous experience working in schools and may be known to schools there is clearly a heightened requirement for vigilance in checking the prior employment record where the person seeking employment is not known to the school or is approaching the school for the first time.</P>
        <P>Good practice is warranted in any event quite apart from the specific issue of safeguarding against any child protection risk. In relation to child protection the arrangements for vetting of teaching and non-teaching staff are set out in Department Circular 0094/2006 which issued to all schools in June 2006. The Circular is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The vetting arrangements were introduced in September 2006 for vetting of new teachers at the time of their initial registration with the Teaching Council regardless of whether they are likely to enter permanent employment or take up appointments as substitute or part-time teachers. The procedures also apply to prospective employees for posts that involve working with children such as Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), bus drivers, bus escorts to children with special needs, caretakers and other ancillary staff in schools.</P>
        <P>As the expansion of service by the Garda Vetting Unit is rolled out, consultations will proceed with the relevant education stakeholders on how best to introduce vetting of existing teachers that are working in any capacity &mdash; permanent, part-time or substitute in the school <Col N="190"/>system and other existing education staff working with children. The circular does require the vetting of any person being appointed to a teaching position (whether permanent, part-time or substitute) who has not been employed in the school system in the previous 3 years.</P>
        <P>Irrespective of the position on vetting by the Garda Vetting Unit where facts or information comes to a Board of Management&rsquo;s attention calling into question a person&rsquo;s suitability to work with children it is a matter for the Board to satisfy itself that the person is suitable to work in that capacity. This will naturally have to be assessed on a case by case basis. The Board will have to consider all the circumstances of the case, give due weight to all relevant factors, and afford fair procedures to the individual concerned before making a decision.</P>
        <P>The information regarding the number of unqualified substitute teachers is currently being compiled in my Department and will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. The overall policy goal is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools. However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population, the necessity to put additional accommodation in place in a short time frame, and competing pressure on the capital budget available to my Department, it is necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet accommodation needs in some circumstances.</P>

	<P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to special needs assistants (SNAs) allocated to schools to enable them support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs. As the Deputy will be aware, applications for SNA support are considered by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. There has been no change in the criteria governing the allocation of teaching and/or care resources to pupils with special educational needs. The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network. However, it is also essential that we ensure that resources are allocated in accordance with the criteria laid down.   There are now over 19,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) &mdash; compared with just 300 in 1997. The Deputy will also be aware that a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department. The objectives of a Value for Money and Policy Review are to analyse Exchequer spending in a systematic manner and to provide a basis on which more informed policy decisions can be made. The review is ongoing and to support the overall process it will include engagement with parent representatives, schools, education partners and other representative groups.  It is expected that the review will be completed by the end of 2009. </P>
